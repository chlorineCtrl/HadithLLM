If during Wudu (ablution), one finds dirt stuck on his fingers, does working on removing the dirt by scrubbing it off disrupt the continuity of the Wudu and require repeating it?",,"Praise be to Allah.Continuity would not be disrupted by such an action (according to the most viable opinion) even if his body had dried, because he was delayed due to an action required for his purity. The same is true if he were to move from one faucet to another in search of water.
However, if continuity were disrupted due to an action not related to this, like removing impurity from his clothes, eating or drinking and the like, and the limbs became dry, then he needs to repeat the Wudu.

What should a person do if one of the areas normally washed during wudu is wounded?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person is wounded in one of the areas of wudu and is not able to cover the wound with a bandage, he should perform wudu except for the wounded body part, for which he should then perform ablution with sand (tayammum).

                If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and several prayers have passed, what should he do?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) 
  on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed 
  several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl) 
  and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this 
  clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, 
  then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. 
  The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba 
  in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, 
  a translated meaning of which is: ""O' You who believe, do not get approach 
  salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure 
  due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform 
  ghusl"" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with 
  him), in which he said ""I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so 
  I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned 
  this to the Prophet  peace be upon him (or it was 
  mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah  (peace 
  be upon him) said, ""Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just 
  wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, 
  then perform ghusl""2. 
  This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral 
  discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following

3,4,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4,Is Circumcision Necessary for Conversion?,"Question

A lawyer in Argentina is asking about the ruling on circumcision for a disbelieving man or woman who wants to enter Islam.",Circumcision is not necessary for conversion to Islam because the soundness of a person’s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised.,"Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question. The issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. 
Male circumcision in Islam
As for circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam. It is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth.” [an-Nahl 16:123]
The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6/388)
Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam?
Circumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it.
Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam?
It is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a person’s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A person’s entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised .
With regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427  .

4,5,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5,When Can You Pray After a Miscarriage?,"Question

If a woman has a miscarriage and has discharge of blood, does she pray?","If you see blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas. So you should perform wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and pray.","Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding (istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)? 
The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: 
""If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas."" (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361) 
In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays. 
Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. 
For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy.  (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/292)
This is based on the report of ‘Abdullah Bin Mas’ud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: ""Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed "" (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303)
Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her.
As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: ""What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas."" (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/327)

If a person praying experiences insinuating thoughts from Shaytan in his prayer, causing him problems in reciting the Quran, and resulting in bad or evil thoughts, and making him doubt the number of completed rak’ahs, what should he do?","This is how to stay focused in prayer: 1- Seek refuge with Allah from Satan, 2- Blow with mist to the left three times.","Praise be to Allah.Satanic whispers during prayer 

This happened to one of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) whose name is ‘Uthman ibn Abi Al-’As, (may Allah be pleased with him). ’Uthman came complaining to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and said: ""The Shaytan comes between me and my prayer and causes me problems with my recitation."" So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""That is a Shaytan called Khanzab , so if you feel his presence, seek refuge in Allah and blow a mist to your left three times."" He said: ""I applied this advice and Allah has rid me of him.” (Sahih Muslim, 2203) 
Tips on how to stay focused in prayer
This hadith includes two ways on how to get rid of the shaytan while praying .

Seeking refuge in Allah from the Shaytan's evil by pronouncing the words of seeking refuge and this is OK in this case. 
Blowing with mist to the left three times. This is basically blowing air in a similar manner to spitting, but with a minute mist of saliva, on the condition that this does not disturb or bother the person next to him, nor make the masjid dirty.

If a person missed `Asr (afternoon prayer), and when he arrived at the masjid he found Maghrib (sunset prayer) had started, what should he do?","If a person missed `Asr prayer and when he arrived to the mosque he found Maghrib prayer has started, he should pray Maghrib with the imam, then pray `Asr afterwards","Praise be to Allah.Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said that if a person missed `Asr prayer and when he arrived to the mosque he found Maghrib prayer has started, he should pray Maghrib with the Imam then pray `Asr afterwards, as agreed upon by all leading scholars. 
The question of, “does he repeat Maghrib?” has two scholarly opinions:

The first is that he repeats Maghrib. This is the saying of Ibn `Umar, Malik, Abu Hanifah and Ahmad in what is most well-known about this issue. 
The second opinion is that he does not repeat Maghrib. This is the saying of Ibn `Abbas, the Shafi`i School of Fiqh, and the second opinion of Ahmad’s school of Fiqh.

The latter is more correct, for Allah did not make it obligatory on the person to offer a prayer twice if he has feared Allah as much as he can. (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Taymiyyah 22/106)

11,12,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12,How to pray if not sure imam is traveling or resident,"Question

                If a traveling person comes upon a congregation praying, and he does 
not know if: (1) the imam (prayer leader) is a traveler, meaning that he 
should join the prayer with the intention of qasr (shortening prayer), or 
(2) if he is resident, and thus should pray the complete prayer, what 
should he do?",,"Praise be to Allah.The answer that is apparent is: he acts based on what is clear 
  to him from the signs of travel on the imam from clothes or travel gear. 
  If it appears to him that the imam is resident, then he should pray the 
  complete prayer.
The evidence: what Imam Ahmad authenticated and narrated 
  that Ibn Abbas was asked: ""What is reason that the traveler prays 
  two rakaat (iterations of prayer) if he is alone and four rakaat 
  if he is led in [a full] prayer by a resident? So he said, that is the sunna 
  (tradition of the Prophet ), 
  and in another narration ""That is the sunna of Abi Al-Qasim.""
Take the case of one who assumes that the imam is a traveler, 
  and thus prays with him two rakaat with intention of qasr. Then, 
  after salaam (completion of prayer) with the imam, it becomes 
  clear to him [from speaking with others after the prayer, for example] that 
  the imam is actually a resident and that the two rakaat that he 
  had prayed were the imam’s third and fourth. In such an instance, 
  he should stand up and make two rakaat to complete the prayer, he makes 
  sujood sahw (an extra two prostrations). Whatever speaking was 
  done or questions asked to investigate do not harm his prayer.1

                If a praying person suddenly cannot stand up for the remainder of the 
prayer, or he was unable to pray standing up so he was praying sitting 
down, then he became able to stand again, what should he do?",,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudama, (may the mercy of Allah be upon him), said: 
  ""As soon as the ill person during prayer is able to do what he was not 
  able to do when he commenced the prayer, whether it be standing, sitting, bowing, 
  prostrating, or bowing, then he should move on and build on what has been already 
  completed from his prayer. The same if he began the prayer completely capable 
  of performing all actions, then suddenly became unable to perform certain actions. 
  In this case he continues praying in the best shape he can and builds on what 
  he previously had completed as though nothing has changed in his condition.""1 
  The evidence is: hadith Umran Bin Hossayn, (may Allah be pleased with 
  him), who said, ""I had bawaseer (hemorrhoids) so I asked the Prophet 
  (peace be upon him), about salaat, and he said: 'Pray standing up; if

passing.","Question

                What should one do if one is distracted during the prayer by something 
happening in ones environment, such as someone knocking on the 
door, or a child in danger, e.g. playing with an electrical outlet, etc., 
perhaps requiring him to move?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person praying needs to do something relatively minor during 
  prayer, like opening a door and the like, it is OK as long as his direction 
  does not change from the qibla (direction of prayer). The evidence for 
  this is what Abu Dawood narrated that Aa'isha (may Allah be 
  pleased with her), said, ""The Messenger of Allah  
  (peace be upon him), used to pray with the door closed, so I arrived and asked 
  him to open it, so he came and opened it and returned to his prayer"" (the 
  narrator mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qibla).1
The same is true if a mother needed, while praying, to save her 
  child from danger or harm and the likesmall movement to the right or left, 
  or forward or backward, does not harm the prayer. Similarly if the ridaa 
  (upper body cover) falls off, the praying person can pick it up and if the izar 
  (lower body cover) became loose, then he can tighten it up. The sharia 
  (laws of Islam) have allowed for the praying person in some cases excessive 
  movement even if he were to change direction from qibla, as evident in 
  the hadith of Abu Huraira, (may Allah be pleased with him), where he 
  said: ""The Messenger of Allah  (peace be upon 
  him), said: Kill the two black things while in prayer: the snake and scorpion. 
  ""2
Also, preventing a person from passing in the place of prostration 
  by pushing (or even fighting him if he insists) is prescribed, as related in 
  Bukhari from hadith Abi Saleh Al-Samman, who said: ""I saw Aba 
  Saeed Al-Khudri on Friday praying with something in front of him to protect 
  him from [passing] people, and a young man from Bani Abi Muaet wanted to pass 
  in front of him in the place of prostration. So Abu Saeed pushed the mans 
  chest, so the man looked [around] and did not find any place from which to walk 
  except in front of him, so he tried to pass in front of him again. Abu Saeed 
  pushed him harsher than the first time, so he cursed Abu Saeed. Then the young 
  man went to Marwan and complained about Abu Saeeds action and Abu Saeed 
  entered after him at Marwans place so Marwan said: What is the matter 
  with you, doing that to your brothers son oh Abu Saeed.? He said: 
  I heard the Prophet  (peace be upon him) saying: 
  ""If one of you prays with something in front of him protecting him from 
  [passing] people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should 
  push him, and if he refuses to [turn back], then fight him, for he is a shaitan

those of his or her immediate kin. 
As for Allah's right it cannot be requited but with true repentance. 
The right of the immediate kin can be requited by the murderer by handing himself over

                A man works in an air transport company. He steals a tape-recorder. After 
many years he repents. Now, should he return the same transistor radio, or 
a similar model or its equivalent price, especially considering that the 
original model is not sold in the markets now?",,"Praise be to Allah.He must return the same piece along with an additional amount equal to the reduction in 
its value that has resulted due to its usage or the course of time. Of course it is to be 
accomplished in a suitable manner without causing himself harm. However if that is 
impractical or infeasible then he can give in charity an equivalent amount in the name of 
the original owner."

I used to have money earned from usury or interest (riba), but I have spent it all and none of it remains with me. Now I want to repent. What am I required to do?",,"Praise be to Allah.Nothing is required of you except repentance and seeking forgiveness from your Lord. Note that riba is a very serious and grave issue, seeing that Allah did not declare war in the Quran against anyone except the one who accepts riba. Since the money earned from riba has all gone, then there is nothing due from you in its regard.

                What should a person do with the profits he made from selling cigarettes, when it has been mixed with other lawful money?",,"Praise be to Allah.
    He who has 
    done business in things that are prohibited in Islam, such as musical 
    instruments, prohibited cassettes, cigarettes etc. while knowing the ruling 
    on them then wishes to repent, needs to give away in charity all the profits 
    he made from them. This will be a means of purification and will not be 
    counted as spending in the way of Allah, for Allah is pure and does not 
    accept but the pure.

    Further, if 
    this money gets mixed up with other earnings, as in the case of a shop owner 
    who sells many other items, then if he can compute the amount of profits 
    made from them, he should do so in the hope of purifying the rest of his 
    earnings.

    In other 
    words, he who has some money earned through unlawful means and intends to 
    repent, should:

          
    1- If he was an unbeliever at the time of earning the money, he is not 
    obliged to atone for them or seek their purification. For the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not demand from his followers that 
    they purify their wealth after coming into the fold of Islam.

          
    2- If he was Muslim at the time of earning the money, well aware of its 
    Islamic ban and prohibition, then he should separate it out at the time of

A man used to accept bribes. Then Allah guided him to righteousness. What should he do with what he used to earn as bribes?",,"Praise be to Allah.There can be two situations.
Either the bribes he used to accept were from those that had been wronged who had to offer bribes as a means of obtaining what was their right, in which case the repentant should return them their amounts or articles or whatever, for what he took from them is considered as having been taken by force or through deceit. Or, the bribe was taken from an unjust (zalim) man like he was himself before he repented. That is, someone who achieved or attained things via bribes which were not his right. This amount is not to be returned to him. Instead the repentant should spend it in a charitable way, such as on the poor and the destitute. Likewise, he must repent from the harm he caused to people by giving their right away to others who had no right to them, but rather obtained them via the use of bribes.

                I used to do forbidden things and get paid for them. Now I have 
repented. Do I have to return the amounts thus earned?",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, one who commits haram (forbidden) deeds and accepts payments for them, should 
get rid of the amounts earned from them when he repents. But such amounts should not be 
returned to those who paid them.
For instance, when a call-girl repents, she should not return her wages of sin to her 
customers. When a singer repents he should not return the wages he earned to the band to 
which he belonged or the party which paid. When a man who used to sell wine or drugs 
repents he should not return the amounts to those who used to buy from him. Nor should he 
who used to swear for others as a false witness return the amounts he earned to those for 
whose benefit he used to swear. The reason being that if he returns the amounts to him who 
paid, then he will be depositing with him both the unlawful money as well as the unlawful 
commodity that he took through bribe or wages of sin. Therefore it will be enough if he gets 
rid of such unlawful earning himself. This is the preference of Sheikh al-Islam Ibn 
Taimiyyah as well as his pupil Ibn ul-Qayyim as stated in his Madarij."

have woven and dyed and what has been imported from their 
countries are also permissible, as long as they do not comprise 
anything haram (forbidden), because the Prophet 
 (peace be

As for divorce , the ‘iddah for a pregnant woman is until she delivers her child. 
The ‘iddah for one who still menstruates, is three menstrual cycles, whereas for one who is either too young or too old to menstruate, it is three months.

30,32,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32,Repentance From Fornication and Status of Child,"Question

                There is another problem that has been worrying me for some time—namely, I committed fornication with a woman. How do I repent? Can I marry her in order to cover up the whole affair?

Another man says he committed fornication outside his country, and he knows that the woman conceived and delivered a child. Is this his child? And is it obligatory for him to bear the costs of the child’s upbringing?",,"Praise be to Allah.
    Questions of this sort are 
    asked so often and by so many that it is time Muslims paid serious attention 
    to their reformation in the light of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic 
    teachings), in order that such things do not occur in the first place. 
    Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily 
    contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full 
    hijab (women’s Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in 
    particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted 
    travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question 
    about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations.

    Either the man did it by force, 
    that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr 
    (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm 
    he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the 
    matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to 
    the law of shari’ah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a 
    woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except 
    repentance. Neither the child is his, nor is the cost of upbringing born by 
    him because it is an illegal child and must be attached to the mother and 
    not the father. 

    The man’s marriage to the 
    woman, for the sake of covering up the issue, is also not permissible. For 
    Allah revealed in the Quran a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “An 
    adulterer does not marry but an adulteress or mushrika (female polytheist). 
    And an adulteress does not marry but an adulterer or mushrik (male 
    polytheist).” (24:3)

    It is also not permissible to 
    marry a woman who is pregnant from an adulterous act, even if the man has 
    fathered the baby in the womb, as it is also not permissible to marry a 
    woman about whom it is not known if she is pregnant or not.

    Nonetheless, if he repents, and 
    she also repents, and she is not carrying a child, then it is permissible 
    for him to marry her and begin a new life. If she is carrying a child, they 
    must wait until she gives birth.

would like to know if it is necessary for her to confess to her husband what she

himself or herself just as Allah has concealed them. A true repentance should suffice.
As for he who married a virgin, but it became apparent to him at consummation that she is 
not so for reasons of promiscuity committed before marriage, then he has the to take back 
the mahr (dower) he paid her and separate from her. Nevertheless, if he finds that she has 
truly repented, then if he keeps it confidential and conceals the matter and retains her in

urgently, passionately and sincerely for no worse combination of punishments was sent by 
Allah as the ones in the case of the people of Lut (asws), who used to commit this filthy 
crime. The combination of punishments was as follows:
They were blinded and left groping, as Allah said, “fa-tamasna a’yoonahum” (i.e., 
blinded them).
A thunderous cry (tore their hearts) (al-sayha)
Their homes were turned upside down.
Allah rained upon them a storm of stones of baked clay prepared specifically for them

Accordingly the punishment if Islam for sodomy is death whether the two involved are

    Sale of such banned articles is not permissible in Islam. The Prophet (peace

    He forbids its price (as well).” (i.e., its sale/purchase/trading.) [Abu 
    Dawood, and it is authentic] Also, you know well that whomever you sell it 
    to will use it in a forbidden act; thus, it is not permissible for you to 
    sell it to him as Allah has prohibited this in commanding us (in meaning): 
    ‘do not assist one another in sins and enmity’.

    
    And no matter how much you lose in worldly wealth, have faith that what is 
    in store with Allah is worthier and longer lasting. He will compensate you

35,37,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37,Repentance from Spreading Anti-Islamic Materials,"Question

I was a misguided person spreading secularist ideologies, and writing heretical stories and articles, and using my poetry as a vehicle to spread corruption and liberalism. Then Allah turned to me with His mercy and brought me forth from darkness into light. How should I repent?",,"Praise be to Allah.This of course is a great blessing of Allah and a favor. We pray to Allah that He grant you perseverance.
As for those who were engaged with their tongue and their pen in a war against Islam by spreading distorted ideologies and doctrines, or by spreading misguided innovations and corruption, the following is incumbent upon them:
Announce their repentance and renounce all that they used to spread in antagonism to Islam, in order that the renunciation becomes well known, and so that no one can claim to be misguided by their disowned writings. This renunciation is an obligation and is a precondition for the acceptance of repentance.
Allah says (what means):
“Save for those who repent, make amends and show clearly [what they used to say/rule wrongly], it is from those whom I accept their repentance, and I am very Forgiving, very Compassionate.”
[2:160]
The tafseer (explanation) for this verse indicates that it was revealed regarding the scholars of ahl ul-kitab (People of the Book) who used to conceal what had been revealed regarding the signs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the commands to believe in him.
The repentant person should now engage themselves in the spread of the truth of Islam, spending their energies in defense of its teachings, and educating people in their religion. They should use their power of speech or writing to counterattack the forces of falsehood, to expose their deceits, plans and strategies, even as he used to co-operate with them in opposing Islam, and thus become a sword in the defense of Islam. It is also binding on he who convinced another man, even if in a private meeting, against things declared haram (forbidden) by Islam, such as, for instance, taking interest, to get in touch with the person he was instrumental in changing his opinion and let him know of his own renewed enlightenment.

36,38,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38,Can You Pray the Same Salah Twice?,"Question

If a person has already prayed in a mosque then goes to another one and finds people there praying the congregational prayer, should he pray again?","If you pray in a mosque and then go to another one and find the people there praying, then you should join them and your prayer would be a nafl prayer.","Praise be to Allah.If a person prays in a mosque and then goes to another one to attend a lecture or for any other reason, and finds the people there praying, then he should join them and his prayer would be considered a supererogatory (nafilah, nafl, tatawwu‘) prayer . 
He should do so even if it is during the prohibited times of prayer because there is a reason behind it. The evidence for this comes from what has been narrated in the hadith of Yazid bin Al-Aswad (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sunan Al-Tirmidhi in the chapter on “What has been reported about a person who prayed alone and then joins a congregation”:
“He said: I performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and prayed Fajr with him in Masjid Al-Khayf. When he completed his prayer and turned around, he found two people who did not pray with him. He said: I have to talk to them. So he came to them and they were trembling. He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that. If you already prayed at your places and then came to a congregational mosque, pray with them too and it will become a supererogatory prayer for you.”
(Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, No. 219; Sahih Al-Jami‘, No. 667)
 In another hadith it is narrated that the two came after the Fajr prayer which is a prohibited time for prayer. Imam Malik has reported in Muwatta in the chapter on “What has been narrated about repeating the prayer with the Imam after a person has prayed individually”:
Mihjan (may Allah be pleased with him), says that he was in the company of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in congregation and returned while Mihjan himself did not pray with them. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: What prevented you from praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim? He said: Indeed, O Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)! But I had already prayed at home. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: When you come (to the mosque) then pray with the people even if you have prayed.”

                What should one do if one is praying the sunnah prayer 
in the mosque and the iqamah is called?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person enters the mosque and is praying the sunnah while the 
iqamah is called, then the best opinion in this case is that if he is in 
his second rak‘ah, he should shorten it, and if he is in the first 
rak‘ah, he should just break his prayer and enter the congregation 
with the Imam1. The evidence for this comes from what Imam 
Muslim has narrated in his Sahih:
Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) said: If iqamah is 
called for the prayer then there is no prayer except the 
obligatory one. 
  (Sahih Muslim, 1/493) 
So, if one has performed the ruku‘ for the second rak‘ah, then he 
should complete the prayer, and if not, then he should discontinue 
because what is left from his sujud and tashahhud is not needed any 
more. Moreover, he should break without salaam, and it is enough 
to have the intention in the heart, contrary to common

38,40,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40,Informed about correct direction of qiblah during prayer,"Question

                What should one who is informed about the correct direction of the qiblah 
during a prayer?",,"Praise be to Allah.If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the 
right direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is 
also true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been 
performed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration 
by Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that:
While the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) was praying towards 
Bayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of 
meaning): 
Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards 
the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that 
shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of 
Al-Masjid Al-Haram. 
  (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). 
A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found 
them (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of 
ruku‘ in the Fajr prayer in the second rak‘ah. He 
shouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. 
So, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet 
 
and his Companions) have. 
  (Sahih Musim, No. 527) 
 If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it 
was made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of 
qiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying 
together in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some 
towards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference 
of opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was 
complete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If 
there was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he 
should follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah.1 
For the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if 
he can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability 
with the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is 
reliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and 
complete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of 
those who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform 
them of the correct direction of qiblah.
If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and 
prayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was 
careless.2

39,41,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41,"One praying behind the imam misses a rukn (obligatory part) of the 
prayer","Question

                What should one do if one is praying behind an imam and one misses one 
of the obligatory parts (arkaan)of the prayer?",,"Praise be to Allah.If someone is praying in a congregation and the loud speaker stops working or the 
person is drowsy, and he lags behind the Imam by one or more obligatory acts 
(arkaan) of prayer (i.e., the Imam performed it and he could not because of not hearing 
the Imam’s voice), then when he returns to consciousness or the sound of the speaker 
returns back, he should complete the missed obligatory acts and then continue with the 
Imam. This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam 
recited a verse that contains the word of prostration (sajdah) and the people 
misunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when 
the Imam says takbeer for ruku‘ at the end of the verse and performs ruku‘, some of 
the followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the takbeer for 
the prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from 
the ruku‘ saying “sami‘a Allahu li man hamidah”, they return back (stand up) from 
their prostration. Thus, they missed the act of ruku‘ and standing up from it. So it is 
incumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. 
This is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally 
lags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long 
supplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the 
majority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive 
obligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful.1 However, in 
principle the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet 
 (peace be upon 
him):
The Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him. When he makes 
the takbeer, make the takbeer, when he goes into ruku‘, make ruku‘. When he 
says “samia‘ Allahu li man hamidah” (Allah hears he who praises Him), say 
“Rabbanaa lakal Hamd” (O our Lord! To You belongs the Praise). When he 
goes into sajdah, make sajdah. If he prays sitting, then all should be sitting.   (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 689)"
40,42,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42,Imam nullifies his ablution during prayer,"Question

                What happens if the Imam nullifies his ablution during the prayer? Or what 
if he suddenly recalls that he in fact was not in a state of wudu’ in the first 
place? What should he do? Is the prayer of the people praying behind him 
still valid or do they need to make up all or part of it?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the Imam enters the state that nullifies his ablution or prayer, or remembers during the 
prayer that he did not perform ablution, then he should come out from prayer and 
appoint someone from the attendees who can lead them to completion. This has been 
narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, ‘Alqamah and ‘Ataa’. If he did not appoint anyone and the 
people prayed individually, this would be acceptable, and this is the opinion taken by 
Imam Al-Shafi‘i. If he elected someone and advanced him to lead them, that is also 
permitted. The evidence for this is what has been narrated regarding ‘Umar (may Allah 
be pleased with him) when he was stabbed. He took Abdur Rahman bin ‘Auf who led 
the prayer to completion.1
And the reason for this deduction is that ‘Umar did so in the presence of a number of 
Companions and others and no one opposed this act, so it became a consensus 
(ijma‘).2
If the Imam remembers that he is not in a state of purity, he should indicate to the 
followers to remain as they are and purify himself and come back to lead them. The 
evidence for this is the following narration of Abu Dawud from Abu Bakrah:
The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) entered into the Fajr prayer and 
indicated to the people that they should stay in their places. Then he came back to 
lead them and water was dripping from his head. 
  (Sunan Abi Dawud, No. 233; Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/45) 
 Commenting on this hadith, Imam Al-Khatabi says:
 In this hadith there is an evidence that if one is leading the people in prayer while in a 
state of impurity and the people do no know of it, then their prayer is unaffected and 
there is no need for them to repeat it. But the Imam has to repeat his prayer.3
If one is praying (either as Imam or follower or individually) and recalls that he had 
wiped over his socks during wudu’ while the duration of wiping had expired, he should 
terminate his prayer because his ablution is incorrect. This is what has been quoted from 
Imams Ahmad and Al-Shafi‘i.4

‘awrah” (in Arabic “ghatti il-‘awrah”), or “protect what has been 
uncovered”. He must not stay quiet and continue to pray because it 
is known that the Imam’s prayer (in the said condition) is incorrect

recommended for him to change the place with the person next to 
him. In doing this he should be careful not to speak; rather, he should 
use some gestures (hand movements, etc.). The evidence for this is 
the hadith narrated by Samrah who said:
The Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) said: If one of you 
dozes during the Friday sermon, he should exchange his 
position with the person sitting next to him.   (Al-Baihaqi, 3/238; Sahih Al-Jami‘ No. 812)

What should one do if one finds oneself unsure in the middle of the prayer how many raka’at one has prayed?","If you are not sure if you prayed three or four rak`ahs, you should consider the most likely case. If you cannot put more weight to one of the two, you should assume what you are certain of and that is the lesser amount, and make sujud al-sahw.","Praise be to Allah.If a person falls into doubt as to whether he prayed , e.g., three of four rak`ahs he should consider the most likely case. However, if he cannot put more weight to one of the two , he should assume what he is certain of and that is the lesser amount, and make the prostrations of forgetfulness (sujud al-sahw ). 
The evidence is the hadith narrated by Abu Sa‘id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: If one of you has doubts during his prayer and he does not recall how many rak`ahs he has prayed, whether three or four, then he can put an end to his doubt by praying according to what he was certain of (the lesser amount) and then making two sujud before the salam. If it turns out that he had prayed five rak`ahs, the two sujud would make it even.

                What should one do if one remembers in the final 
tashahhud that one recited at tahiyyaat in the beginning 
of the rak’ah instead of al-Fatihah?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the Imam remembers in the final tashahhud (sitting of the prayer) 
that he had recited at-tahiyyaat (the greetings mentioned during the 
sitting) in the beginning of the rak‘ah instead of Al-Fatihah, he 
should stand up and offer another rak‘ah, which is correct in 
exchange for the one he performed incorrectly and did not recite 
Al-Fatihah. This is because the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) 
said:
There is no prayer for the one who did not recite (in it) 
Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter of the Qur’an).   (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 723) 
It is also required for the followers to follow him even though it 
would be the fifth rak‘ah for them. If they do not understand and do 
not stand up, and say “subhan Allah” to indicate to Imam that he is 
error, the Imam should inform them by hand movements to the right 
and left to tell them that he did it purposefully and to indicate to them 
to stand up.
However, if something like this happens to one of the followers 
behind the Imam, his prayer will be correct as long as he followed his 
Imam.
The evidence for this is the Hadith of Abu Bakrah when he entered 
into the prayer in the position of ruku‘ and did not recite Al-Fatihah. 
The Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) said to him:
May Allah increase your endeavor. You do not need to repeat. 
(Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 750) 
If the follower forgets to recite Al-Fatihah or is ignorant of its 
obligatory nature or finds the Imam in the state of ruku‘, then his 
rak‘ah will be considered as complete and his prayer correct. He 
does not need to repeat the rak‘ah, as he is his excused due to 
ignorance or forgetfulness or if he missed catching the qiyam (the 
position standing upright). This is the opinion of the majority of 
scholars.1

during ruku’","Question

                What should one do if one forgets to mention a required tasbeeh during ruku’ and remembers just afterwards after rising up?",,"Praise be to Allah.If someone, after raising his head from ruku‘,
remembers that he did not say the supplications of ruku‘, he should not return
back to the ruku‘ because the requirement for supplication of ruku‘
has been dropped by virtue of his rising it. If he returns back to the ruku‘
intentionally, this action would render his prayer invalid since he added an extra rukn
(pillar, or obligatory act of the prayer) which is this second superfluous ruku‘.
However, if he did it in ignorance or forgetfulness, his prayer will not be nullified, but
in this case he must make the prostration of forgetfulness if he was praying individually
or leading a congregation. This is because tasbeeh (subhaana Rabbi al-Azeem, How
Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme, or another supplication of ruku‘) is wajib
(required), and forgetting it makes the prostration of forgetfulness necessary. If he was
praying behind an Imam, the he is released from the requirement of sujood for his
forgetfulness (al-Mughni 1/679)."
48,50,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50,What to Do If You Miss the First Tashahhud,"Question

What should one do if one forgets the first tashahhud (sitting after the second rak’ah)?","If you forget the first tashahhud, stand up for the third rak`ah and start the recitation of Al-Fatihah, then you should not return to the sitting position, but you have to offer Sujud As-Sahw before the salam.","Praise be to Allah.If one forgets the first tashahhud , stands up for the third rak`ah and starts the recitation of Al-Fatihah, then according to the majority of scholars, he should not return back to the sitting position. If he does return knowing that his return is unapproved of, his prayer will be nullified because he has already started another obligatory act. Due to his missing the wajib (i.e., tashahhud ) he is forced to make the prostrations of forgetfulness . 
The evidence is the hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah bin Shu‘bah that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: If the Imam stands up after the second rak`ah, and remembers that he has to sit, before he straightens himself (upright), then he should sit down, and if he straightened upright, he should not sit and make two prostrations of forgetfulness .
(Abu Dawud, No. 1036; Silsilah Al-Sahihah, 321)
In short, if someone stands up for the third rak`ah, forgetting the tashahhud , he is in one of the three situations:

He remembers it before standing up straight: then he should return to tashahhud.
He remembers after standing up straight, and before starting the recitation of Al-Fatihah: then it is better for him not to sit, but if he sits his prayer will be correct.
He remembers it after starting the recitation of Al-Fatihah: then he is not allowed to return to tashahhud. (al-Mughni 1/677) 

These three cases have been deduced from the above Hadith.

If we can give them the money back, is the money lawful for them to use 
as they please?

these people for donations?",,"Praise be to Allah.1 & 2. If a donor's intention when he donated the money was for the purchase of the 
particular land in question, you became his trustee and representative with this money. If the 
efforts to buy this land have stopped or been cancelled, and the donor requests the return 
of the amount donated, then he has the right to have the money returned to him. However, 
since this money has been donated for the sake of Allah and is a sadaqa, they cannot 
spend it for personal use. You need to advise them that it then becomes their responsibility 
to spend it for a similar charitable purpose. 
However, if the intention at the time of donation was for the purpose of the project and not

What is the ruling if a woman’s period lasts longer than 15 days?","If blood continues to flow and a woman is still waiting to purify herself, and it exceeds 15 days, then she should fall back to her normal period as a reference. So, she must make ghusl, start praying, and make up the prayers for the days which she did not pray since the time when her normal period would have ended.","Praise be to Allah.If blood continues to flow and a woman is still waiting to purify herself, and it exceeds 15 days, then she should fall back to her normal period as a reference. Accordingly, she must make ghusl, and start praying , and in addition make up the prayers for the days which she did not pray since the time when her normal period would have ended.
For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she was still waiting for the end of the period. In this case, she makes ghusl immediately, and starts praying , and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl.
The reason for this is that the longest that a woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days according to Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388). 
Thus, if the flow continues past 15 days , then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered istihadah (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.)
Regarding making up the missed prayers, she should pray them consecutively in order by intention, in one session, and she can rest if she gets tired.

would say takbeer when prostrating and when raising his head from the prostration, then 
another takbeer when prostrating (for the second time), and when raising his head from the

to do the same in every raka'a until he completed the prayer. On completion of the prayer, 
he would say, ""By Him in Whose Hands my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to that

often as a result of a clash of desires between parents 
and their daughter. It could be for a benefit or interest 
the mother or father sees and the young woman doesnt, 
and each regards the issue from a different perspective 
or with a particular consideration. And perhaps the 
opinion of the parents is the appropriate and correct one 
as a result of their prior trials and longer experience in 
life, and perhaps the woman sometimes looks to the 
appearance of the groom more than anything else, 
whereas the parents may look to other considerations, 
such as his family status, or his long-term career or 
employment. Of course none of this means that the 
womans opinion isnt sometimes more correct and 
preferable, particularly when the opinion of the parents 
stems from a benefit they may realize if the marriage is 
accomplished, and they do not actually make the 
priority their daughter who is the most important thing in 
this issue. And while being vigilant in advising you of the 
importance of obeying ones parents and struggling with 
oneself to realize their wishes and desires and giving 
their opinion the priority, the point must clearly be made 
that the following two hadeeth from the Prophet 
  
(peace be upon him) must be abided by and carried out, 
as within them are the complete answer to your question 
and questions from others in similar situations:
The first hadeeth:
If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) 
pleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry 
him, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and 
vast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan 
Tirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih 
ul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to 
refer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the 
cutting off of relations among the people and relatives, 
and the spreading of hatred)
The second:
Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a 
young woman came to the Prophet 
  (peace be 
upon him) and said, My father married me to his 
brothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his 
standing among the people, so the Prophet 
  
(peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. 
asserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned 
on her approval and negated by her refusal). So she 
said, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I 
wanted women to know that fathers cannot force their 
will in these matters.
And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn 
Buraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her 
and said, My father married me to his brothers son in 
order to raise his standing among the people and I am 
unwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the 
Prophet 
  (peace be upon him) comes. So the 
Prophet 
  (peace be upon him) came and she 
informed him of the situation, so he sent for her father 
and invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in 
the brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I 
have authorized and endorsed what my father has done, 
but I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter 
or not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min

Is it OK for a husband to marry a second wife, without the consent of the first wife just because the man, or husband, in our case, falls in love with another woman? Should he marry her, even though he is already married? Does Islam allow such a situation for a man?","No evidence appears, either in the Quran or the sunnah, requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry a second wife.","Praise be to Allah.Man-woman relationship before marriage
Before responding to this question, a comment must be made regarding an objectionable and reprehensible issue implied in the question, and that is the mentioning by the sister that he “falls in love with another woman”. 
It is known that it is not permissible in the Islamic religion to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who is ajanabiyya to him (lit. foreign, i.e., marriageable) before marriage, for Allah revealed in Surat al-Maidah (the Table), ayah 5 a verse whose meaning can be translated as:
“This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste and virtuous women who are believers, but chaste women among People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).”
 And the word “akhdan” that appears in this ayah (appearing above as “secret intrigues”) means intimate friend or companion, and in this case refers to a lover , and Allah has indicated in Surat al-Ahzab (33:53) that a condition for talking with women when it is needed is: (a translation of the meaning)
 “…and if you ask them (women) for something you want, ask them from behind a hijab (both in the sense of a physical barrier such as a screen or wall, as well as in clothing); that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs…”
And Allah has commanded women not to speak with soft, sensual voices with a man who is ajnabi (lit. foreign, meaning one to whom marriage is not forbidden) so that he is not tempted by their voices, and so as not to provoke feelings of lust. Allah ta'ala said in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 32, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:
“… if you do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire; but utter sufficient and appropriate speech.” (33:32)
So how could it possibly be permissible after all of these injunctions to establish love or friendship relations among women and men who are ajanib (marriageable)?
Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam
And as for the original matter of the question, Allah (subhanahu wa-ta’ala), Who is al-Hakim (All Wise) al-Khabir (All Experienced), and Who is more knowledgeable about the human beings He created than they themselves are about themselves, has ordained that a man is allowed to marry whom he wills among women as long as he does not bond in marriage under his care and responsibility more than four women . 
And this is conditioned upon him dealing justly among them the known justice specified by Shari’ah which includes overnight stays and spending. 
If he does not have the ability and capacity to deal with such justice , then he should suffice with one, as Allah indicates in Surat al-Nisa in ayah 3, which has a meaning that can be translated as:
“… marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one…” (4:3)
And Allah’s Shari’ah (law) is all just and wise, and He ordains what He wills and does what He wants and it is incumbent upon as human beings to believe and have faith and submit and obey and abide by the Shari`ah, otherwise then we are not Muslims nor mu’minin (believers). As Allah also said in Surat al-Nisa, ayah 65, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:
“But no, by your Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction” (4:65)
and in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 36, a meaning that can be translated as:
“It is not fitting for a mu’min (believing man) or mu’minah (believing woman) when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Apostle he is indeed strayed on a manifestly wrong path.” (33:36)
Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife?
Furthermore, no evidence appears either in the Quran or sunnah requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry another wife, and therefore he is not required to ask her permission. 
However, he needs to be judicious in taking this decision and to weigh it carefully with respect to benefits and drawbacks and to look with the eye of wisdom at all of the considerations pertaining to the matter, and he should strive all he can to conciliate, reassure, and satisfy his first wife, in order to ease and mitigate the effect of the matter upon her."

How much is Nesab el-Zakat in US dollars?",,"Praise be to Allah.Nisab ul-Zakat for naqd (gold and silver) is defined as the minimum amount of naqd specified by shari’a below which one is not required to pay zakat, whereas if one’s wealth exceeds it then zakat becomes incumbent.
And it is known that zakat ul-maal (wealth) in shari’a is required for the two types of naqd—gold and silver—and what serves their function in modern times (commonly referred to as cash), whether it is dollars or riyals or pounds or otherwise.
Nisab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.
Nisab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.
It is well known that there is a noticeable disparity between the value of nisab for gold and that of silver in our times. The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days). If the amount reaches the value of nisaab for silver or more, then he should pay from it for every 1000 dollars, 25 dollars (i.e., 2.5%) to be spent in the prescribed benficiaries as specified by shari’ah, and we ask Allah to aid us and help us succeed in haqq il-maal wa salla allahu ala nabiyyana muhammad"

My friend is asking againHe was working in a restaurant, serving everything except wine (khamr)but the meat there is not halal and he knows that; he was carrying the empty glasses of wine and washing them, he knows that that is not allowed. His Q is: he felt guilty so he left the restaurant. He had money out of that job and he wants to start a new halal business.
CAN HE USE THAT MONEY TO START A NEW JOB? IF HIS MONEY IS NOT HALAL, DOES HE NEED TO GET RID OF THAT MONEY OR CAN HE WORK WITH IT AND FROM THE PROFIT HE CAN TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY?
WAJAZAKUM ALLAH KHAYRAYAMAN",,"Praise be to Allah.The job which this brother was performing is the kind in which halal and haram have been mixed together. At the same time that he was serving food that contained haram ingredients such as pork or lahm ul-maita (meat not properly slaughtered), he was serving things that are halal as well washing dishes and glasses. If he had known at the time he was working about the prohibition of the haram things, then his income in this situation comprises mixed money, both halal and haram. So if he wants to repent to Allah, then he needs to get rid of the portion of his income which his haram, by estimating and approximating to his best judgment how much the haram portion of the income was which was earned via haram service. He can spend it in any of the various charitable means, and he cannot benefit from it whether by investment or otherwise. As for the remaining portion which is the halal amount, he is allowed to use it to his benefit."

but he must work to support himself and his study. what 
makes the problem worse is that he must find a job by 
Sept 97 otherwise he will be illegal and will be kicked 
out of the country. So my questions are: (1) is working 
in life insurance companies Haram? (2) Are this

loosing everything?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah). Life insurance is among the most 
severely prohibited types of insurance if not the single worst one. It

in helping people towards sin and enmity.

difficulty and distress that he has fallen into, I can but say:

64,79,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/79,Ruling on Congregational Prayer in the Mosque,"Question

Dear brother in faith.
I start with the name of Allah. I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous question which was of a great help to our community (All thanks be to Allah).
What is the Islamic point-of-view regarding those who attend Friday prayers in the Masjid and fail to attend any other of the daily prayers? Do you have to attend the prayers at the Masjid if time permits?",,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allah A- Evidence From The Quran
First Evidence
Our Lord tabaraka wa ta'aala said what may be translated as {And when you [i.e., the commander of an army] are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102)
I say:

In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, ""and let the other party ...""
There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party.
Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory.
This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse.

Second Evidence
Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as ""The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused."" (Quran 68:42-43)
The evidence here is from several facets amongst them:

Allah punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate.
The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadith of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him ""do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)""? He said yes, then the Prophet said ""fahayhala"" which means something like ""then go answer the call."" This hadith is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad.
So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered.

Third Evidence
Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as ""Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing"". (Quran 2:43)
The proof therein is:

That Allah ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat.
His statement which was translated as ""with those that are bowing"" is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation.

B- Evidence From The Sunnah
First Evidence
Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said ""The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them."" Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version.
This hadith proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah.
Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadith which follow:

They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadith of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer ""I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer"". This is not in contradiction to the hadith of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadith of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning.
They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge.
They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors:

 
The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation.
The second: Confirming what the Messenger cancelled. For he never punished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept from them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them and Allah.
As such the hadith of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the obligation of salat al jama'ah.
Second Evidence
What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, ""Oh Messenger of Allah, I do not have someone to guide me to the Mosque,"" and thus asked the Messenger to grant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, the Messenger called him and said ""Do you hear the call? "", he said ""yes"". He said, ""Then answer."" Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by Ibn Maktoom that he said: ""Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have a guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?"" He said ""Do you hear the call?"" Ibn Maktoom replied ""Yes"". The Prophet then said ""I cannot find an excuse for you"". If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in congregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see?
Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, ""This is an order to pray in congregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah"".
The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive evidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about supportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory.
If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply preference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying preference, and nothing would remain obligatory.
Third Evidence
Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the Prophet said, ""Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse."" This is a sound, and authentic hadith.
Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat ""... and mind you this chain (referring to chain of narration of the above hadith) is authentic."" This hadith has been narrated by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also been traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken about this hadith, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic word mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to the Prophet contradict their claim.
That hadith states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and this judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order which implies preference, and not obligation.
Fourth Evidence
Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then let him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda (guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to establish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be abandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of your prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that purifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these mosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), and raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would be carried between two men until he is stood in the row.
In another narration he said, ""the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and amongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called"". Narrated by Muslim.
The evidence in this hadith is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of confirmed hypocrisy.
It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is obligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in whose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites in their attributes.
Fifth Evidence

Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah said, ""If there are three let one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is the one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount memorized, and ability to recite it properly)"".
Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah said ""There are not three in a town where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established amongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to jama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one"". Authentic hadith narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmed.

Sixth Evidence
Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the Mu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got up from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the Masjid. Then Abu Huraira said ""as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the Messenger) "". Narrated by Muslim.
Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal Qasim , and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of the sunnah of Abal Qasim . And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then he has left something which is obligatory.
These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim servant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will find more and more.
Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to reject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled differently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded differently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and Sunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become Imam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah.
Know this because it is beneficial to you...
Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the companions of the Messenger , have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no narrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. And following is what has been confirmed by them:

Ibn Mas'ood said, ""and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known."" (5th evidence)
Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have stated, ""Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse."" (3rd evidence)

Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: ""These are statements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is not one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of these pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one another. Verily in Allah is our success.""
These are the statements of the people of knowledge:

Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3/349), ""More than one of the companions were of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is no salat for him.""
Ata'a bin Rabah said, ""There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or country side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.""
Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, ""If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in congregation, out of pity, he should not obey her.
Al-Awza'i said: ""There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or the daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer or not.""
Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, Al-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and most of Ahl Al-hadith, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i.

You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning the obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as such from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.)
Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is correct; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the acceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of Zaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not.
We ask Allah to help us in remembering and thanking him and better worshipping him. Allah the exalted knows best."
65,81,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/81,Can Tawaf and Sa`i Be Interrupted?,"Question

Is it permissible to interrupt tawaf or sa`i?","If a person is performing tawaf or sa`i and he comes across a need (e.g., he is thirsty and wants to drink something, or loses someone and stops to look for him, or becomes tired and wants to take some rest), and if the break was short, then he may continue his tawaf from where he left off.","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to interrupt tawaf or sa`i?
If a person is performing tawaf (circumambulation around the Ka`bah) or sa`i (between Safa and Marwah), and he comes across a need (e.g., he is thirsty and wants to drink something, or loses someone from his family members and stops to look for him, or becomes tired and wants to take some rest), and if the break was short, then he may continue his tawaf from where he left off . 
Can you interrupt tawaf for prayer?
If the prayer is called and he interrupts his tawaf to pray , the scholars have disagreed on this issue. The most conservative opinion is that when he continues his tawaf, he should not count the last round which he left incomplete.
Can you take a rest in tawaf and sa`i?
The issue of taking a rest in tawaf and sa`i , however, is based on the condition that tawaf and sa`i should be completed contiguously. 
Continuity in tawaf and sa`i
In sa`i, continuity is not a requirement according to the best opinion.
So, if a person is performing sa`i, and he breaks after some of the rounds, and then comes back to complete them, this would be considered permissible. 
However, regarding continuity of tawaf , the scholars have two opinions:

That continuity is mandatory, and that a long discontinuity without due justification nullifies the tawaf.
That continuity is a sunnah, and the tawaf is not nullified even though the break was long. However, it is better to act according to the first opinion. (See Fatawa Al-Hajj Wal 'Umrah by Ibn Baz, p. 80; Al Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/47 and 49; Al-Mughni, 3/414)"

they hope to reach some place to bury him (such as an island or beach) in a day or two and if they 
are confident that the body will not decay. However, if they cannot, they should wash the body, 
shroud and protect it, then pray the funeral prayer, and finally, tie something heavy to it and drop it in

                What should one do if one is asked to perform something at work that he feels is 
contrary to the teachings of Islam?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person is ordered to perform a certain assignment at his work, he should consider itif the act 
does not involve any disobedience to Allah (subhaanahu WA ta'aala) he should execute it. Otherwise, 
if it does involve some disobedience to Allah (subhaanahu WA ta'aala), he should not obey the 
command, or else he will be a partner in sin and wrong-doing. The Prophet  (peace be upon him)

(Sahih Al-Bukhari with Fath Al-Bari, 13/121; Ahmad, 1/91; and the context is found in Al-Silsilah 
As-Sahihah, No. 181)
And Allah (subhaanahu wa ta'aala) said (about the people who went astray) in the Qur'an (an 
interpretation of the meaning):
""They will say: Our Lord! We followed in the footsteps of our leaders and elders and they 
misguided us from the right path""."
68,84,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/84,Minimum Distance for Shortening Prayer,"Question

What is the distance which, once one has set out for it, allows one to shorten the prayer?",The majority of scholars view that the distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is equivalent to 88.7 kms.,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars comprising the Malikis and the Shafi’is and the Hanbalis have taken the opinion that the recognized distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is four burud (an antiquated unit of distance), which is two average day's travel by heavily-loaded camels (equivalent to 88.7 km in distance). 
Among what they have quoted as evidence is what was authentically (sahih) narrated by Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to shorten the prayers and break fasting at a distance of four BURUD. 
This quoted distance is approximate and not exactly limited as per the majority of scholars, and thus what is slightly less is exempted as well.
Some scholars including Ibn Qadamah and Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his pupil Ibn al-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as travel in practice and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'ah such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan. 
Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Quran and sunnah, as in the example of Surat al-Nisa, verses 4:101-102:
""When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.""
And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to `Umar ibn al-Khattab ""Verily Allah has said ' if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure."" 'Umar said, ""[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' "" (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.)
Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Khalid ibn Asid said to Ibn `Umar, ""How can you shorten the prayer when Allah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear' ,"" so Ibn `Umar said, ""O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'ahs during travel."" (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via ‘Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.)
The verse expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically restricting the distance . Thus the Quran and sunnah mention ""travel"" and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particular case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (regarding the minimum required distance).

and of itself must meet the distance required to be considered travel (88.7 km plus or minus), even if 
he is returning to get something he forgot and plans to return to his original travel plans. This is

                When one leaves his/her home town traveling without a specific destination until reaching 
the distance limit for shortening the prayer (e.g. a shepherd looking for good grazing for 
his sheep, a picnicker searching for a more suitable place for camping, or one chasing a 
fugitive) is he/she allowed to shorten prayers?",,"Praise be to Allah.According to the majority (of Muslim scholars) one would not be allowed to shorten prayers, since 
the traveler in such a case has set off without the intention beforehand (and the intention is of 
significance in Islam). Therefore he/she has not met the condition of being a traveler."
74,90,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/90,One who follows others and is unaware of the destination,"Question

                Are those who are accompanying or following others (e.g. a soldier with his commander 
or a servant with his/her sponsor/boss) and are fully unaware of the destination permitted 
to take advantage of the license to shorten the prayers?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the people in question know beforehand that those whom they are following had the intention to 
travel, then they would be permitted to shorten. On the other hand, if they were fully unaware of the 
intentions of those whom they were following, they would be allowed to shorten prayers once they 
themselves set-off with the intention to travel apart from their companions. This ruling is the Hanbali 
and Hanafi opinion."
75,91,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/91,At what point is a traveler permitted to commence shortening the prayers,"Question

                At what point is a traveler permitted to commence shortening prayers?",,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of the Muslim scholars assert the condition that a traveler must depart from all the 
housings and buildings of his/her home town relying on the fact that Allaah (glory be to Him) relates 
shortening to travel (specifically darb fil-ardh), and such travel only happens once departing one's 
home-town. Moreover, the Prophet Mohammed  (peace be upon him) himself shortened at a place 
called (Dhul-Hulaiyfah) after departing from al-Madinah."
76,92,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/92,Prayer of those who are waiting to depart or just arriving,"Question

                What is the verdict in performing two salaat (prayers) together (jam'a) and shortening the 
prayer (qasr) at the airport for those who are waiting to fly or those who have just 
disembarked from an arriving plane?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the airport, sea-port or railway station are within the outskirts of the traveler's home-town, or even 
linked to his/her home-town by contiguous dwellings or buildings, no license to shorten prayers is 
allowed, since he/she would not be considered to have departed the dwelling or town. Once the 
plane, ship, or train has traveled away from all housing and buildings, only then is he/she allowed to 
shorten and/or perform together two prayers. If the airport, harbor, or train station is outside the 
home town, a traveler is allowed to utilize the license to shorten and combine two prayers together 
based on the fact that he or she in this case has departed from his/her city and has already 
commenced on his/her journey."
77,93,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93,Libaas ul-shuhrah and wearing extravagant clothing,"Question

                What is the ruling on libaas ul-shuhrah or the wearing of extravagant clothing?",,"Praise be to Allah.All praise and thanks be to Allaah the Lord of the worlds.
Regarding your question about the prohibition of so-called ""libaas ul-shuhrah"" (lit. dress of high repute, 
i.e. to show-off or as a status symbol), there is a sound and truthful hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn 
Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that Allah's messenger Muhammad  (peace be upon 
him) said: ""He who wears libaas ul-shuhra in this world will be dressed in humiliating clothes on the 
day of judgment."" (narrated by Ahmed & Abu Dawood, confirmed sahih by Al Albani in Sahih Al-Jami' 
6526)
Those who wear libaas ul-shuhrah will be punished on the day of judgment in accordance with their 
deeds (as you sow, so you reap), provided that he/she meant sovereignty and supremacy upon mankind. 
In return, Allaah Almighty will humiliate him/her on the day of judgment and will suppress him/her to 
put-on such a dress for which people would despise him/her and mock at him/her (as you sow, so you 
reap). 
The question here is: "" What consists libaas ul-shurah?"" What is meant by this expression is a anything 
worn to show-off and to attract the attentions of others, so as to look upwards unto him/her once he/she 
appears wearing it. This, of course is due either to its strange colors amongst the ordinary dresses of 
other people or due to the stylish models or even to how precious, expensive or even to the contrary of 
this as being trivial and completely valueless.
Hence, our righteous forefathers (may Allaah have mercy upon their souls) used to hate, disregard and 
even despise either extremity of the fame-clothing: i.e. those which are highly bombastic & precious 
and/or vise versa alike.
All we wish of His All-Mighty is to grant us the righteous clothing and save us in this world and in the 
hereafter. Aameen."

I fall into sin and then repent. But my base self overcomes me and I fall into it again. Does this nullify my earlier repentance leaving the previous sins intact and not forgiven?",,"Praise be to Allah.In the opinion of the majority of scholars it is not a condition for a repentance to be accepted that the penitent does not fall into the same sin again. It is a condition that the sin be given up immediately and that there should be true feelings of regret in the heart. This should be accompanied by the firm intention not to fall into it again. Now, with these conditions met, if he falls into it again, then this will be considered a new sin altogether, requiring a new repentance and with no connection to those of the past.
And Allah knows best."
79,95,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/95,Repentance for Neglecting Acts of Worship,"Question

I have neglected many rights of Allah in the past, such as prayers, fasts, and zakah (paying poor-due). Am I required to repeat them or to compensate for them?",,"Praise be to Allah.As far as the five daily prayers are concerned, the preferred opinion is that the repetition or compensation (or what is known as qadha in Arabic), is not obligatory for the reason that prayers are obligatory at a particular time, and once that time has elapsed, there is no way to offer them. However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible.
As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less.
Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation.
Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting.
It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting.
As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right. (See Madarij Al-Salikin for further details).
And Allah knows best."
80,96,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/96,Repentance from One Type of Sin While Committing Another,"Question

Is repentance from a particular sin acceptable while I am a victim of another?",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, repentance from a particular sin is acceptable even if the repentant insists on another sin which is of a different nature and not the same as the one from which he has repented. For example, if a man repents from having accepted interest but not from drinking wine, his repentance over accepting interest is acceptable, and vice versa. But if he repents from simple interest but not compound interest then his repentance is invalid. Or if he repents from taking drugs but insists on drinking wine, or vice versa, then the repentance is invalid too. It will also be incorrect and unacceptable if a man repents from adultery with one woman but commits it with another. In all of these cases they have only shifted from one variety of sin to another within the same kind.
And Allah knows best."
81,98,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98,Returning stolen money when owner not reachable,"Question

                I stole from certain people. Now I have repented, but I do not know where 
they live. Perhaps another may say,"" I embezzled some money from a firm 
which has closed up its business."" Or yet another person may say,"" I 
pilfered some material from an establishment which has shifted its 
premises."" What shall I do now?",,"Praise be to Allah.In all these cases it is incumbent upon you to search for them to the extent of your 
means. If you find them, return them their right. If the owner or owners have died, then 
their right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate 
them, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the 
reward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some 
way or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the 
Hereafter. 
This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin 
(1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from 
al-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him 
what he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander 
refused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that 
they have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking 
his advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each 
soldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is 
one-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic 
government which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth 
of all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give 
convey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan 
[who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is 
dearer to me than half of what I rule over.' Imam Ibn Taymiyya has also given a similar 
ruling. (See Madarij)"
82,99,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/99,Repentance From Backbiting and Informing Victim,"Question

                I have committed backbiting involving a person or a group of people, or have unjustly slandered some people regarding things with which they didn't have anything to do. Is it a condition of repentance that I should inform them and seek their pardon? And if this is not required then how do I repent?",,"Praise be to Allah.The answer will depend on 
    the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that 
    if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not 
    be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their 
    forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering 
    details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments 
    about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and 
    seeks their forgiveness. 
But if the case is the 
    opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous 
    backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to 
    happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, 
    rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them 
    to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know 
    and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order 
    adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of 
    things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against 
    the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and 
    brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity 
    where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the 
    following manner. 

    Evoke 
    in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah 
    accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing 
    in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier 
    before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged 
    were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by 
    mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the 
    presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend 
    the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to 
    Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had 
    wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for 
    further elucidation). 
You must note, dear 
    brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the 
    material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting 
    and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they 
    are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must 
    not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those 
    concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause 
    increase in distress.

    And Allah knows best."
83,100,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/100,Repentance from Sins Involving the Rights of Others,"Question

If the sin involves the rights of another person then what form should repentance take?",,"Praise be to Allah.The basis for the answer is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: ""He upon whom his brother has a right, be it of the nature of money or honor, let him compensate for it before he is made to compensate for it on a day when there will be neither dinar nor dirham to deal with. Instead, if he has a good deed in his account it will be taken away from him and given to the person he had wronged. And if he has no good deeds in his account, sins of the other person will be taken from him and added to his account"" (al-Bukhari). Accordingly, the repentant can escape the questioning only by either giving back to the people wronged their due or seeking their forgiveness. If they forgive, he need not worry, but if they do not, then he must return their dues.
And Allah knows best."

nisaab","Question

                Should the Zakat be paid from the WHOLE money you 
have (if more than elnisab) or from the amount you have 
beyond elnisab (the remains from subtracting the nisab 
from the whole money) ?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). 
  Al-Khiraqi (rahimahullah) said: ""If it (nisaab al-zakaat) is reached then 
  a quarter of 1/10 is due upon it and upon whatever exceeds it, no matter how 
  small."" Ibn Qadama (rahimahullah) in explaining this statement said: ""Meaning 
  that if the amount of silver has reached 200 (which is the nisaab of silver 
  in dirhams as has been discussed in question # 
  64) and 
  the dinars 20 (which is the nisaab for gold in the units of mathaqeel [ 
  see also question #64]) 
  then one is obligated to pay zakaat upon it one quarter of 10 percent, as this 
  has been established by his (the Prophet's  , peace 
  be upon him) saying 'for silver, one fourth of one tenth' "" (Al-Mughni 
  ma'a al-sharh il-kabeer, 2/600)
As for the meaning of the rest of the statement 
  that what exceeds the nisaab no matter how small, it means that 1/4 of 1/10 
  (i.e. 2.5%) is also due upon this surplus difference. Thus, the overall meaning 
  is that if monetary wealth surpasses the amount of nisaab, then zakaat is due 
  upon it all, and not upon the surplus only, nor upon the amount of nisaab only, 
  but on the total. Note that zakaat must be paid on the excess amount over nisaab, 
  regardless of how small. This is the opinion taken by Malik and al-Shaafi'i 
  and jumhoor al-ulemaa'. (see the source quoted above)"

                I have read several articles on what foods are halal and what foods are haraam. But when I 
go to a restaurant I still [doubt] if what I am eating is halal. I know that the meat needs to be 
slaughtered in the name of Allah, and it shall be done by the people of the book. Currently 
in the United States, the Christians and the Jews don't follow the true Bible and the Torah. 
The Christians call Isa (may Allah be pleased with him) the son of God. Is the meat cut by 
these people halal, can it be eaten?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah).al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). The Christians and the Jews of 
the People of the Book in our times are indeed those People of the Book that are mentioned in the texts 
of shari'ah in the Qur'an and sunnah, and they are the kuffar (unbelievers) of the Jews and Christians that 
existed at the time of the Prophet  (peace be upon him). They are the people of the corrupted Torah 
and corrputed Injeel, as evidenced by the fact that Allah (swt) addressed them and named them ""People 
of the Book"" despite their being kuffar and their books being corrupted, as indicated in the following 
interpretations of the meanings of the aayaat:
Aala 'imran: 70:
O People of the Book! why do you reject the Signs of Allah, of which you are (yourselves) witnesses?
Al-maa'ida: 15:
O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to 
hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from 
Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book.
Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer):
It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first 
gathering (of the forces)
These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from 
the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of 
previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar 
who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the 
communists, and others.
Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of 
the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste 
and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating 
their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
Maa'ida: 5
This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is 
lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste 
women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your 
time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues
The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the 
People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of 
several cases:
That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon 
it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it.

That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or 
electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case 
there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without 
properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): 
"" and forbidden unto you is maita"" (al-Maa'ida:3)

That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, 
such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, 
since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the 
ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): ""Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, 
blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that 
which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow""

That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this 
case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is 
permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh 
Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) 
""and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you."" 
(al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would 
not be permisible.

That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case 
likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith 
in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the 
Prophet  (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know 
whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet  replied ""Mention 
the name of Allah upon it and eat it."""
86,105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105,Ruling on Cousin Marriage in Islam,"Question

Is it correct that our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) discouraged marrying cousins? Should marrying cousins be the last resort?","There is nothing wrong with marriage to cousins in Islam, as cousins are not included in the maharim.","Praise be to Allah.Can you marry your cousin?
There is no objection whatsoever in the Islamic religion for a man to marry any of his relatives except al-maharim (those forbidden for marriage ) whom Allah mentioned in Surat Al-Nisa, 4:23 (interpretation of the meaning):
“Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (who breast-fed you), foster-sisters (who breast-fed from the same woman as you); your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives with whom you have consummated marriage, no prohibition if ye have not consummated; (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
Thus, when Allah mentioned for us the relatives to whom marriage is forbidden, we then come to know that there is no objection for the remainder of the family relations. 
Should marrying cousins be the last resort?
Furthermore, there is no condition that it be the last resort as indicated in the question. Among the most prominent evidence of this fact is that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married his daughter Fatimah to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) and he is the son of her father's uncle, as well as the marriage of the Prophet himself to Zainab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) and she is his aunt's daughter (i.e. his cousin); and there are many other such examples.
However, a different question may be asked, namely: ""Is it better or preferable for a Muslim to marry someone he is not related to rather than a relative?""
The answer to this question varies from case to case, and perhaps it may be preferable to marry people who are non-relations, for example if one aspires to form new social ties or bonds, and regards the existence of a marriage relationship with a different family as constructive in widening the circle of social bonds.

88,110,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/110,Ruling on smoking,"Question

Is smoking cigarettes Haraam?",,"Praise be to Allah.And peace and blessings be on His Prophet.
Smoking is one of the things which has caused a lot of problems and harm these days and it has spread like wild fire. Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allaah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (al-tayyibaat, al-halaal) and evil or prohibited (al-khabaa'ith, al-haraam), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) in surat al-A'raaf (7:157):
""And He makes good things halaal for them and bad things haraam.""
Considering this fact, smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil.
Thus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking.

There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being. Allah said (interpretation of meaning):
	""Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you."" (Surat al-Nisaa' 4:29)
In addition, His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:
""There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islaam)."" (Arabic ""laa darar wa laa diraar"")
He (peace and blessings be upon him) also said:
""A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ... his body as to what he engaged it in.""
Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him):
""Your body has a right on you.""

There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for the health of others who inhale the polluted breath of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children.
The offensive smell caused by smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of Allah among humans and angels. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
	""Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin."" (Surat al-Ahzaab, 33:58)

The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
	""… and do not be extravagant wasters. Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan."" (Surat al-Israa' 17:26-27)
Extravagance (in Islam) means spending on something haraam.
Spending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:
""A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ..... what he owned as to how he spent it.""


Considering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others. It is not permissible to indulge in it, or buy and sell it, or even to offer it to others. It is incumbent on a person who is addicted to it that he must make all efforts and get whatever necessary treatment to stop it. If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it.
We ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up. Allah is the Best Guide to the Right Path."

I commend and appreciate your wise and mature sense of judgment in supporting your friend's decision to accept Islam. It shows admirable wisdom and a balanced sense of sagacity and understanding of this blessed event.
How to embrace Islam
Regarding the procedure for embracing the religion of Islam, it is actually an extremely simple process, without complication or prolongment. This is because it is something between a person and his Lord and there are no other parties involved. 
All that is required of a person in order to embrace Islam is that he or she pronounces the two testaments of belief in the Islamic creed, believing in their meaning, then to take a complete bath with the intention of (ritual) purification in order to start performing prayers (note to ensure complete cleanliness one should shave pubic and under-arm hair, and a man should be circumcized if he is not already--Islam places great emphasis on proper hygiene and personal cleanliness).
The meaning of the shahadah
As for the two testimonies of creed, the first is ""ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah"" (I testify that there is no deity other than Allah), which means that one believes and confirms that there is nothing to be worshipped other than Allah and that one is prepared to implement His divine rulings and guidelines (Shari`ah) for all aspects of life. 
The second is ""ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasool ullah"" which means the belief that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the seal of the prophets (i.e. the final one), whom Allah has sent with the Islamic religion to supercede all other previous religions and that it is obligatory to comply with what he has enjoined, and to abstain and renounce all that he has prohibited and restrained.
Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late
I tend to gather from your question that there is a degree of pondering on your part or inclination towards embracing the Islamic religion, joining the example of your friend. I would invite you to carry through with it without excessive delay and reluctance , for one does not know when one's fate will come. 
So why not meet one's unavoidable fate as a believer in Allah (God) and the Hereafter, a member of the religion of Islam? It is the religion which Allah has specified that He will not accept any other religion besides it, and He will not save anyone from Hell besides its followers. Undoubtedly, this step will be the greatest thing that you will ever have experienced in your life. Surely you will not regret it at all and Allah will help you to surmount the difficulties you perhaps may face in your path after accepting Islam, such as the scorn of some relatives or family members or the alientation of some friends. However, the step in fulfilling your destiny is much more important and significant than all this.
We pray for you to be bestowed with grace, and may Allah guide you to success.
Waiting for glad tidings in the near future, may Allah guard and protect you.

Is dating haram in Islam?
I was extremely pleased to receive your questions regarding the nature of the relationship between men and women in Islam.
Regarding the issue of dating in Islam , one must first define what is meant by ""dating."" If dating is understood to mean how a man and a woman get to know each other for the purpose of marriage, then there are certain guidelines and established procedures which can be discussed. 
However, if dating is understood to refer to casual relationships between men and women for the purpose of ""fun"" or ""going out"" and such, then there is no provision for this in Islam. 
Such a situation is not considered respectful for either the man or the woman, nor is it constructive for the concept or the building of the family or society or social responsibility. Opening the door to relationships of love and infatuation and passion and pre-marital sex is categorically prohibited in Islam. It does not lead to the establishment of a family nor to proper and virtuous upbringing of children nor to stability and mutual care and tranquility and peace of mind between a man and woman.
Rather, dating leads to disorder, the disgracing of one's honor and dignity, and to a lifestyle similar to that of animals, and to that of illegitimate children who are subjected to a life of vagrancy and loss. (Please see question # 61 which addresses the issue of prohibition of pre-marital relationships).
How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam
As for the former case, regarding how a man and a woman come to know each other for the purpose of marriage , it varies from circumstance to circumstance. Normally if a man has the desire to marry and has the ability to accept the responsibility, and he does not have anyone in mind, he will ask his friends, family, and relatives if there is a lady that may be suitable for him and his expectations among their acquaintances and relatives. 
If someone is suggested, he normally asks about her extensively, about her religious observance, her personality, her knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, suitability as a wife willing to accept all the relevant responsibilities, etc. 
If preliminary information seems appealing, then normally she is told that there is someone interested in meeting her and she is likewise given relevant information about him.
At this point, assuming the man and the woman as well as both families involved agree that there is potential, then the man usually visits the woman's family, often accompanied by members of his own. They are given the opportunity to see each other and sit and talk together, to converse modestly (but not in complete solitude) regarding whatever is relevant to making an informed judgment. 
The intention for this meeting should be for them to be able to make a decision whether or not they feel they are mutually suitable. Afterwards, they each evaluate their own and their families' reactions, and pray to Allah that He guides them to what is in their best interest, and to make them accept the outcome. 
When both sides feel comfortable and feel they know everything they need to, based on all that has been mentioned such as asking about the other person, knowing their family, meeting in person, etc., they can make a final decision whether to carry on with marriage or not.
And Allah knows best."

                Can a non-muslim man marry a muslim woman?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is absolutely not permissible under any circumstances in Islamic law (shari'a) of Allah, 
the most esteemed and exhalted, for a non-Muslim to marry a Muslim woman, as per 
what He has said regarding the marriage of a kafir (unbeliever) to a Muslim woman and 
vice versa: (interpretation of the meaning).
They are not lawful (wives) for the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful 
(husbands) for them... (Al-Mumtahina:10)
And Allah the most esteemed and exhalted has also said (interpretation of the meaning):
Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe... (Al-Baqara:221)
i.e., it is not ever permissable for someone to marry his Muslim daughter or sister or any 
Muslim woman for whom he is a guardian to a kafir.
Islam must be exhalted and cannot be subjugated, so how could a Muslim woman be 
put under the care of a kafir man, when the man is normally naturally in a stronger 
position? In such a situation he could cause her to corrupt the practice of her religion or 
force her into subdual by causing her to live a life of oppression with him. He could also 
prevent her from practicing some of her religious rites. These are among the reasons for 
the aforementioned ban expressed in the previous ayaat. wallahu a'lam (and Allah is the

man? If he refuses to become a Muslim, can she continue to live with him?",,"Praise be to Allah.All praise be to Allah the Almighty.
If a woman becomes a Muslima and her husband is a kaafir, then it becomes mandatory for her to 
separate from him and it is not permissible for her to remain with him in his state of shirk (disbelief), 
as per Allah's injunction (interpretation of the meaning):
"" do not send them back to the disbelieversthey are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor 
are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them"" (Al-Mumtahinah 60:10).
It is her duty to invite him to Islam and to attempt to convince him via various approaches in the hope 
that Allah may accept her efforts and give her the great reward for his guidance through her. The 
prophet   (peace be upon him) once told Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when he sent him to a 
people who were idol-worshippers:
""Invite them to Islam and inform them what is required of them, for (I swear) by Allah, that Allah 
guides a man through you is better than if you had humr un-na'am (a particular kind of camel 
which is the most sought-after wealth among the Arabs)"" (Al-Bukhari, Fath il-Baari 3009).
As for the course of the marriage, and what she should do if her husband accepts Islam or doesn't, 
Ibn ul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: What is indicated by evidence of his   (i.e., 
the prophet's) ruling is that the marriage is mawqoof, or in abeyance (i.e. suspension); if her husband 
accepts Islam before the elapsing of her 'iddah (waiting period), then she remains his wife. If her 
'iddah elapses then she has the right to marry whom she pleases or if she likes she may wait (in the 
hope he may still accept Islam). If he then accepts Islam, she becomes his wife without need of 
renewing the marriage. (Zaad ul-Ma'aad, Vol 5 p.138).

                When is the romedon holiday?

The month of Ramadhaan for this Hijrah year 1418H is expected to commence on 30 or 31 December 1997, as will be established by sighting of the moon.

""They ask you [O Muhammad 
] about the new moons. Tell them they are signs for people to mark
fixed periods of time and for the pilgrimage...""


so that they may fix their times of worship and other appointments.


The Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) also said:


""Begin fasting after sighting the moon.""


One should note in comparing and contrasting the beginning of the month of Ramadhaan for this Hijrah year with the Gregorian date at that time. We will begin the Holy month of Ramadhaan in shaa' Allaah while the Christians will be celebrating New Year and Christmas.  While we will be refraining from eating and drinking, in worship and obedience to the Lord of the worlds, they will be involved in the worst of all sins and malpractice.

93,121,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/121,Salaried imam receiving a portion of zakaat collected,"Question

Dear brother in faith.
I start with the name of Allah. I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous answer which was of a great help to our community (all thanks be to Allah). We are still have not purchased a masjid yet.  We are considering an older church, with the will of Allah, we will convert it into a masjid and a school.  Therefore, we are still collecting donations, which leads to my questions:
Our Imam has been leading the efforts in gathering the donations from local sources and out of town resources.  The Imam is on a bi-weekly salary and it is not in his contract to collect donations for the masjid.  The Imam has suggested the idea of building or purchasing a masjid, and he also suggested collecting the donations.  It has been suggested to us by one of the brothers that the Imam should get a percentage of the donations he collects according to Surah 6 Tawbah #60 ""Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds)""  
1. Is the Imam entitled to a percentage of what he collected; if so, what is the percentage. Note that no prior agreement with Imam was established.
2. If a percentage is to be paid, when should this percentage be given to the Imam.
3. If the Imam is not entitled for a percentage, is the board of trustees in the community permitted to give him a reward for his efforts from the money collected.",,"Praise be to Allah.All praises be to Allaah, Lord and Sustainer of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad   (peace be upon him)  and upon his family and companions.
Dear brothers:
As-salaamu alaikum wa-rahamat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh, I ask Allah ta'ala that this message finds you all in good health and that He brings you success in all that is good. Before answering your most recent question, the following point must be made clear: Performing the duties of a mufti, a judge, an imam, a khateeb, or a mu'adhin is considered a duty of shari'ah, associated with the Hereafter, which must be rooted in one's volunteering and seeking the reward from Allah.  It is not a worldly employment for profit or attaining income, and thus one cannot apply the principle of identifying a remuneration or compensation for specifically defined duties as one would do in the case of a worldly employment contract. If one cannot find those who are willing to volunteer to fill these duties without compensation, then it is permissible to arrange a payment for he who will execute these tasks and free himself up for them, since his duties as an imam or judge or mufti or similar functions may occupy his time such that he may not find the opportunity to gain his income through other means.  Note that this payment is appointed for him for the purpose of freeing him up for his duties vis-a-vis shari'ah, and it is NOT a ""fee for hire"", i.e. NOT a salary compensating for work done.  Thus, the correct case is that he accepts money so that he can be free to make fataawa (for a mufti), NOT that he makes fataawa so that he can make money; likewise, he accepts money so that he can be free to be an imam, NOT that he works as an imam so as to make money, etc.  Both the correct and invalid cases are a means to an end; what makes one correct and the other invalid is what comprises the means and what comprises the end. The accepting of money must be the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and conduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this.  Acts of worship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which he is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project.  This suggestion is based on the fact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah regarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds.  This category must be identified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is:  those officials appointed by the khalifah of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, guarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it.  Among the prerequisites required of those who collect zakaat are:  that they are Muslim; that they are respected and trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not inclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the required Islamic fiqh, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able to perform the duties. It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a salary from bait ul-maal from other funds.  However, the official cannot take anything from the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any gifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic ahaadeeth. If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the khalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it becomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute it to those who deserve it.  Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given us a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the Islamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim countries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion of it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to administer it. Important observation: If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from bait ul-maal such as a judge (qaadi), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from the zakaat because he already has an income taken from bait ul-maal.  In addition, the duties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims (see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol 6, p.188). If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being among the poor (al-fuqaraa'), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet his needs.  Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not to compromise his impartiality and sincerity. And Allah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is best most correct."

                Assalamu'alaikum. I am very in love with my girlfriend, a Chinese non-muslim.We've 
been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest 
in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-muslim.I have 
tried to convert them to the islamic faith but they refused to submit to islam.As a muslim, 
i respect their decision but will i be doing a sin if they continued to livewith my girlfriend 
and I after we wed.I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion 
as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not 
keep idols and dieties in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any 
other chinese) What am i supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and 
she has submitted to islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her 
parents want her to keep her original name(ie Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?",,"Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah.
First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided 
  this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic 
  law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. 
  Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular 
  aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your 
  part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend 
  and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless 
  of the extent of that friendship.
Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling 
  on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for 
  the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent 
  relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) 
""not committing fornication, nor taking them as 
  lovers (i.e. girlfriends)"" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) 
So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret 
  what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, 
  and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that 
  sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion 
  of this issue in question #61) 
As for your statement: ""I deeply love my girlfriend's parents 
  even though they rejected our religion,"" by Allah it is extremely astonishing 
  how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who 
  are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid 
  what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse 
  the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement 
  in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): 
  
""You will not find any people who believe in Allah and 
  the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His 
  Messenger (Muhammad- 
  Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or 
  their sons or their kindred"" 
We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; 
  however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their 
  denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion 
  that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to 
  treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to 
  be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. 
  You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider 
  them carefully.
Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with 
  you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., 
  eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.)
As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding 
  changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden 
  meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means 
  worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worship per of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) 
  then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissable and 
  not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or 
  a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to 
  change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the 
  person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family 
  and acquaintances.
Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful 
  and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) 
  and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah."
95,126,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126,"Conditions for performing forbidden act under necessity and engaging in 
riba transactions","Question

                Here in Singapore, the Muslims have very little, if not any, chance to participate in 
non-interest based transactions. What advice can you give to us who have no choice but 
to be involved in these transactions for our basic needs?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah: 
Every Muslim has to implement Islamic law, with all possible means, in all affairs, being social, 
economical, etc., in accordance with the verse: (interpretation of the meaning) ""Say: My prayer, my 
sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah"". 
On certain occasions Muslims may be ruled by a non-Islamic system, which makes it very difficult 
for them to practice their religion. Their example may be similar to that predicted by the prophet,  (peace be upon him):
"" There will come a day where a Muslim holding fast to his deen (religion) is like he who is 
gripping a hot coal"" (Al-Tirmidhi, sahih). 
When a Muslim is faced with such a situation, he should hold fast to the teachings of the Qur'an, 
keep himself within a good Muslim community, and strive his best to implement Islam, asking Allah's 
forgiveness for things he could not implement. Allah, the Merciful, has stated that (interpretation of 
the meaning): 
""Allah does not require from a soul more than what it can bear"". 
When the situation becomes too difficult and over-bearing, a Muslim enters in a state of ""adversity"" 
or ""necessity"" (al-dharoorah) where unlawful things (al-mahdhooraat) become permissible. This is a 
great rule in Islam which reflects its mercy and appreciation to its followers. However, this issue is 
very sensitive as many Muslims, out of their ignorance, mistreat this rule. For example they neglect 
the corollary which says: ""The state of necessity should be dealt with in proportion to its measure."" 
Therefore it is very important to mention the constraints and conditions under which the rule of 
necessity is applicable. Some of these are:
That the level of harm associated with the unlawful action be less than that caused by the state 
of dharoorah.
That the permissible degree or amount of the unlawful action he is allowed to commit be just 
enough to get him out of the state of dharoorah.
That there is no other alternative in facing the state of dharoorah other than committing the 
unlawful act.
That the duration of the concession be restricted to the duration of its cause.
That the dharoorah is actually existing and not only anticipated or expected. 
When someone is faced by dharoorah and all its conditions and constraints are observed then 
the unlawful thing becomes lawful to him.
Here are few practical examples to illustrate the above:
It is permissible for the Muslim to eat from the dead animal if he finds nothing halaal to eat, and 
he will die if he doesn't eat
It is permissible for a Muslim to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) when he is under a painful 
torturing that he cannot bear.
It is permissible to deposit the money at the banks to save them from being lost or stolen, 
although that is considered to be helping the banks in their haraam interest transactions.
It is permissible to enroll in car insurance (considering that most of the forms of car insurance 
are not acceptable in Islam) if he is in bad need to have a car and he is not allowed to drive one 
without insurance.
It is permissible to complain to the ""civil courts"" (although they may not be implementing the 
Islamic law) to obtain one's rights if they is no other means to do so, provided one has the 
sound belief that there is no judgment except that of Allah.
Since the question inquires about transactions in particular, it is worth noting the following:
It is never permissible to ask for riba nor to accept it under any circumstances. Such unlawful 
action is not permissible under any need.
Minimizing the risk, or having more convenience are not valid excuses to enter into unlawful 
contracts, like those involving riba.
Improving the income or promoting the profits are also not valid excuses to adopt unlawful 
ways of earning. Let's remember that a little blessed halaal earning is better than many folds of 
haraam earning.
Finally we have to say that it is the duty of Muslims everywhere to strive to find lawful alternatives to 
alleviate the state of dharoorah and save themselves from the need to adopt unlawful ways.
We ask Allah to give us of His bounties what keeps us sufficed and satisfied, and not to make us in 
need of anyone other than Him. Ameen."

Our extended family seem to de divided on the issue of women visiting graves. Some say it is perfectly okay and do so and some say it is not permitted and do not visit graves. Please let me know if it is permissible for women to visit graves.",,"Praise be to Allah.Paying visits by Muslim men to cemeteries is a practice of the sunnah, and it reminds one of his destiny so that he may strive for it. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
""I [once] had forbid you from visiting graves, [and I now enjoin] you to do so, so that the visit may serve as a beneficial reminder."" (related by Muslim and others)
and in the version of al-Haakim:
"" for [such visits] soften the heart, bring tears to the eyes, and serve as a reminder of the Hereafter, [but be careful] not to speak forbidden expressions [i.e. while visiting]."" (Sahih al-Jaami' 4584)
Concerning visits to cemeteries by women, scholars have varied opinions on this issue:


it is allowed or preferred and their case is similar to that of men


it is makrooh (reprehensible), which is the opinion of jumhoor ul-'ulemaa' (the majority of the scholars)


it is forbidden, this one probably being the strongest opinion, as indicated by al-hadith al-sahih in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:


""Allah has cursed women who frequent graves,"" related by Ahmed and Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah and in one version,
""Allah has cursed women who visit graves and those who build mosques and place lights upon them."" (related by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa'i and al-Haakim)
This condemnation would warrant the validity of the argument against women visiting cemeteries as the lawmaker (i.e. Allah) would not condemn something that is permissible or reprehensibleonly that which is forbidden completely.
Regarding what would be the reason for this condemnation, the scholars have cited two main arguments:


Firstly, that women for the most part are emotionally weaker in accepting calamities and perhaps being in sight of her dear one's graves may break into wailing and loud weeping, which would be detrimental to her religious character and harmful for her body as well.


Secondly, cemeteries are oftentimes isolated places which may not be safe for someone being alone, possibly exposing a woman to people of corrupt or loose moral character.


In summary, the rationale behind this prohibition is that women are often not as strong emotionally in the face of calamities, and not visiting graves prevents them from the trial and from being exposed to unnecessary fitnah.

97,135,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/135,Can You Name Your Child after an Angel?,"Question

By Allah's mercy, many Muslims are entering Islam in America. Many Muslims change their names after accepting Islam. Some change their names to names of angels like Jibril or Mikail, etc. According to the 'aqidah of Ahl-us-Sunnah, angels are neither male nor female. If one says they are male, this is bid`ah and if one says they are female, this is kufr. 
So, I would like to know in light of all of this, what is the proper status of changing one's name to the name of an angel. Is it haram, makruh, mubah, etc.? Please help me with this answer for I have been asking and I have yet to receive a response. May Allah reward you for your answer! What advice would you give someone who has changed his or her name to the name of an angel?","It is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers.","Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim said in his book ""Tuhfat al-Mawdud fi Ahkam al-Mawlud"" in the second chapter under ""What is preferred among the names and what is considered reprehensible among them"" said:
“... and among them are the names of the angels such as Jibrail and Mikail and Israfil, it is makruh to name human beings with these names. Ash'had said: Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked regarding naming someone the name Jibril; he abhorred it and it didn't please him; al-Qai `Iyad said: ""... and others allowed it."" Abdul-Razzak said in al-Jami' via Ma`mar: ""I said to Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman what would you say regarding a man whose name is Jibril or Mikail, and he responded, 'There is no objection.' (la bas bi-hi)""
Regarding the hadith: ""la tusammow bi-asma al-malaikah"" (""don't name yourselves with the names of the angels ""),  al-Bukhari has said that the validity of its chain of narration is questionable. This means that the hadith would not be considered sahih.” (""Tuhfat al-Mawdud,  p. 83)
In al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya most of the scholars have ruled that using the names of the angels like Jibril and Mikail is not makruh (disagreeable or reprehensible). Imam Malik, on the other hand, has ruled that it is makruh.” (Al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya, al-Kuwait, Vol 11:334)
Some have stated that the meaning of Jibril is Abdullah and likewise Mikail. See Tafsir Ibn Kathir under verses numbers 97-98 in Surat al-Baqarah.
Thus, based on what has been presented, it is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers. The most preferred names, no doubt, are ‘Abdullah and ‘Abdul-Rahman as has been related in the sound hadith.

98,144,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/144,"Woman travelling from a non-Muslim country without a 
mahram in order to learn Islam","Question

                Is it permissable for a Muslim woman, who does not have a 
mahram because she is an unmarried convert, to relocate to 
another country for the purposes of furthering her Islaamic 
knowledge, to live among Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaat, and seek 
a husband?",,"Praise be to Allah.
If the Muslim woman is living in a place where there are no Muslims of Ahl 
al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah with whom she could live and she is therefore 
unable to learn her religion, it is permissible for her to move to another 
place where she can live among Ahl al-Sunnah and learn her religion. 
Indeed, she should try to move, travelling with a mahram if possible. If she 
has no mahram, then she should travel in the company of others who can 
be trusted, in an airplane, for example, so that she can reach her destination 
safely. We ask Allaah to help us obey Him.
Translator's note: ""mahram"" refers to a blood-relative to whom marriage is 
permanently forbidden, such as a woman's father, brother, son, uncle, etc."

Is it permissable for the husband to move out of the home during the iddah of his wife? For what period of time is he required to maintain her after he pronounces divorce? If he abandons the home and does not maintain her, what does the Sharee'ah say about such actions?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is mandatory that a divorced woman stay in her husband's home during the period of iddah (specifically after the first and second divorce).
It is not permissible for her husband to force her out of the home.
The verse from the Quran which asserts this is al-Talaaq (65:1), (interpretation of the meaning):
""... and do not force them out of their homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in the case where they are guilty of open illegal sexual intercourse...""
The husband is also obliged to provide for her during this period of iddah, as she is still under his guardianship ('isma).
It is permissible for the woman to beautify herself for her husband during the iddah. In fact, one of the reasons for iddah is to provide a period of reflection and contemplation, so each party may consider the consequences and review the decisions and circumstances, so as to provide a chance for them to get back together.
If the husband abandons the house or forces the wife out, then the reasons for which Allah has ordained this period have been missed. Thus, it is incumbent upon the husband to beware of this, as he would be disobeying a command from Allah.
There is nothing wrong with her going out of the house for visits, etc., with his permission, just as before her divorce.
Regarding the length of the iddah, please refer to question #31 .

After a woman reaches the end of her menstruation cycle, what is the order for her before she can have relations with her husband?

Purification does not mean merely that the blood stops, but also the act of Ghusl afterwards. It is performed by washing the whole body, and it is Sunnah to wipe the area from which the blood effuses with a perfumed (Musk) cloth as indicated by the Hadith in which the Prophet ( peace be upon him ) says:

                Is it permissible for a Muslim man to wear his shirt tucked in his pants, showing the shape of his legs, buttocks, etc., especially in some countries where women are not ashamed to look at them? And when they perform prayer, shouldn't they be wearing a long shirt covering their private parts while they prostrate?",,"Praise be to Allah.The `awrah (private parts to be necessarily covered) for men includes what is between the navel and the knees as stated by the Prophet SAWS 
 (peace be upon him), so covering it is obligatory according to Islamic law. Wearing shorts that disclose the thighs or show the shape of the buttocks, does not cover the `awrah. Neither does a dress that is transparent and displays skin complexion, nor a tight dress that shows the size, shape or bends of the `awrah. All of this is prohibited (haraam) in front of people whether the women are ashamed of looking at it or not (as asked in the question). If the trousers (or pants) are wide enough and not tight, then one may tuck his shirt in it as long as it does not display his `awrah. Covering the `awrah is obligatory during the prayer and outside it. What many people do is cover their `awrah while going to prayer but are negligent of it outside the prayer. This is a clear mistake and a wrong act which happens due to lack of understanding or as a result of a misunderstanding of the matter.

Prophet  (peace be upon him) said (approximate translation of meaning is):
""If the one crossing in front of a praying person knew what sin is upon him, it would be better for him 
to wait forty than walk across."" Abu Al-Nadhr (one of the narrators of the hadith) said: I don't know 
whether he said forth days, months, or years. (Bukhari)
Imam Al-Bukhari (R) has named the chapter in which he brings the hadith as follows: Chapter on the sin 
of walking across in front of a praying person. 
When the praying person is the leader in the prayer or praying alone, and he has a sutrah( some object 
like a peice of wood) in front of him, then walking across in between him and his sutrah is not permitted. 
However, if he is praying without a sutrah, it is not permissible to walk across in between him and his 
place of prostration. For the followers (in a jamaa'ah prayer), the leader's sutrah is enough for them.

want to wear it but it's very difficult to do it in France. I'm not married (I will be next year, 
incha Allah) and I live alone, so I'm obliged to work in my country. In France, it is 
extremely difficult to find a job and wearing hijaab. I feel very bad about that, I know the 
meaning of wearing hijaab, I don't want to wear it and to take it off later. For the moment, I 
have large garments and do my best to have a correct attitude. I plan to go to Boston for 
working next year, I know there is no problem of that kind there. My problem is just in 
France and just for one year, I don't want to stay there because of the reaction of French 
people (I'm French with no Arabic origins). So my question is: Is it possible (I mean 
correct) to wear hijaab all the time except for working ? thank you very much.",,"Praise be to Allah.All praise be to Allaah, who has guided you to Islam, and we ask Allaah to give you the strength and 
courage to be steadfast in following His guidance. It is the greatest blessing He has bestowed upon you,

Him.
As for your question, wearing hijaab is a mandatory obligation which cannot be neglected. If you cannot 
find a place in France that will allow you to work while wearing hijaab, then you must strive to move to a 
country you can wear the hijaab while working, as you have indicated. It is not permissible for you to 
not wear hijaab under any circumstance. If it is possible for you to accelerate your efforts to get married 
so that you may be able to manage without working under such circumstances, this would be even better 
and preferable. We share with you your feelings, in the sense of religious brotherhood, of the hardship 
that faces our fellow sisters in France with regards to the issue of hijaab, and ask Allaah to strengthen 
you with the courage it takes to stand up to it. By no means is it easy, and it takes great will and

Can you give us an idea about the Dajjal, Al-Dabbah and Yajuj and Majuj?","Gog and Magog will emerge in huge numbers and spread mischief on earth and no one will be able to resist them. The Antichrist will spread corruption on earth and will claim divinity, calling on people to worship him. The Beast will speak to mankind and exhort them, having the ability to reason and speak","Praise be to Allah.Three major signs of the Day of Judgement 
There follows a brief description from the Quran and authentic Sunnah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Gog and Magog, the Antichrist, and the Beast which are three major signs that will precede the Hour and will come at the end of time just before the Day of Resurrection.
The Antichrist (Al-Dajjal)
The Dajjal – a man created by Allah, who will appear at the end of time because of something that makes Allah angry. He will spread corruption on earth and will claim divinity, calling on people to worship him. 
People will be tested by the extraordinary powers that Allah will grant him, such as causing rain to fall, reviving the earth with vegetation and extracting the treasures of the earth. 
The Antichrist will be a young man with a ruddy complexion, short of stature, with curly hair. He will be one-eyed; his right eye will be flat and his other eye will have a thick piece of flesh over it. Written between his eyes will be the word “Kafir” (disbeliever). Most of those who follow him will be Jews. He will meet his end at the hands of ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) who will kill him with a spear in Lod, which is in Palestine.
Gog and Magog
Yajuj and Majuj are two disbelieving tribes from among the sons of Adam. They have wide faces and small eyes. They used to spread mischief on earth, so Allah gave Dhu’l-Qarnayn the power to build a barrier to detain them. They will keep on digging at it until Allah gives them permission to come out at the end of time, after ‘Isa (peace be upon him) has killed the Dajjal. 
Gog and Magog will emerge in huge numbers and will drink up the lake of Tiberias (in Palestine). They will spread mischief on earth and no one will be able to resist them. Jesus (peace be upon him) and the believers with him will take refuge in Mount Tur until Allah destroys Yajuj and Majuj by sending worms that will eat their necks. Then Allah will send rain to wash away their bodies into the sea and cleanse the earth of their stench.
The Beast
Al-Dabbah is a great creature which Allah will cause to emerge when the people become corrupt. It will speak to mankind and exhort them, having the ability to reason and speak. It will make marks on the people’s noses which will distinguish the believers from the disbelievers. (For more, please see Ashrat al-Sa’ah by Yusuf al-Wabil or al-Qiyamah al-Kubra by ‘Umar al-Ashqar).
The responsibility of the Muslim is to believe in what was narrated from Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). How many wondrous and strange things has Allah created in this world, which speak of His might and power, may He be glorified and exalted.

Second of all, regarding the ruling on eating the meat found in non-Muslim countries, please refer to question # 103 .
Thirdly, a Muslim should be clever and sagacious in choosing the appropriate words and gentle-mannered approach to inform such a kind person of the place where one can buy ""halaal"" meat.  Since he is already spending money on the meat whether he buys Islamically-slaughtered meat or otherwise, your guiding him to the appropriate place preserves the benefits and interests from all facets, i.e.:  not refusing his gift; and achieving the permissibility of eating the meat.  In fact, it would be a wise idea even for the meat he buys for himself and his house, as it will be better and healthier.  Perhaps you could approach him with the idea as a suggestion and not as a firm requirement, explaining to him the reasons behind it both from the point of view of the Islamic shari'ah as well as health reasons.  Thus, it would not be something you are presenting as forcing your opinion upon him; rather, you would express the importance of the issue for you, while at the same time complimenting and praising him for his generosity, expressing your embarrassment for having opened the subject.  I would expect such a generous man to accept a well-mannered approach, don't you think?"

                What is the ruling on having  the word “allaah” and the word “ muhammad ” written in an interwoven fashion on the door of a mosque?",,"Praise be to Allah.Among what the Islamic shari’ah asserts is the binding and coupling of the testimony of oneness for Allah and the testimony of the calling and message of prophet Muhammad 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it.  Additionally, in a hadith the prophet 
 
(peace be upon him) teaches:

“Islam was built upon five pillars:  to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah… .”  

It represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for one’s actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shari’ah, starts at puberty) is required to believe.  It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief.  As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet 
 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  As a result, there is great danger in this.  For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity.  Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence.  In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet 
 and worshipping him with Allah.  

Therefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented.

Meaning of “Muhammad Rasul Allah”
As for the declaration, “Muhammadun Rasul Allah ,” its meaning is the assertion of the message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to believe in it and to adhere to it by speech, action and faith, and to avoid all that is against it, whether it be sayings, actions, or intentions.

It is not allowed to ally with them just as it is not permissible to ally with non-believers.  Praying behind them is not valid. It is not allowed to mix socially with them nor to reside amongst them except for the one who calls them to the truth with knowledge, and sees hope that they will accept and that their religious condition will become correct due to his efforts.  Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for him to abandon them and to join a different community in which he can work with on establishing the fundamentals of Islam and its branches and reviving the example of the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him).  If he is not able to find the proper community, he should seclude himself from all communities, even if he experiences harshness, as has been related by Huthaifa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: 

“The people used to ask the Messenger of Allah 
 (peace be upon him) about goodness.  And I used to ask him about evil from fear of falling in it.  So I said, O Messenger of Allah, we used to be in ignorance and evil but Allah gave us this goodness, so is there evil after this goodness?  He said: “Yes”.  So I said is their goodness after this evil?  He said “Yes and it has some darkness”  I said what is its darkness?  He said: “A people following an example other than my example and calling to a guidance other than my guidance; you would agree with some of what they do and disagree with some.”  So, I said is there any evil after that goodness?  He said: “Yes, callers on the doors of Jahanam  (the Hellfire); whoever answers their call to it are thrown in it.”  So, I said:  O Messenger of Allah describe them to us.  He said: “They are from amongst us and they speak with our tongues”  I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do if this happens in my time.  He said: “Adhere to the community of Muslims and their leader.”  So, I said: What if there weren’t a community of Muslims nor a leader?  He said: “Then seclude yourself from all the communities, even if you were to bite on the root of a tree until death”

113,182,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/182,Ruling on loving non-Muslims,"Question

                Assalamu'alaikum. I am very in love with my girlfriend, a Chinese non-Muslim.We've 
been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest 
in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-Muslim.I have 
tried to convert them to the Islamic faith but they refused to submit to Islam. As a 
Muslim, I respect their decision but will I be doing a sin if they continued to live with my 
girlfriend and I after we wed. I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected 
our religion as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding 
enough to not keep idols and deities in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork 
(just like any other Chinese) What am I supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork 
anymore and she has submitted to Islam willingly but she is concerned about changing 
her name as her parents want her to keep her original name(i.e. Wong Wan Pei). Can this 
be allowed?",,"Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to 
Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty 
help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow 
me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on 
your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her 
in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. 
Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is 
not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has 
forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) 
""not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)"" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) 
So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will 
not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate 
the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of 
this issue in question #61) 
As for your statement: ""I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,"" 
by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love 
people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah 
forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a 
clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the 
meaning): 
""You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and 
loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- 
 Peace and Blessings of 
Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred"" 
We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon 
you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid 
and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to 
treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so 
that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between 
these two ideas if you consider them carefully. 
Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform 
forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) 
As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the 
name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name 
that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worshipper of Jesus 
 the 
messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its 
meaning is permissible and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green 
or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if 
changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it 
suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. 
Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of 
imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is

                In America there is a mosque which
      consists of three levels or floors. The top floor is the women’s prayer hall, the
      floor beneath it is the main prayer hall, and the floor beneath that is a kind of
      basement, in which there are washrooms, a room for Islamic magazines and publications, and
      classrooms for women; there is also an extra place for women to pray.Is it permissible for menstruating women to enter this lower level?Also, there are pillars in the mosque which interrupt the rows of
      worshippers, splitting a row into two halves. Does this break the row or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the building you describe was intended as a mosque,
    and the people on the higher and lower floors can hear the voice of the Imaam, then the
    prayer of all of them is valid. In this case it is not permissible for menstruating women
    to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer in the lower level, because it is part of
    the mosque. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“I do not make the mosque permissible for menstruating women and
    those in a state of ritual impurity.” 
As for a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some
    purpose, as long as she takes care to ensure that no blood leaks, then there is nothing
    wrong with this, because Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer)… when you are
    in a state of Janaabah (i.e., when you are in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet
    taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or when passing
    through a mosque)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:43]
And it was reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) told ‘Aa’ishah to fetch his prayer rug from the mosque, and
    she said that she was menstruating. He SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    told her: “Your menstruation is not in your hand.”
But if it was not the intention of those who established this mosque
    that the lower floor was to be part of the mosque, but it was to be a storeroom or to
    serve some other purpose, as mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the
    rulings governing mosques. It is permissible for menstruating woman and those who are in a
    state of impurity to sit there. There is nothing wrong with praying there in the places
    that are pure (taahir) and are not part of the washrooms, as it is permissible to pray in
    all clean places where there is no shar’i reason not to pray. But anyone who prays
    there cannot be considered to be following the imaam who is praying on the upper floor, if
    he cannot see him or any of the people who are praying behind him, and because this is not
    a part of the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion.
With regard to the pillars which interrupt the rows, they do not
    adversely affect the prayer, but if it is possible to form the rows in front of or behind
    the pillars so that the row will not be interrupted, this is better. And Allaah is the
    source of strength."
115,185,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/185,Foretelling of the Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible,"Question

Some folowers of Islam tell me that Muhammad and Jesus were two of the great prophets .  They tell me that the reason Muhammad wasn't mentioned in the Bible was because he was born after the Bible was already written.  Well, Jesus was born after the Old Testiment was written, yet there were over 600 prophesy's in the Old Testiment about Jesus that all came true, yet there are NO prophesy's about Muhammad in the entire Bible.  How can Muhammad be like Jesus if that is true?",,"Praise be to Allah.This is one of two cases: either this man is ignorant and what he says is of no significance, or what he says is a fabrication and a lie. We Muslims know well the aayah (Qur’aanic verse) in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John, xiv 16), — he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful
[al-A’raaf 7:157] 
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse:
“ ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)’ – this is a description of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the books of the Prophets who gave their nations the glad tidings of his coming and commanded them to follow him. This description is still there in their books and their scholars and rabbis know it. Imaam Ahmad narrated: Ismaa’eel told us from al-Jareeri from Abu Sakhr al-‘Aqeeli, a man from among the Bedouin told me, I brought a milch-camel to Madeenah during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I had sold her, I said, “Let me meet this man [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] and listen to him.” I met him walking between Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and I followed them until they came to a Jewish man who was reading from a scroll of the Torah, consoling himself for the plight of his son who lay dying, a boy who was very handsome and good looking. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘I ask you by the One Who revealed this Torah, do you find any mention in this book of yours of my attributes and my coming?’ The man gestured with his head to indicate ‘No’. But his son said, ‘Yes indeed, by the One who revealed the Torah, we do find mention of your attributes and your coming in our book, and I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that you are the Messenger of Allaah.’ [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, ‘Keep this Jew away from your brother.’ Then he took care of shrouding him and praying [the funeral prayer] over him.” This is a qawiy jayyid hadeeth.
 It was narrated that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “I met ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr and said, ‘Tell me about the attributes of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described in the Torah.’ He said, ‘Yes, by Allaah he is described in the Torah as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; you are not harsh and aggressive; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’”  ‘Ataa’ said: “Then I met Ka’b (who was one of the People of the Book who had become Muslim) and I asked him about that, and he told me exactly the same, not even one letter was different…” 
Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “ I met ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said, ‘Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Torah. He said, ‘‘Yes, by Allaah, he is described in the Torah in some of the same terms as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger;  your name is al-Mutawakkil; he is not harsh and aggressive, and he does not make a noise in the market-place; he does not repay evil with evil, rather he overlooks and forgives; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’”
(al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2125)
 Allaah did not send any Prophet without taking from him the covenant and promise that if the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were to appear during his lifetime, he would follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
 Allaah says in Soorat Aal ‘Imraan (which no Christian reads with an open mind but he will become Muslim) (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:81] 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse:
It is said that Allaah took the covenant from the Prophets that they would confirm one another, and He commanded them to believe in one another. This is the meaning of believing and helping (‘you must, then, believe in him and help him’)… Taawoos said: Allaah took the covenant from the first Prophets that they would believe in the Message of the later Prophets…
The Messenger here is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the view of ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them).
Allaah took the covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if they met him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from their nations.
If you want to know more about the references to the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible (even after it has been altered!) we refer you to the books “Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible” and “What the Bible says about Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)” by Ahmad Deedat.
We ask Allaah to guide you."

                A sister's husband became addicted to crack cocaine, and he beat her badly, threw a knife at her and tried to kill her, and abandoned her for four months. She requested a khula from the Imaam of the community and even though everyone could see how badly she was beaten (scars, bruises) and that her husband was no longer home, the Imaam refused to nullify the contract unless the wife drew up a written summary on paper of why she wanted a khula, which as she puts it ""is long as a book."" She refused to write it, and she did not get divorced. And as the weeks passed, it became apparent that the Imaam (who is a part of the bid'ah of giving bay'ah) was incompetant and handled the situation badly. Her husband rehabbed himself, and came home, and she accepted him back, and months later, his addiction came up again and he left weeks ago. She now wants a khula again, but she does not know what to do.  Please Advice.",,"Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds.
If what is described in the question is true, then it is a lesson and a warning about how sin can destroy homes and families. Every Muslim must repent to Allaah and give up sin and disobedience.
It is very strange that this sister does not want to write down her reasons for asking for divorce. She should respond to this request what harm could it possibly do?
If the influential person who is responsible for the affairs of the Muslim community in that place sees that there is no possibility of reconciling the two partners and continuing the marriage, he should issue a divorce (khula divorce instigated by the woman) freeing her from the husband, on conditions that are mutually acceptable.
We ask Allaah to protect our families and the families of all Muslims from fitnah (temptation, tribulation), and to rectify all our affairs."
117,205,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/205,"There is no such thing as bid’ah hasanah in
Islam","Question

                Bismillahir rahmaanir raheem,
  As salaamu 'alaykum,
  I have read a number of refutations written by the ash'areeyah/soofiyah regarding the
  concept ""bid'ah hasanah"" - they justify this concept by the narration in
  Bukhaaree's saheeh when the sahabi said ""Rabbanaa lakal hamd hamdan katheeran
  tayyiban mubaarakan fih"" when coming out of rukoo' and rasulullah (
) approved.
  They say Ibn Hajr was of this opinion and supported this view. Also they quote Ibn Hajr as
  condemning Ibn Taymiyyah as ""a slave who is leading others astray."" Any comments
  on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be
upon his truthful Prophet. 
Firstly, how can there be any such thing as bidah hasanah
(good innovation) when the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
him) said: Every bidah is a going astray and every going astray is in
Hell-fire.  So, if anyone says that there is such a thing as bidah
hasanah, he can only be insisting on going against the Messenger of Allaah 
(peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him).
Secondly, saying al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to
Allaah) when coming out of rukoo is a well-known phrase of dhikr which is
proven in sound ahaadeeth reported from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
upon him). All that this Sahaabi did was to come up with a new phrase expressing praise to
Allaah. How can this be used as evidence to support innovations in worship and dhikr that
have no basis in the sources of Islam?
Thirdly, what this Sahaabi did cannot be taken as evidence in and of itself. It was not even considered to have been a correct action until after the Prophet   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had approved it, and not before. But how on earth could this innovator obtain the approval of the Prophet 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he has passed away?""
Fourthly, if we accept the use of this report as evidence, it is still no more than an
isolated incident which cannot be generalized, whereas the hadeeth every bidah
is a going astray is clearly a general statement. It is a well-known principle among
the ulamaa (scholars) that what is stated clearly takes precedence over what
is merely implied.
Fifthly, how can we know what is good or not with our limited minds alone and without
the input of Revelation? Is there not the possibility of differences of opinion? What one
person sees as good will be seen differently by another, so what would the standard be?
Whose reasoning could we rely on or refer to? Would this not be confusion, even anarchy
itself?
Sixthly (which confirms the third point made above), when the Prophet 
 (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of an act of worship or a dhikr (remembrance of
Allaah) on the part of one of his Sahaabah, it would thus become a part of shareeah
and hence be regarded as a sunnah hasanah. But with the death of the Prophet 
 (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the ceasing of Revelation, how can we know
whether innovated acts of worship or dhikr are correct or would be approved? We have no
way of knowing, so we should limit ourselves only to the forms of worship that have been
narrated in sound reports.
The great scholar al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated many
comments by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Fath al-Baari; he agreed with some and
disagreed with others. This is the business of the scholars: they discuss and debate with
one another, with the aim of reaching the truth  which may lie with the one who is
disagreeing or with the one whose opinion is being criticized. As for the unpleasant
comment quoted in the question, from what we know of Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on
him) and his good manners, fear of Allaah, awareness of the value of knowledge and respect
for the scholars, we are sure that this comment is a fabrication. May Allaah forgive all
the scholars and reward them for their efforts and concern."
118,206,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/206,Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah,"Question

Can you tell me the characteristics of jama’ah Islam that we must follow?","Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are: 1- they follow the truth, 2- they obey the commandments of Allah, 3- they will be victorious until the Last Hour, and 4- they are patient and resist others with patience.","Praise be to Allah.It is the Muslim’s duty to follow the truth and to join the victorious group, the people of Sunnah and Jama`ah (Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah ) who are followers of the pious predecessors (al-salaf al-salih ), loving them for the sake of Allah whether they are in his own country or elsewhere, and cooperating with them in righteousness.
The attributes of the victorious group 
The attributes of the victorious group are related in a number of sahih hadiths, for example:

The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “My ummah is an ummah which carries out the commands of Allah; those who let them down or differ from them do not harm them and they will keep adhering to this path until the Day of Judgement.”
Mu‘awiyah and ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ‘A group of my ummah will continue victoriously adhering to the truth until the Last Hour begins.’”
Al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: “Some people of my ummah will remain victorious over the people until the decree of Allah reaches them.”
‘Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will continue fighting for the truth, and will prevail over those who oppose them, until the last of them will kill al-Masih al-Dajjal (the Liar or Anti-Christ).”

From these hadiths we may understand the following:

The Prophet’s words “A group of my ummah will continue . . .” indicate that this is a section of the ummah, not the entire ummah. This also indicates that there will be other groups and sects.
His words “those who oppose them will not harm them” indicate that there will be other groups who oppose the victorious group in the way they practice the religion. This also concurs with the Hadith which describes the ummah being divided into seventy-two groups or sects who oppose the one group that is following the truth.
Both hadiths offer glad tidings to the people who are following the truth. The Hadith that speaks of the victorious group speaks of their victory in this world.
The words “until the decree of Allah reaches them” refer to the wind or breeze that will come and take the soul of every believing man and woman. This does not contradict the Hadith “A group of my ummah will remain victoriously supporting the truth until the Day of Resurrection,” because that Hadith means that they will continue to follow the truth until that gentle breeze takes their souls just before the Day of Resurrection, when many other Signs of the Last Hour have already manifested themselves.

 Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah
From the hadiths quoted above, and other reports, we can derive the following characteristics of the victorious group :

They follow the truth. They are described variously as “following the truth,” “following the commandments of Allah,” “following the true religion,” etc.

All of these phrases indicate that they are adhering to the true religion with which Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) was sent.

They obey the commandments of Allah, which means:


They are distinguished from the rest of mankind by carrying the banner of Da`wah towards Allah.
They undertake the mission of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.


They will be victorious until the Last Hour.

The hadiths say that “they will be victorious until the decree of Allah comes,” “they victoriously support the truth,” or “they will be victorious over those who oppose them.”
This victory includes:

Being open and not hiding: they are well-known and prominent and have the upper hand.
Adherence to true religion, righteousness, following Allah’s commands and fighting against His enemies in jihad
Victory by defeating others


They are patient and resist others with patience.

Abu Tha‘labah al-Khashani (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “After you there will come days of patience, in which the patience required will be like having to hold a burning coal in one’s hand.”
Who are the people of the victorious sect?
Al-Bukhari said: “They are the people of knowledge (the scholars).”
Many scholars said that the victorious group is the scholars of Hadith .
Al-Nawawi said: “It is possible that this group is scattered among all types of believers. Some may be brave fighters, or jurists, or scholars of Hadith, or ascetics, or people who enjoin good and forbid evil, and other types of good people.”
Al-Nawawi also said: “It could be a group of different types of believers, including those who are brave and skilled in warfare, faqihs, scholars of Hadith, Quranic commentators (mufassirin), those who enjoin good and forbid evil, ascetics and devoted worshippers.”
Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, explained the matter as follows: “They do not have to all be in one city; they could be gathered in one country or dispersed across the world. They may be gathered in one city or in a part of it. It is possible that one group may exist, then disappear, then be replaced by another group, and so on, until the Day of Judgement, when all will disappear except for one group in one city, who will disappear when the breeze decreed by Allah comes.”
The scholars’ discussion of this group does not specify one type of people, or one city or country, except for the last group, which will be in al-Sham (the territory comprising modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine) and will fight the Dajjal, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said.
No doubt those who are involved with the sciences of Shari`ah – `aqidah, fiqh, Hadith and tafsir, studying and teaching – are the people who are most qualified to be called the Victorious Group, and they should be at the forefront of Da`wah and jihad, and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and refuting the people of bid`ah, all of which must be accompanied with sound knowledge based on the Revelation.
We ask Allah to make us among them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.
And Allah knows best."

If you are traveling and you are shortening your prayers, is the witr prayer still wajib?",Some scholars said that qiyam al-layl and witr are the best of the voluntary prayers. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not neglect prayers during the night nor the two rak`ahs before Fajr neither in residence nor in travel.,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars assert that witr prayer is a confirmed sunnah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) practiced consistently, and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith regarding the Bedouin who once came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asking about Islam, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) answered, ""Five prayers within one day-and-night."" The Bedouin asked, ""Am I obliged to other than those?"" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, ""(not) Unless you volunteer of your own."" (Agreed upon)
Some scholars have said that qiyam al-layl (prayer at the heart of night) and witr prayer are the best of the voluntary prayers . Therefore, one should consistently practice them and not neglect them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not neglect the prayers during the  night nor two rak`ahs before Fajr neither in residence nor in travel as reported in authentic hadiths.
And Allah knows best."
120,209,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/209,How many adhaan for fajr,"Question

                How many adthans are there for fajr? If people are in the mosque do you still say 
""prayer is better than sleep"" I heard it is a biddah to do this. Apparently there is a hadith 
to this effect. Could you send something?",,"Praise be to Allah.There were two calls for salaat ul-fajr (prayer) at the time of Allaah's Messenger  (peace be upon 
him), the first just before dawnfor those who are awake performing night prayers( Qe iaam 
Al-lyl) so as for them to either rest for Fajr or have food if they intend to fast the next day, and for 
those who are asleep in order they may begin to arouse and be ready for Fajr( since it is preferred 
as early as possible)and the second at the actual time of fajr to indicate the appropriate time and to 
call people to the prayer, among other benefits of the adhaan. 
Regarding the second point, jumhoor al-'ulemaa' (majority of the scholars) agree that the statement 
(within adhaan for fajr) ""prayer is superior to sleeping"" should be said in the second call to prayer. 
Hence, the caller or mu'athin should adhere to the saying phrase and recite it even if people are inside 
the mosque. It contains benefits which might be slip one's mind. Moreover, it reminds people of the 
very fact: ""prayer is superior to sleep"" which concerns the immediate day as well as all forthcoming 
days. Muslims benefit from it even when they are already in the mosque and gain the reward of 
repeating it after mu'athin, as per the saying of the Prophet 
:
""If you hear al-Mu'athin, say [i.e, repeat] as he says"" 
which is hadith sahih. Perhaps women and children who live near the masjid may benefit as well, and 
even the Muslims among the jinn. Additionally, there may be some people who feel sleepy inside the 
mosque or those who have nodded off while sitting. Thus, Muslims should preserve and practice this 
sunnah and not abandon it. May Allaah make us all successful in following the sunnah and vigilant in 
adhering and preserving it."

                For a great time now my community and I have been concerned with the issue of foods such as Gelatin, mono and dyglycerides, pepsin and rennetAll these thing are in our foods today and yet we do not know what we can eat and the reason for each. PLease give me a very detailed response that could end this trouble.",,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah
      has blessed His slaves by creating for them all kinds of provision on
      earth, and He has permitted them to eat from that which is halaal
      (permissible) and good; this includes very many things, it is not limited.
      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow
      not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open
      enemy.” [al-Baqarah 2:168]
Allaah
      forbids a limited number of foods, as He says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): “I find not in that which has
      been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to
      eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by
      slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely,
      is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered
      as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols,
      or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).”
      [al-An’aam 6:145]
 The
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the
      eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs, and every bird which
      has talons. (Narrated
      by Muslim, 6/60)
 And
      he forbade the flesh of (domestic) donkeys (narrated
      by al-Mukhari in al-Fath, no. 4215).
 Of
      the foods which are to be found nowadays, some of them are clearly haraam,
      such as dead meat [from an animal which has died naturally as opposed to
      being slaughtered properly] and pork. Some foods may contain ingredients
      and derivatives which come from haraam sources, so we have to find out
      where they come from so that we may know what the ruling is concerning
      them. The gelatin which was mentioned in the question may originate from
      the skin, muscles and bones of haraam animals such as pigs. Hence gelatin
      which is derived from collagen which comes from pigs is haraam, because it
      is as if the pig had been turned into salt. The most correct view is that
      it is haraam even if it has been changed, so long as it originally came
      from a pig, which is haraam.
 The
      fats which are used in foods come either from vegetable sources or animal
      sources.
 If
      they come from vegetable sources they are halaal, so long as they have not
      been mixed with anything that is impure (najjis) or anything that could
      contaminate them. If they come from animal sources, they are either from
      animals that we are permitted to eat or animals that we are not permitted
      to eat. 
If
      they come from an animal that we are permitted to eat, then they come
      under the same ruling as the meat of that animal. 
If
      they come from an animal which it is haraam for us to eat – such as pigs
      – then we look at whether they are used in foods or for other purposes. 
If
      they are usedfor non-food
      purposes, e.g. many fats are used in making soap, then there is a
      difference of scholarly opinion, but the most correct view is that they
      are haraam. 
If
      they are used in foods, e.g., pig fat (lard) is used in making sweets and
      other foods, this is haraam. 
With
      regard to cheese: if it is made from the milk of an animal which we are
      not permitted to eat, then according to scholarly consensus it is not
      permissible to eat it. If it is made from the milk of an animal which we
      are permitted to eat, and it is known that it is made with rennet that has
      been derived from an animal slaughtered according to sharee’ah andit has not been mixed with any najaasah (impurity), then it may be
      eaten. 
If
      it was made with rennet derived from dead meat, there is a difference of
      scholarly opinion as to whether we may eat it, but the most correct view
      is that it is haraam. 
If
      it was made with rennet from a source which is inherently naajis (impure),
      such as rennet derived from pigs, then it should not be eaten. 
See
      Ahkaam al-At’imah fi’l-Sharee’ah al-Islamiyyah by al-Tareeqi,
      p. 482 
In
      many cases these matters are unclear to the Muslim (he does not know the
      source of food ingredients). In this case, it is better to fear Allaah and
      be cautious. Avoiding doubtful things may be preferable to using them in
      these circumstances, as stated in the hadeeth narrated by al-Nu’maan ibn
      Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger
      of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say – and
      al-Nu’maan pointed to hisears
      – “That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain,
      and between the two of them there are doubtful matters about which not
      many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in
      regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful
      matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures
      around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a
      sanctuary, and truly Allaah’s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in
      the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it is sound, all the body issound and which, if it is corrupt, all of it will be corrupt. Truly
      it is the heart.”
(Narrated
      by Muslim, 1599).
From
      the above we learn that the basic principle concerning food is that it is
      halaal, apart from those things for which there is clear evidence (daleel)
      that they are haraam, such as dead meat, blood, animals sacrificed to
      other than Allaah and meat over which the name of Allaah was not
      pronounced at the time of slaughter. Concerning the foods mentioned in the
      question: if it is proven that they contain ingredients derived from
      haraam sources, it is necessary to avoid them, otherwise they need not be
      avoided. If you are not sure whether they contain anything haraam or not
      – without being paranoid or succumbing to the waswaas (insinuating
      whispers of the Shaytaan) – then it is preferable to avoid them as a
      precaution out of fear of Allaah.
And
      Allaah knows best."
122,211,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/211,Sujood Ul-Sahw if in doubt while praying,"Question

The question is regarding the unsureness of the number of rakaats ones prayed. How would we go about correcting it. Some say at the end of prayer you say salam once and go into sujdah and others say you finish your prayer and than do the sujdah.
This issue is very confusing please explain.",,"Praise be to Allah.The prostration of forgetfulness (sujood ul-sahw) is required whenever one inadvertently adds extraneous parts or misses parts or is in doubt regarding parts of the arkaan (essential pillars) of the prayer and/or its other requirements. The question posed regards what to do when in doubt regarding the number of raka’aat prayed, and the answer is covered in the following points:
First, definition of doubtfulness: when two possibilities are equally probable without knowing or feeling one is more likely true than the other.
Second, when one doubts after performing salaam: One should disregard such doubt. For example, take the case of one who has completed praying dhuhr then questions after finishing the prayer, ""Did I really pray four raka’aat or only three?"" Such doubt should be disregarded completely unless it is substantiated by clear and certain indications; otherwise, it opens the door to waswasah (the whispering of Satan) and unwarranted extraneous additions to the prayer.
Third, when one doubts during the prayer; this must fall into one of the following two cases:

One can discern that one of the two possibilities about which one is in doubt is more likely or more certain by virtue of one’s prevalent feeling or most likely inclination: In this case, one should act according to his best assumption and perform the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. The evidence for this opinion is what was related by Ibn Mas’ood, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed either an extraneous addition or missed an essential part of the prayer (one of the narrators of the hadeeth was in doubt which). After saying ‘salaam,’ it was said to him, ""Oh Prophet of Allah, has there been a new change in [the way of performing] the prayer?"" He replied, ""Why [would you say that]?"" They responded, ""You prayed in such and such manner."" So he bent his legs and faced towards the qiblah and performed two prostrations then performed tasleem (saying ‘salaam’ to the right then the left). After facing towards us, he said, ""If something new had been introduced regarding the prayers, I would have informed you about it. To the contrary, I am but a human like you I forget as you forget, so if I forget, remind and inform me. If any of you doubts during his prayer then he should try to discern the more certain and correct case, then complete the prayer based upon it, then perform tasleem, followed by two prostrations."" (Al-Bukhari, Fath Al-Baari #401).
One cannot discern nor is there any prevalence apparent to indicate which of the two cases is more certain: In this case, one should assume the least of the two and continue based on this assumption, then perform the two prostrations of doubt before tasleem. An example of this would be one who while praying the dhuhr prayer is completely uncertain whether he has completed three or four raka’aat and cannot determine which is more true. Thus, he would assume the lesser of the two, i.e. three, and complete another raka’ah then sit for the tashahhud, then prostrate two prostrations before saying ""salaam."" The basis for this ruling is the hadeeth related by Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, in which he said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ""If any of you doubts during his prayer and he does not know how many [raka’aat] he has prayed, whether it is three or four, then he should discard and cast away his doubt. He is to continue upon what one is sure of [i.e. the lesser] then perform two prostrations before making tasleem. If he ends up [in reality] praying five [raka’aat], then his prayer will be an intercession for him; and if he ends up completely the [requisite] four [raka’aat] then it is targheeman for shaytaan."" (targheeman: i.e., a way of vexing Satan and humiliating and debasing him, as well as rejecting him as a result of his failure to achieve his desire of disturbing the worshipper.) (Al-Nawawi in explaining the hadeeth from Sahih Muslim, 5/60)."
123,212,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212,Accepting donations from non-Muslims,"Question

                Can muslims accept donations from
      non-muslims to use
     in Islamic Cause?",,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) gave
    one of the chapters in his Saheeh the title of “Baab qabool al-hadiyah min
    al-mushrikeen (Chapter on accepting gifts from the polytheists),” under which
    heading he listed a number of ahaadeeth indicating that this is permitted.
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented: “On this topic, Abu Dawood and
    al-Tirmidhi narrated from ‘Ayyaad ibn Himar [??] who said: ‘I gave the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a gift of a she-camel. He asked me,
    “Have you become Muslim?” I said, “No.” He said, “I have been
    forbidden to accept the gifts of the mushrikeen.”’ Then al-Haafiz (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) quoted some of the comments made by the scholars to reconcile the texts
    which indicate that such gifts should be refused with those which indicate that they
    should be accepted. (The scholars said that) gifts should be refused when the intention
    behind them is to win the Muslim over (by softening his heart towards them), and they
    should be accepted when by doing so there is the hope of befriending that person and
    opening his heart to Islam.
There is nothing wrong with accepting unsolicited gifts and donations
    from non-Muslims, and it is permissible to spend them on Islamic projects and in other
    ways.
But asking for donations from non-Muslims carries several risks, such
    as being humiliated in front of them or being controlled by them.
If there is no danger of such things happening, there is nothing wrong
    with asking. When he was still in Makkah, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) used to ask for help for the sake of da’wah, without any humiliation
    involved, from some of the mushrikeen, such as his uncle Abu Taalib and others. There is
    no humiliation involved in putting out charity boxes or circulating flyers giving account
    numbers for donations, and so on. And Allaah knows best."
124,213,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/213,Employment in private and government sectors,"Question

                Finding Islamic employment is sometimes difficult. Is it necessarily incorrect 
to work for a state government? I feel that it's better than working for most 
businesses, at least better than working for businesses revolve around interest 
transactions.
I would greatly appreciate some direction on this. 
Thank You",,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah.
Muslims must realize that the age of living estranged (religiously) in non-Muslim 
societies effects the proliferation of the haraam and the diminishment of the halaal.
It is very possible what you have suggested is true, since the business sector specifically 
is more involved in interest than those in the government sector. However, I do not 
think that this cannot be generalized as a matter of principle in this matter. In general, 
we can say that it is permissible for the muslim to work in any sector as long as the 
work there involves halaal activities, and that it is not permissible to work in any 
occupation or position in any sector which would involve the Muslim in a function that 
is muharram. 
(interpretation of the meaning):
""... And for those who fear Allaah, He (ever) prepares a way out, and He provides for 
him from (sources) he never could imagine. And if anyone puts his trust in Allaah, 
sufficient is (Allaah) for him. For Allaah will surely accomplish His purpose; indeed, 
for all things has Allaah appointed a due proportion"". (Surah At-Talaaq, 65:2-3)"

So long as a woman adheres to these conditions, she may wear whatever she likes in public places and elsewhere, and her hijaab will be considered Islamic. These conditions may be summarized as follows:


The hijaab must cover her entire body


It should be thick enough to conceal what is underneath it


It should be loose-fitting, not tight


It should not be so attractive as to call men’s attention to it


It should not be perfumed


It should not be a dress of fame and vanity (i.e., it shouldn't be extravagant or excessively opulent)


It should not resemble the dress of men


It should not resemble the dress of kaafir women


It should not be adorned with any crosses or pictures of animate beings

If you are a minor and your parents earn income that might be haram for example they service businesses among them are bars, and deal with interest like when paying deposits on a apartments they rent out. My question is that there is I think (several hadith) where it says that Allah does not accept du'as and prayers of those who get there sustenance through haram means. If a little of the sustenance (money) is from haram means, and you are a minor in this case does hadith count in your case?",,"Praise be to Allah.Expenditure is obligatory upon a father to his son/daughter according to the Islamic law and shari'ah, as regards his/her housing, clothing, food, drink and the like. However, the concept is not tied to being a ""minor"" in the sense of Western laws. The requirement according to Islamic shari'ah are:

that the person spent upon is poor or does not own anything, or does not own or possess what is enough for his requirements and is unable to gain their own income.
that the one spending has enough wealth to spend on himself and his wife.
that the one spending and the one spent upon are of the same religion.

When the son/daughter is in need for expenses, then he/she is allowed to take from his/her father's earning even though it is haram (forbidden). In such a case his/her du'aa' to Allah won't be affected, since being a minor, he/she has neither might nor power. But while doing so, he/she should abide by the following observations:

Not to expand and widen the scope of taking or accepting from his/her father's illegitimate earnings.
He/she should try if he/she is able to earn a halaal income to become independent and self-sufficient and no longer in need of the father's support.
To try as hard as possible all ways to admonish and advise he/her parents in the hope that Allah Almighty may guide them towards repentance from haram earnings."

                I found an offensive site to Islam. Can we do something to explain the truth?
Shukran Jazillan",,"Praise be to Allah.You have discovered pages at a particular site, for which you have asked a proper rejoinder, that indeed 
show hostility towards the religion of Islam, ridicule the personality of our Prophet  (peace be upon 
him) and carry false accusations and distortions. However, the matter is as said by Allaah (azza wa jall) 
(interpretation of the meaning): 
""They want to blow out, with their mouths, the light that Allah has sent, but Allah has decided to 
bring this light to a completion even though the disbelievers do not like it"" (Al-Tawbah 9:32) 
I do not see any point in announcing the URL of their page in any other Islamic page which Muslims 
visit frequently. We should not propagate its existence or invite people to it even by indirect means. 
What I see as important is that some capable persons should send the proper translation of meanings of 
the following verse of Qur'an and other such verses to them: 
""Those who disbelieve spend their wealth in distracting people from the right path, will continue to 
spend until it becomes a source of regret for them and then they will be overcome. And the disbelievers 
will be resurrected towards Hellfire so that Allaah may distinguish the evil from the righteous""
It should be enough to send them this and similar verses of Quran in rejoinder and to raise their anger. 
Doing so will be an act of worship and nearness to Allaah as Allaah (azza wa jall) has informed about the 
true believers (interpretation of the meaning):
""They suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allaah, nor they take any step to 
raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a 
deed of righteousness. Surely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the righteous""(At-Tawbah, 9:120)

1. What is the position of a woman when her husband invites his brother to dinner, does she eat dinner with them, can she serve him?
2. Is the husband’s brother a mahram, can she travel with him?",The husband's brother is not a mahram. A woman is not permitted to travel with her husband's brother who is not her mahram. A wife is permitted to serve her husband and his guests if she is wearing complete hijab and nothing of her body can be seen.,"Praise be to Allah.Can your wife serve your guests?
A wife is permitted to serve her husband and his guests if she is wearing complete hijab and nothing of her body can be seen. She is also permitted to sit with them so long as there is no sitting alone with one non-mahram man, wanton display or other cause of temptation involved.

As far as eating with them is concerned, if this involves uncovering some part of her body, then she should not eat with them.
Is a brother-in-law a mahram?
The husband's brother is not a mahram . The various types of mahram have been described in the Quran. On this basis, it is not permitted for her to travel with him .

In view of the seriousness of the matter of non-mahram men, especially the husband's relatives, entering upon women , and the fact that so many people take this matter lightly, there follow a few words of important advice:
Warning against non-mahram relatives entering upon women in the absence of their husbands
Some homes are not free of the presence of relatives of the husband who are not mahrams of his wife. They may be living with him for a number of reasons, such as brothers who are students or bachelors. These men enter the house without there being any sense of something strange, because they are known to the neighbours as relatives of the head of the household. The neighbours know that this is a brother, or nephew or uncle. This casual approach leads to many immoral deeds that earn the wrath of Allah because the limits that He has prescribed are not being adhered to. The basic principle in this matter should be the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Beware of entering upon women."" A man of the Ansar asked, ""O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about the brother-in-law?"" He said, ""The brother-in-law is death."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 9/330)

Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 
“This hadith refers to all the relatives of the husband apart from his father and sons, who are mahrams for the wife and she is allowed to be alone with them; they are not described as ""death."" It refers to the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and other relatives of the husband whom she would be permitted to marry if she were not already married. Because people customarily treat this matter so lightly, and a man may sit alone with his brother's wife, the brother-in-law is likened to death, and he is the foremost among non-mahram men who should be prevented from doing so.
Meaning of ‘the brother-in-law is death’
The expression ""the brother-in-law is death "" may have a number of meanings, such as the following:

That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to religious doom if it results in sin.
That it may lead to actual death if an immoral deed is committed that dictates the punishment of stoning.
That it may spell disaster for the woman if her husband's jealousy leads to divorce.
That you should fear being alone with a non-mahram woman as much as you fear death.
That being alone with a non-mahram woman is as terrible as death.

All of this stems from the fact that Islam wants to preserve families and households, and prevent anything that could lead to their destruction. What do you say now, after hearing the warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about those husbands who say to their wives: ""If my brother comes and I am not here, show him into the sitting-room"" or a woman who says to a male visitor: ""Go into the sitting room"" - when there is no-one else present in the house?

To those who take the idea of trustworthiness as an excuse, and say things like, ""I trust my wife and I trust my brother or my cousin,"" we say: do not trust too much and do not doubt too much, but know that the hadith ""No man sits alone with a (non-mahram) woman , but the Shaytan is the third among them"" (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1171) includes both the most righteous of people as well as the most immoral of people, and that Islam makes no exceptions whatsoever in such reports.

This is the problem. A man marries a woman and brings her to his family's home, where she lives happily with him, then his younger brother starts to enter upon her when her husband is absent, and they begin to talk in an affectionate or even passionate manner. This leads to two things: she begins to detest her husband, and grows attached to his brother, but she cannot divorce her husband, or do what she wants to with the other. This is the grievous torment. This story represents one aspect of corruption, besides which are other kinds which reach the level of immoral sexual conduct and illegitimate children.
Can wife travel with husband’s brother?
In answer to the second question, a woman is not permitted to travel with her husband's brother , who is not her mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""A woman should not travel unless she is with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless she has a mahram with her."" (Al-Bukhari, 1729)
Among the conditions of a mahram for travel purposes are: he should be someone whom she is permanently forbidden to marry, such as her grandfather, father, brother, paternal uncle, nephew, etc. 
And Allah knows best."
129,219,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219,What Are the Merits of Islam?,"Question

Why do Muslims think that Islam is true? Is there any factual basis?","Among the merits of Islam is that it enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage…","Praise be to Allah.Why Islam is the true religion
This is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered Islam , but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following:

The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. 

Thus the Muslim’s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. 
Allah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people’s hearts.
The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it.

The effects of Islamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following:


Prayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a ""powerful support,"" which is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: ""Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer."" If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist?


Now let us look at Zakah (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islam . Zakah purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it.


Fasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure.


Hajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allah, which was built by Ibrahim (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world.


Islam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil . It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others. 

What are the good characteristics in Islam?
Islam enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards one’s fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salam) and to seek permission before entering another person’s house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see.
Some non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allah or salvation of the Day of Judgement.
What is forbidden in Islam?
If we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man. 
The following examples demonstrate this:

Islam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allah and the worship of anything other than Allah, because this spells doom and misery.


Islam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and people’s lives; cursing time, because Allah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism.


Islam forbids cancelling out good deeds by showing off , boasting or reminding others of one’s favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allah on one another or damning one another to Hell.


Islam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning one’s back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting one’s hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up.


Islam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer.


Islam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of one’s wudu - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour.


Islam forbids buying, selling and making ""lost and found"" announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allah, where worldly affairs have no place.


Islam forbids haste in walking when the iqamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner. 


It is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque; to decorate a mosque with red or yellow paint or adornments which will distract the worshippers; to fast day after day without a break.


Islam forbids building over graves, making them high, sitting on them, walking between them wearing shoes, putting lights over them or writing on them.


It is forbidden to disinter the dead or to take graves as places of worship. 


Islam forbids wailing, tearing one’s clothes or leaving one’s hair unkempt when a person dies. 


Eulogizing the dead in the manner of the times of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah) is also forbidden, although there is nothing wrong with informing others that a person has died.


Islam forbids the consumption of riba (interest); all kinds of selling which involve ignorance (of the product), misleading and cheating; selling blood, wine, pork, idols and everything that Allah has forbidden - their price, whether bought or sold - is haram (unlawful); najash, which is offering a price for something one has no intention of buying, as happens in many auctions; concealing a product’s faults at the time of selling; selling something which one does not own or before it comes into one’s possession; undercutting, outbidding or out bargaining another; selling produce before it is clear that it is in good condition and free of blemish; cheating in weights and measures; and hoarding. 


A partner who has shares in a plot of land or a date palm tree is forbidden to sell his share without consulting his partners.

                How soon do a married couple have to consumate their marriage in Islam? 
If one of the partners feels uncomfortable, what is he/she
to do, if he/she does not want to consumate right away, but
would prefer to wait about 3 months?",,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. 

If a man executes a valid marriage contract with a woman then it is
permissible for the two to do as they please between themselves, even with
only the contract.  There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah
between the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up
to the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their
best interests. 

It is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the
other one's personal comfort and ease.  Thus, if the husband sees that the
wife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship
and level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example,
he should do so, and vice versa.  Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife
if she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by
consummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he
does not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice
versa."

                Assalam'alaicum wa rahmatoullahi wa barakatouh 
I heard a muslim brother and a imam saying that: 
a) People who have children and embrace islam should make a 'aqiqa for them
(the children), no matter how old they are and also one for themselves
because their non-muslim parents did not make one for them;

b) Making a 'aqiqa is so important that if one doesn't have the money to
make it, he should borrow that money.

However, they didn't give any references to prove what they said.  What is
the truth?",,"Praise be to Allah.wa aliaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh.

al-hamdu lillaah.


(a) Jumhoor al-ulemaa' (vast majority of the scholars) agree that the
aqeeqa is a sunnah mustahabbah for those who are capable of doing it and
can afford it.  Among its benefits are breaking the influence of the
shaitaan on the new-born.  It is also permissible for a Muslim to make an
aqeeqah for himself if his parents did not perform it for him.  Similarly,
he can do it for his children even if it is after many years if he didn't
do it when they were young. 

Refer to the book ""Tuhfat ul-Mawdood bi-Ahkaam il-Mawlood"" by Imam Ibn
ul-Qayyim, Chapter 6: ""The Aqeeqah and its Rulings"", Part 19: ""The Ruling
for One Whose Parents Did Not Perform an Aqeeqah--Should He Perform one on
His Own Behalf?"" for more details.  It is mentioned there that Ismaa'il ibn
Sa'eed al-Shaalanji  asked (Imam) Ahmed regarding a man whose father
informed him that he did not perform an aqeeqah on his behalf--should he
perform it on his own behalf?  He said, 

""That is the father's duty."" ...

and it was said, ""Should one perform an aqeeqah on his own behalf as an
adult?""  ... and I saw that it is preferrable if an aqeeqah was not
performed as a child then it should be performed as an adult, and (Imam
Ahmed) said:
""If someone does that I would not discourage it or regard it as
reprehensible."" 

(b) It is not mandatory for a person to take a loan in order to spend on an
aqeeqah.  However, if he does it then it would be considered commendable as
per Imam Ahmed's opinion.  It was related by Abi il-Harith that he asked
Abu Abdullah regarding one who doesn't have enough to perform an aqeeqah;
Imam Ahmed said, 
""If he borrowed for it I hope Allaah would reward and
provide for him by virtue that he has observed a sunnah."" 

Refer to ""Tuhfat il-Mawdood,"" same chapter, Part 11: ""Regarding Borrowing
for an Aqeeqah and its Rulings and Benefits."""

My brother, after returning from a trip, started acting very strangely. He would say weird things and now doesn't talk to anyone at all. He has been sitting outside for 2 months now. He has even spit on our mother. At first we thought there was something psychologically wrong with him. However, when we took him to a mental doctor, he talked as if he was fine. We think he is either possessed by a Jinn or some magic was done to him.
 
How can you tell if someone is possessed or if magic was done to them? How do you remove it? My mother is getting very sick over this.",People who have had experience with black magic or jinn possession refer to some signs which are mentioned in the detailed answer.,"Praise be to Allah.Signs of jinn or Satanic possession
People who have had experience with such situations have related that the following are among the signs of a person who is possessed by jinn (or Satan):

Strong repulsion when hearing the Quran or Athan (call for prayers).
Episodes of losing consciousness and/or epileptic attacks, especially when Quran is recited for the possessed person.
Frequent nightmares during sleep.
Tendency to avoid people accompanied by out-of-the-norm behavior.
The jinni who possess him might speak when the Quran is recited for the possessed person.
Madness, as stated in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): ""Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom Satan by his touch hath driven to [epileptic] madness"" (2:275)

Signs of black magic
As for a person struck by magic he might experience the following:

Dislike of ones’ spouse, as indicated in the Quran by the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): ""And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife..."" (Al-Baqarah, 2:102)
Different attitude in the house from that which is outside the house. For example, a person will feel that he is missing his family when is outside the house but when he goes home, love changes quickly to extreme hatred.
Inability to have sexual intercourse with ones spouse.
Frequent miscarriage for pregnant women.
Sudden change in behavior without obvious reason.
Complete loss of appetite for food.
Thinking or imagining one has done something when in reality one has not.
Sudden obedience and/or love for a particular person.

It should be noted that if a person experiences some of the above symptoms this does not necessarily mean that he is either possessed by a jinni or struck by black magic. It might be due to physiological or psychological reasons.
How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession
As for curing this condition the following steps are recommended:

Putting ones trust in Allah with a sincere belief that He is the only cure for everything.
Reading Quran and known supplications expressing seeking refuge, the most important and effective of which is sura 113 and 114, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas, which were used to cure the Prophet himself. Surah 112, Al-Ikhlas, is recommended along with them, as well as the opening chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatihah. To cure black magic, some have successfully used seven lote-tree leaves. The leaves should be crushed, then mixed with water (enough for taking a bath). The following verses from the Quran are then recited: verse Al-Kursi (2:255), surah Al-Kafirun (109), surah 112, 113, 114; the verses which mention magic, which are: in surah Al-Baqarah (2:102), Al-A’raf (7:117-119), Yunus (10:79-82), and Taha (20:65-69). The possessed person drinks some of the water, and the rest is used to give him a bath.
Removing the elements of magic as was done by the Prophet when he was struck by black magic by a Jewish man called Lubaid ibn Al-’Asim.
Eating seven Aliya Al-Barniy dates (among the dates of Al-Madinah) first thing in the morning; if not possible, any dates will suffice, by the will of Allah.
Cupping --removing excess blood.
Offering supplications.

And we ask Allah to cure your brother and ease your hardship and his, as He is the One who cures and there is no one else who can cure.
And Allah knows best."

Cards, on which we are paying interest. My question is , is the money we are making and 
paying off our Debts is Hilal or Haram, plus the profits. Second thing, i am working their 
too and i take salary, is that Halal ? 
Thank u,,,,",,"Praise be to Allah.Borrowing with interest is considered one of the greatest of the major sins (al-kabaa'ir). The Prophet  
(Peace Be Upon Him) has cursed those who consume interest, and those who pay it. Borrowing money 
with interest is considered as peddling in it as the borrower pays it to the borrower. Whoever does this 
is to repent and express remorse, and he is to try as much as he can to return only the principle he 
borrowed without the interest, advising the person who lent him the money against this practice. If he 
cannot, as in the case of borrowing from interest-based banks, which rarely forgive but rather get back 
their dues even if by force, he is to return the principle plus the interest offering repentance to Allaah at 
the same time.
Whatever the borrower has bought or developed in terms of legitimate and Islamically-permitted 
business based on the borrowed money, can remain in his possession. He is allowed to continue his 
enterprise and profit from it, paying sadaqah at the time on a frequent basis to purify his business and 
himself of the misdeed he has committed. Those who work in businesses functioning on money 
borrowed using interest for which they are not responsible can continue to work in such enterprises as 
long as the nature of the business is halaal and legitimate such as a Laundromat, etc.

My family is not very religious but I try to be, but am constantly mocked and ridiculed for trying to follow the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad and enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong. My family think I am extreme in my views because I hold hadith in high regard, whereas my father does not. He believes that a hadith explaining the commandments in the Qur'an, for example praying, should be followed, but those concerning matters outside of the Quran, for example prohibition of touching a female who is not your mehram, should not be followed. He has many other beliefs, but my question is this:
Is it permissible for me to pray behind him with him as the Imam? If not, is it permissible for me to pretend that I am praying so that he does not feel offended that I do not want to pray behind him? Because I have read in Quran that children should not hurt their parents, and one of the biggest sins in Islam is a child making his parents cry, and I feel that in telling him that I am not able to pray behind him, I would infact hurt him.
I eagerly await your response. Jazzakallahkhairum for your help.
Wa alaykum-as-salam wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh.",,"Praise be to Allah.The situation in which you are, dear brother, is certainly a difficult one. It is not easy to live with a father that has aberrations and perversities stemming from being misguided from the true path of ahl us-sunnah wal-jamaaah (the followers of the Quran, sunnah, and our pious predecessors). However, a Muslim is to anticipate and seek reward from Allah for: being patient with and persevering in dealing with your father; and, being polite when counseling and showing him the truth of guidance, using appropriate and agreeable methods that do not give your father the impression that you are trying to show superiority or arrogance, or that you are belittling him. Instead, your father should feel that the advice is from a son that acknowledges and respects his position as his father, and that your concern is out of care and veneration., as the case was with Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when calling his father to the path of truth. Allah the Most Glorious said in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
When he (Ibrahim) said to his father: ""O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything? O my father! Verily, there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. O my father! Worship not Satan. Verily, Satan has been a rebel against the Most Beneficent (Allah). O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allah) overtake you, so that you become a companion of Satan ( in Hell-Fire)."" He (the father) said: "" Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop (this), I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely before I punish you."" Ibrahim said :"" Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me, ever most gracious. (surat Maryam, 19:41-47)
Note that Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) addressed his father in the most subordinate and most refined, courteous, and polite expression (abati in Arabic). Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not say to him, ""I am a scholar and you are ignorant""; instead, he said ""There has come to me of knowledge (as a Prophet) that which has not come unto you."" Ibrahim (peace be upon him) showed his concern and compassion towards his fathers well-being when he said, ""O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allah) overtake you."" When his father rejected the truth and threatened to stone him, Ibrahim (peace be upon him) replied in utmost politeness, ""Peace be upon you,"" and promised him that he will pray to his Lord on his behalf for forgiveness. This is how a righteous son should advise his misguided father.
You also should know that rejecting or denying the sunnah of our Prophet (peace be upon him) is an extremely grave matter; hopefully this subject will be covered in detail as a separate issue. In brief, if your fathers bidaah (innovation in religion) takes him out of the fold of Islam, then your prayers behind him is not valid since he would be a kafir (infidel, unbeliever). Such would be the case if, for example, he insists and persists in completely rejecting the sunnah in its entirety, even after the proof and evidence demonstrating and substantiating the truth and validity of the matter is presented to him. On the other hand, if your fathers bidaah does not take him out of the fold of Islam, such as the case of refusing to perform certain acts mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, then it is permissible to pray behind him and your prayers are sound, and Allah knows best.
Addendum: Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn Uthaimeen has replied the following with regards to this question:
Denying (the sunnah) could be of two types: a denial with regards to interpretation or a denial of rejection. If it is a denial of rejection, in the sense that one might say, ""Yes, I realize that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this, but I reject it and dont accept it,"" then the person is a kaafir (unbeliever) and has committed apostasy. Thus, it would be impermissible to pray behind him. If, on the other hand, it is a denial of interpretation, then he is granted a respite, if the interpretation is possible and warranted by the language, and he knows the sources of Islamic law and its resources. In this case, it is not an act of kufr, but rather under the category of those who innovate incorrect practices in the religion (if his interpretation is such). It would be permissible to pray behind such a person, unless there is a beneficial objective behind not doing so, such as deterring him from such opinions, so that he may reconsider his mistaken interpretations. In this latter case, then it would be preferable not to pray behind him (if such a beneficial effect would be realized)."

The Prophet himself did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death.","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday)?
There is nothing in the Quran to say that we should celebrate the Mawlid al-Nabi or the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet himself did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. 
Indeed, he told his Companions not to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be peace). He said: “Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, ‘The slave of Allah and His Messenger.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari)
What did Prophet Muhammad do on the day of his birth?
What has been reported is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made the day of his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said: “That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation.” (Reported by Muslim, al-Nasai and Abu Dawood)
Did the Companions celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi?
Moreover, we know that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the people who loved the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) most. 
Was it reported that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), who was the closest of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 
Was it reported that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who ruled for twelve years, or ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), did this?
Was it reported that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), his relative and foster son, did this? 
Was it reported that any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did this?
No, by Allah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 
No one would say such a thing except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray.
Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi?
Did any of the imams – Abu Haneefah, Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen (may Allah have mercy on them) – do this or command others to do it or say that it was good? By Allah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three centuries. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: “The best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take such a matter seriously).” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). 
When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear?
The celebration of the Prophet’s birthday appeared many centuries later, when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bid’ah had become widespread.
Thus this celebration became a sign of one’s love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? But can it be possible that the Sahabah, the imams and the people of the best three centuries were unaware of it, and it was only those who came later who were aware of its importance?! 
How to express love for Prophet Muhammad
What the Quran tells us is that love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is demonstrated by following the guidance he brought. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Say: ‘Obey Allah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:31-32]
The first ayah explains that love is just a claim, but the proof of sincerity is following what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. The second ayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allah and His Messenger. 
Hence Allah ended the ayah with a very stern warning in which those who refuse to obey are described as kafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask Allah to keep us safe from that. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought – as all the scholars agree. He said: “The best of speech is the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.” (Reported by Muslim and al-Nasai).
We ask Allah to protect us from bid’ah and to bless us by helping us to follow.
Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.
And Allah knows best."

                I have heard that the reason behind women not being able to visit the deceased is because the 
people in the graves are able to see people that are alive, naked. But this doesn't make any 
sense to me, and I am a little confused, because my sister and mother would like to visit my 
father's grave, and have visited, but I feel awkward not knowing if it is permissible or not? 
I don't see anything wrong with it my self, but please do clarify this situation ASAP.
Thank You very much (Jazak-Allah Khayr)",,"Praise be to Allah.The reason for prohibiting women from visiting graves is the ahaadeeth of the Prophet 
 (peace be upon 
him) mentioned in question #127. It is not because dead people can see their visitors. This reason is invalid 
and the rules of the world of the dead people are different from the rules dealing with the world of living 
people. If the reason for prohibition was the ability of the deceased to see people who are alive naked, then 
it would also be prohibited for men to visit the graves. 
You need to encourage your mother and sister to make du'aa (supplication) for your father, as this offers 
the greatest benefit to the deceased, and it is much better than the mere visit. Tell them that this du'aa will 
benefit him whenever and wherever the person making the du'aa is, whether he or she is near the grave or 
far away from it. 
We ask Allaah to have mercy upon your deceased, and to give you patiencefor your loss. 
To Allaah we belong and to him is our return."
139,254,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/254,Hanging Quranic Verses on Walls,"Question

When visiting Muslims, I noticed that many of them put verses of the Quran on the walls or pictures with the names Allah and Muhammad. I know a lot of Muslims think that it is good to do so because it will protect them and their house. Personally, I consider it a form of shirk or superstition. Is there any ruling on that subject?","If hanging Quranic verses on walls is for purposes of decoration and adornment, this is an inappropriate use of the Quran as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.","Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following:

In most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.
Some people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images.
This is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated.
Hanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du’as taught in the Quran and Sunnah.
There is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money.
Many of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram.
Many of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings.
Verses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned.
Some Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way.

All in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads?
What really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter.
The Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

between brothers and sisters haram in the Quran? 
Can you recommend a good book(s) on Islamic Law covering every and each aspect of

All Praise be to Allaah.
As long as you are confident in your heart about your belief, no such insinuations will hurt you (inshaa' 
Allaah). If a doubt strikes a believer or something appears to him as a conflict between different textual 
sources of Shari'ah, he must believe that indeed for such doubts there are true answers and for such 
apparent conflicts there are solutions even if he doesnt know it or is unable to find the right answer 
himself. However, a person should not collect all the doubts in his heart and worry about the 
complexities and leave aside the learning of useful knowledge. This is because it is incumbent upon a 
Muslim to learn and know things which have been clearly described (Muhkamaat) in Shari'ah so that he 
may be able to repel the doubts. 
Regarding the question you have asked, it is a known fact that legislation differs from one Shari'ah to 
another, while the principles and beliefs remain the same in all of them. So, making of portraits was 
allowed in the Shari'ah of Sulayman (peace be upon him) but is prohibited in our Shari'ah. Similarly, 
making prostration of salutation was permitted in the Shari'ah of Yusuf (peace be upon him) but is illegal 
in ours. Also, war booty was prohibited for nations before us but it is completely legal for us. The 
Qiblah of people before us used to be towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, but for us it is towards Ka'bah. In a 
similar way, marriage between brothers and sisters was permitted in the Shari'ah of Adam (peace be 
upon him) as opposed to those that came afterwards. The following is a clarification on the issue by 
Haafidh Ibn Katheer, who said: 
Allaah allowed Adam (peace be upon him) to marry his daughters to his sons for necessity. Every 
couple used to have a boy and a girl. Hence, he married the girl of one couple to the boy of another. 
This is said by Suddi regarding what has been narrated by Abu Maalik and Abu Salih, from Ibn Abbas, 
by Murrah from Ibn Masood and by other companions of the Prophet  (peace be upon him) that 
Adam did not have (in his grandchildren) a baby boy unless it was accompanied by a girl, so he married 
the male of a couple to the female of another, and the female of a couple to the male of another."
141,257,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/257,Making Up Sujud As-Sahw,"Question

 
If you have to do sujud-as-sahw, but you forget and do not do it, is the prayer valid? Is there a way to make up for it after the prayer has finished or must the whole prayer be repeated? What if you remember when you are praying sunnah - should you break your prayer?","If you forgot to do sujud as-sahw, you can make it up if you are still in the mosque and a long time has not passed. If a long time has passed or you broke your wudu or you left the mosque, you do not need to do the sujud and your prayer is still valid.","Praise be to Allah.Imam al-Mirdawi said in al-Insaf (2/154): The author– Ibn Qudamah – said that two conditions apply for sujud to be made up later:

It should be in the mosque
A long time should not have passed.

This is the right opinion, as he stated.
Imam Ahmad said: “He should do the sujud if the time that has passed is short, even if he has left the mosque.”
He also said: “He should do the sujud even if the time that has passed is long, or he has spoken or left the mosque. This is the opinion favoured by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah].” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94)
In Al-Rawd al-Murbi’ Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni’ (2/461) it says: 
“(If he forgets), i.e., he forgets to do the sujud as-sahw which should be done before the salam, (and he says salam), then he remembers, (he should do the sujud) and it is obligatory (if the time that has passed is short)… If he has said salam – and if a long time has passed according to what is ordinarily regarded as a long time, or he broke his wudu, or he left the mosque – he does not need to do the sujud, and his prayer is still valid.”
In Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (3/537), it says: 
“The phrase ‘If he forgets and says salam, he should still do the sujud if the time that has passed is short’ refers to the sujud that should be done before the salam, when he has already said the salam. He should do this sujud if the time that has passed is short, otherwise he no longer has to do it, and his prayer is still valid.
Examples:
A man may forget the first tashahhud, so he has to do sujud as-sahw before the salam, but he forgets and says the salam. If he remembers shortly afterwards, he should do the sujud, but if he remembers a long time afterwards, he no longer has to do it. This is why he said ‘He should do sujud if only a short time has passed. If he has left the mosque, he should not come back to do this sujud – he no longer has to do it, which is unlike when he has said salam before completing the prayer. In the latter case, he should come back and complete it, because he has omitted an obligatory act.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: Indeed, he should do the sujud , even if a long time has passed, because this will make up for what was missing. So when he remembers it, he should make up for it.
But the most likely opinion is that suggested by the author (may Allah have mercy on him), which is that if a long time has passed, the person no longer has to do the sujud, because sujud as-sahw is obligatory (wajib) either to make the prayer valid or it is wajib in the prayer as part of the prayer, so it is connected to the prayer and is not a separate prayer. We say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer, as soon as he remembers, let him pray.” (Reported by al-Bukhari (597) and Muslim (684) from the hadith of Anas) 
But we cannot use this evidence with regard to sujud as-sahw, because it is part of something else. If a person remembers soon afterwards, he should do it, otherwise he does not have to do it.”

Is it permissible (or obligatory) for sisters to pray in Jama‘a (with a leader) if there are no 
brothers? I’ve heard different views on this. 
Jazakumullahi khairan
wassalamu alaikum",,"Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh

It is permissible for women to pray in congregation among themselves. Their leader should stand in the 
middle of the row according to the narration regarding Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) which 
indicates that she used to lead women in prayer and would stand with them in the middle of the row. 
This has been narrated by ‘Abdur Razzaq in Al-Musannaf 3/141 and Daraqutni 1/404, and is authentic 
due to evidences for it.
Similarly Umm Al-Hasan narrated that she saw Umm Salmah (may Allaah be pleased with her) leading 
women in prayer while she stood in the middle of their row. This has been narrated by Ibn Abee 
Shaybah 2/88 and is also authentic due to other supporting evidences.
Ibn Qudamah has quoted the difference of opinion on whether congregation for women is 
recommended, and then says about their leader: “The one who leads them should stand in the middle of 
the row. We do not know of a difference of opinion on this among those who support that one women 
may lead others in congregation. Since it is recommended for the women to be covered, ….. standing in 
the middle of the row makes it a better covering for her from the sides.”(Al-Mughni, 2/202) 
The author of Al-Muhadhdhab (4/295) says: “It is sunnah that the leader of women in congregation 
stand in the middle of them as narrated about ‘Aa’ishah and Umm Salmah that they lead women and 
stood in the middle of their row.”

I have been told that a woman cannot put nailpolish because the wadoo is not done with it. How far is this true. Can she wear nailpolish (or any sort of makeup and perfo9rm her wadoo and salat.)",,"Praise be to Allah.Some powders and cosmetics that are used as makeup form a insulating layer over the skin and prevent water from reaching it, while others do not prevent water from reaching the skin.
If a cosmetic item insulates the skin (e.g., nailpolish as asked in the question) then it is not permissible to perform wudu or ghusl over it, for any act of worship that requires wudu or ghusl (such as prayer, etc.). Allaah the most glorified and Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning):
""O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and hands ."" Al-Maa'idah (5:6)
Washing implies that water must actually reach the part of the body being washed. Based on this observation, anything that prevents water from reaching the skin must be removed, otherwise purification will not be achieved, resulting in the prayer being void.
If the cosmetic item does not insulate the skin and does not prevent water from reaching it (e.g., dying by henna or similar things which do not insulate the skin), then wudu or ghusl may be performed with it.
Hence, dyes are of two type: the first is that which is waterproof, such as nailpolish, which must be removed before performing wudu or ghusl. The second is that which does not form an impermeable barrier to water, such as henna dye, and hence does not hurt the wudu or ghusl.
And Allah the most glorified and Almighty knows what is most correct and best.

I've a friend who likes to pray five times a day, and he likes to advise others to pray. He'll listen to whatever I talk about Islam.  Whenever I approach him he'll listen to me and I tell him, why can't you pray?  He told me he will, and I have heard this for the past ten to twenty years. One day I call him to pray and he gives excuses. I think that during prayer time his mind goes somewhere else; after that he thinks ""why can't I pray?"".  I am very tired of telling him.  I need advice.",,"Praise be to Allah.If your friend is mentally sound, then all you have mentioned about him indicates his disrespect of prayers.  If he means what he says, then he would perform his prayers.  His claim that he likes prayers is not truthful; if it were, then he would perform them accordingly.  In fact, the following verse from the Holy Qur'aan applies to such a recalcitrant and unobservant person (interpretation of the meaning):
""Then there has succeeded them a posterity who have neglected and lost the prayers, and followed their lusts; thus, they will face devastation (on the Day of Judgment, i.e., he will face Hell)."" Surat Maryam 19:59.
By completely ceasing to perform prayers, a person is judged to be a kaafir, based on several ahaadeeth of the Prophet  (peace be upon him), one of which is:
""The obligation and pact between us and them (the munaafiqeen, the hypocrites) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has indeed committed kufr (i.e., become a kaafir, a non-believer)."" (Tirmidhi, hadeeth #2621, and it is sahih)  The meaning here is that the hypocrites are guaranteed their security and immunity from being fought by the Muslims as long as they perform their prayers; if they abandon their prayers, then they are among the kuffaar, and are subject to being fought and killed in the war against them.  The Prophet  further says, ""What is between a person and committing shirk (associating partners with Allah) and kufr (disbelief) is abandoning the prayer."" (Sahih Muslim, #82)
The man in question, accordingly, is to be shunned--no one should eat the meat he slaughters; he is not to marry a Muslimah; he is not to inherit a Muslim relative; he is not allowed to enter Mecca; upon dying he is not entitled to Muslim burial rites such as the washing of the body or the shrouding or the funeral prayer; and his inheritance is to go to the the community fund and not to his inheritors. Thus, it is incumbent upon you to exert as much effort as possible in advising him and admonishing him concerning the gravity and danger of his crime, and of the punishment of Allah the Almighty.  If he persists and rejects your admonition, then you would not be wrong in abstaining from your friendship with him, until you can solicit help from other friends among those who accept guidance so that you may spend your time with them inviting him to Allah."

      other when you come to the sitting position Any-one leading the salaah and does not do the
      above, he's not aloowed to lead a salaah and we should not follow him in the salaah",,"Praise be to Allah.What your muallim (teacher) has told you, that in sujood the toes
    should be bent and should touch the ground, is correct. It is a proven part of the sunnah
    of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi that the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prostrated the tips
    of his toes would be facing the qiblah (Fath, no. 828).
    Abu Dawood reported from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi:
     he would bend his toes when he prostrated. (Reported by Abu
    Dawood, no. 716, Bab fi iftitaah al-salaah). The author of Awn
    al-Mabood Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood said: He would bend (yaftukh)
    his toes  the meaning of fatkh is to bend or flex, so he would bend his
    toes and point them towards the qiblah. (Awn al-Mabood,
    2/419). The hadeeth was reported by al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah p.
    142, 1411 AH edition [This book is also available in English under the title The
    Prophets Prayer Described  Translator].
    Pointing the toes towards the qiblah is sunnah and is encouraged, but
    if a person does not do it, his prayer or leadership of the prayer is still valid,
    especially as many people do not have the ability to flex their toes in the manner
    described. But everyone should put their toes on the ground when prostrating, because they
    are counted among the seven parts of the body on which we are commanded to prostrate. If a
    person lifts his feet off the ground when prostrating, and does not place the tips of his
    toes on the ground, then his prayer or leadership of the prayer is not valid.
With regard to the way one should sit between sujoods, two ways of
    doing this have been narrated from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him).
Keeping the right foot upright and sitting on the left foot, as was
        described in the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: He
        kept his right foot upright, and he pointed its toes towards the qiblah.
        This is the most well known way, and it is the way he sat most of the time.

Keeping both feet upright and sitting on the heels, as was described in
        the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: Sometimes he
        would rest on both his heels and the balls on his feet. (See Sifat
        al-Salaah by al-Albaani, p. 152). This is not the way of sitting that
        is forbidden.
      
    
    If a person who is praying puts one foot on top of the other and sits
    on them, he is doing something other than the sunnah, but his prayer or leadership of the
    prayer is still valid. In all cases, we should guide people towards the sunnah and teach
    them about it, because this is an important matter  how could it be otherwise? The
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Pray as you have seen
    me praying. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 631). And Allaah
    knows best."

In a discussion among Muslims, we were trying to arrive at a definition of ""love"" in Islam. Though we are all well aware of the love of Allah and our obligation to love both Him and His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), we wondered if there is a clear outline of love between humans (similar to the Christian ""brotherly love""...NOT the romantic variety). Some posited that ""love"" lies only within the family, all else is but respect/friend- ship/etc. Others questioned whether love is limited to spouses and/or children. Still others questioned if love can be conditional or not. One idea is that ""love"" (as the term is commonly used) may even be an 'innovation' of sorts, based on fairy tales and Christian philosophy. Many of us have looked in various sources to seek out an ""answer"", but no one has found a definitive answer as of yet... Can you help?",Love in Islam may be divided into specific love and general love. Specific love may be divided into permissible love and prohibited love. General love is of three types: 1- natural love; 2- love based on mercy and pity;  and 3- love based on acquaintance and friendship.,"Praise be to Allah.Types of love in Islam
I was very happy to hear that you and your fellow Muslim sisters are studying Islamic issues and trying to find out about Islamic views of love. No doubt, you and your sisters understand the importance of the scholars’ views and referring to them in matters of dispute. I will quote here a number of views about love, so that you will understand the matter better, in sha Allah
Love in Islam may be divided into specific love and general love.
Types of specific love
Specific love may be divided into types that are permissible and types that are prohibited.

Permissible love:


Love of Allah : This is the most important obligation, as it is the basis of Islam. By perfecting one’s love of Allah, one perfects their faith. If one’s love of Allah is lacking, then one’s Tawhid is also lacking. The evidence for this is the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

“But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)” [Al-Baqarah 2:165]
“Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allah guides not the people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24]
There are also other similar proofs in the Quran and Sunnah.
The love of Allah may also take the form of preferring what Allah loves and wants of His slave over what the slave himself might love and want. So he loves what Allah loves, hates what He hates, takes as friends or regards as enemies for His sake, and adheres to His laws. There are many ways to strengthen this type of love.

Love of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): This is also one of the most important duties of Islam. Indeed, faith is not complete until a person loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) more than he loves himself, as in the Hadiths:

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.” (Reported by Muslim, no. 44)
‘Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and he was holding the hand of ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him); ‘Umar said to him: O Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), you are dearer to me than everything except my own self. The Prophet (peace be and blessings upon him) said: No (that is not right), by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, (not) until I am dearer to you than your own self. ‘Umar said to him, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: Now (you are right), O Umar.” (Reported by Al-Bukhari, no. 6632).
This love is part of loving Allah and is manifested by following the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and giving precedence to his opinion over that of others.

Love of the Prophets and the believers: This is obligatory because loving Allah dictates that one should love the people who obey Him, namely, the Prophets and righteous people. The evidence for this is the Hadith: “Whoever loves for the sake of Allah (i.e., loves the people of faith for the sake of Allah ) … has perfected faith” 

Obedience to Allah is based on the love of Allah. Faith cannot be perfected except in this way, even if one has a lot of prayers and fasting to their credit. ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have witnessed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), none of us would think that he had more right to his own money than his Muslim brother.”

Forbidden love :


This includes love that constitutes Shirk (ascribing rivals to  Allah), which is when a person loves something instead of Allah or as much as Him. In such a case he has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the Shirk of love, and most people have taken things as rivals to Allah in love and glorification.
There are also types of forbidden love which do not go to the extent of Shirk, such as loving one's family, wealth, tribe, business or house, and preferring those things, in whole or in part, over doing the duties that Allah requires of him, such as Hijrah (migration for His sake), Jihad, etc. The evidence for this is the verse quoted above “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight . . . are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24])

Types of general love
General love is of three types:

Natural love, such as the love of a hungry person for food, or a thirsty person for water. This does not involve any kind of glorification, so it is permissible.
Love based on mercy and pity, such as the love of a father for his small child. This also involves no kind of glorification, so there is nothing wrong with it.
Love based on acquaintance and friendship, such as that between those who share a common profession, or scholars in the same field, or people one meets on a daily basis (such as fellow-commuters), or people one does business with, or travelling-companions. This type of appropriate love between people or between fellow Muslim brothers does not imply Shirk or associating anyone else in one's love for Allah.

                If a Muslim performs taraaweeh in a
      mosque, is it allowed for him to perform the night prayer at home?
      What is the Prophet's 
 (peace be upon him) manner in performing night prayer?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim performs Taraaweeh in
    congregation in the mosque, and wants to offer more prayers at home, he should pray a
    series of two-rak'ah prayers and should not repeat witr, because the Prophet 
 (Peace &
    Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: 
    ""There cannot be two witr prayers in one night."" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and
    others, and deemed saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami', 7565).
    Umm Salamah reported that the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used
    to pray two rak'ahs after witr. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and others, al-Sunan 433).
    Al-Nawawi said: ""The correct opinion is that he performed the two rak'ahs after witr
    sitting down, to demonstrate that this is permissible, and he did not do this all the
    time."" (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi).
    The sunnah is to make the last of one's night prayers an odd number of rak'ahs, as is
    reported (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 943). But if he has already prayed with the imaam, and
    wants to perform more prayers on his own and has time to do so - especially in the winter
    - he should do as is outlined above.
    As regards the number of rak'ahs to be performed in the night prayers, the Sunnah is to
    perform no more than eleven rak'ahs, because of the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah may
    Allaah be pleased with her, who said:
    "". . . He never used to pray more than eleven rak'ahs, in Ramadan or at any other
    time . . ."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1874).
    The best way to perform the night prayer is to pray two by two (rak'ahs), and to separate
    the two even rak'ahs of witr from the one rak'ah (i.e., not to join the three rak'ahs of
    witr). The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them
    both), who said: ""The Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to
    perform the night prayers two by two (rak'ahs), then he would end with a single
    rak'ah."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 940).
    This is the best-known way of performing the night prayers according to the Sunnah of the
    Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him); other ways are also known."
149,284,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/284,How a new Muslim should change his name,"Question

I was given the name Tyrone Anthony Parker at birth by my non-muslims parents. After taking shahada, I changed my name to Bilaal Faaruwq Abdus-Salaam. I have recently found out that I shouldn't have left my family name and I plan on returning to it. If my parents tell me to return to my given name (Tyrone-has pagan origins ; Anthony-means flourishing) do I have to do it?",,"Praise be to Allah.For the one whom Allaah has guided to Islam, it is sufficient for him to choose an Islamic first name for himself and to keep his fathers name or surname, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not command the Sahaabah to change their fathers and grandfathers names when they embraced Islam. However, he did change the first names of those who had names with forbidden or undesirable meanings. Because your first name has pagan origins, your changing it to another name, such as Bilaal, is proper and correct. But you should keep the rest of your name and surname as it is; this will please your parents. May Allah guide them, and may He give us and you strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
150,286,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/286,Ruling on Muslim    women working as nurses and doctors,"Question

 
My wife is studing to become a nurse at a University, is it lawful to: -examine patients(male or female) and give them baths which are apart of the class projects.
-examine men as a nurse in non-emergency situations at a non-muslim hospital.
-work at a home for the mentally ill where the co-workers are male and the patients are also.",,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman finds that she has to work because of necessity, she is permitted to work outside the home, as is indicated by the fact that the two daughters of Shu’ayb used to water the sheep, and the story of Asma’ bint Abi Bakr working outside the home. If a woman is widowed with children, and has no breadwinner and is receiving no money from the Bayt al-Maal (treasury), it is permissible for her to earn a living. Although we say that a woman is permitted to work outside the home when it is necessary, she should nevertheless do only the work she needs to do in order to meet her needs. If a woman has professional skills which not every woman possesses, and which are needed by other woman and society as a whole, then it is permissible for her to practice her profession outside the home, so long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah and has the permission of her legal (shar’i) guardian. The evidence that it is permissible for the woman to work outside the home in a field where there is a need for her work, as long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah, is to be seen in the fact that at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), midwives used to attend women in labour, and skilled women used to practice circumcision, and he did not condemn them for doing so. It is also known that Rufaydah al-Ansaariyyah used to treat the wounded in her tent, which had been set up in the mosque for that purpose. She was very skilled in treating the sick, and her work was done with the knowledge and express permission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Sa’d ibn Mu’aadh was transferred to her tent for treatment. This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to practice her profession outside the home, and by analogy we may deduce that it is permissible for a female doctor to open a clinic outside her home for the treatment of women and children. By doing this, she is fulfilling the duty of fard kifaayah (a duty falling on the entire community – if some people fulfil it, responsibility is lifted from the rest, otherwise all will be held accountable. Translator). Such clinics make it easy for sick women to come to a female doctor, hence they no longer have to uncover their ‘awrah before a male doctor when they need treatment.
But this permission is given on the condition that this work does not affect her duties towards her own home, husband and children, and that she has her husband’s permission, because these duties are her individual duties (fard ‘ayn), which take precedence over her responsibilities towards the community (fard kifaayah). When there is any conflict, her individual duties must come first.
(Al-Mufassal by ‘Abd al-Kareem, 4/272).
Another hadeeth which describes Muslim women at the beginning of Islam practising a profession was narrated by Hafsah, concerning a woman who used to treat the wounded. Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, reported in his Saheeh that Hafsah said: “A woman came and stayed at the fort of Bani Khalaf, and told us about her sister. Her sister’s husband used to go out on military campaigns with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He had been on twelve campaigns, and she (his wife) had accompanied him on six. She said, ‘We used to treat the wounded and take care of the sick…’”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 313).
But a woman’s work as a nurse or doctor is regulated by the rules indicated in other Islamic texts. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, commenting on the above hadeeth, mentioned some of these conditions: “What we learn from this hadeeth is that a woman is allowed to offer medical treatment to a non-mahram man (one to whom she is not related), so long as this takes the form of bringing medicine to him, for example, or other forms of indirect treatment (i.e. with no touching or direct contact involved) – except in cases where it is necessary and there is no fear of temptation (such as in an emergency situation or in the event of a disaster).”
If a woman works in complete hijaab, without touching a male patient, or being alone with him in any way, and as long as there is no fear that she may be the cause of temptation or be tempted herself, and she is not neglecting a more essential duty such as taking care of her husband or children, and she has the permission of her guardian, then it is permissible for her to work. In principle, men should be treated by male doctors and nurses, and women by female doctors and nurses. There should be no mixing of the sexes in medical treatment, except when it is necessary and as long as there is no fear of temptation.

                Assalam alaikum,
The question has arisen due to many needy Muslims who are being thrown 
out of schools due to lack of tuition. There are many Muslims who have bank 
accounts which give interest, and they have not been using it as interest is 
haram. What should one do with the interest. Should he leave it to the bank 
or can it be used for such case as paying the tuition to the non Islamic 
institutions ?
Please give valid reasons. This question is very important and urgent as the 
academic term has just started and funds are not available. 
Jazakawallahu Kheiran,",,"Praise be to Allah.and may His peace and blessings be upon His Messenger 
Muhammad 
 and on his family and companions.
To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani , May Allah safeguard you , Judge of 
Nairobi - Kenya 
May Allaah’s peace and blessings be upon you.
I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest 
money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your 
country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what 
scholars have mentioned: 
If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must 
neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, 
drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting 
hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales 
taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the 
purification of one’s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because 
Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and 
good.
This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and 
needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of 
Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. 
Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc… Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students 
studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of 
expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by 
unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and 
do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is 
considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to 
whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is 
considered as lost money that no one owns.
Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims.

earning forbidden money"", Al-Fawzaan."

2- The disbelief of the disbelieving People of the Scripture, that include Jews and Christians, in our times does not expel them from being People of the Scripture.","Praise be to Allah.Who are the Ahlul Kitab? 
Ahlul Kitab (People of the Book) consist of both believers and disbelievers, as indicated in the Quran, where Allah the Almighty mentions the disbelievers among them (interpretation of the meaning):
""O people of the Scripture!: Why do you disbelieve in the verses [about Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)] of Allah, while you (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth)."" (Al ‘Imraan, 3:70)
And:
""Say: O people of the Scripture! Why do you stop those who believe from the path of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do"". (Al ‘Imran, 3:99)
And Allah, the Almighty, said about the believers among them, making clear the difference between them and the aforementioned (interpretation of the meaning):
""Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid evil and they hasten in good works; and they are among the righteous. And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knows well those who are the pious."" (Al ‘Imran, 3:113-115)
These people also believe in our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Quran which was revealed to him as mentioned (approximate translation of meanings is):
""And there are, certainly, among the people of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They do not sell the Verses of Allah for a little price, for them is a reward from their Lord. Surely, Allah is swift in account."" (Al ‘Imran, 3:199)
Are modern Christians among Ahul Kitab?
The disbelief of the disbelieving People of the Scripture, that include Jews and Christians, in our times does not expel them from being People of the Scripture.

If a person enters the Masjid during one of the times when making prayer is makruh (e.g. sunrise, sunset, zawal,...), does he still have to pray two rak`ahs of Tahiyyat Al-masjid?","The correct opinion is that you can pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid at all times, even after Fajr and after ‘Asr because of the general applicability of the hadith “When any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak`ahs.”","Praise be to Allah.There are differences among the scholars concerning this matter. The correct opinion is that Tahiyyat al-masjid is permitted at all times, even after Fajr and after ‘Asr, because of the general applicability of the hadith “When any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak`ahs.” (Sahih – agreed upon)  
Tahiyyat al-masjid is one of the prayers that is done for a specific reason, like Salat al-Tawaf (prayer done after circumambulating the Ka`bah) and Salat al-Kusuf (prayer at the time of an eclipse). The correct view concerning all of these is that it is permissible to do these at times when prayer is generally disallowed, like making up missed prayers. 
Concerning Salat al-Tawaf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Banu ‘Abd Manaf, do not prevent anyone from circumambulating this House and praying at any time of night or day.” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a sahih isnad)

Jazakallahulkhairun.",,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah.
The division of the inheritance in the case you mention is as follows: 
An eighth of it is due to the wife, since the father had children, as indicated in the verse (intrepretation of 
the meaning):
""And if you have children, then to them (the wives) is due an eighth of what you have left behind, 
after [paying] any amount specified in the will or any loans due."" (surat al-Nisaa':12).
The remaining seven-eighths (7/8) is divided into 11 equal portions. Each male among his children is 
entitled to two portions and each female one portion, as per Allaah's specification (interpretation of the 
meaning):
""Allaah has enjoined upon you with regards to your children that the [entitlement of] the male is 
twice that of the female."" (al-Nisaa':11). 
For example, let's suppose the man in question left property and wealth with a total worth of $88,000, 
and he does not owe payment on any loans and did not specify any special requests or instructions to 
make particular donations in his will. Thus, the division would be as follows: 
For the wife, an eighth, 1/8 of 88,000 which is $11,000. 
The remaining 77,000 is divided into 11 equal portions, 1/11 * 77,000 = $7,000

We have asked an alm he said she can go with her brother in-law which is also her first cousin. As long as his wife is there which she will be cause she's going too. Is this permissable in Islam because I still have my doubts.",,"Praise be to Allah.One of the ways in which Islam protects women is that it requires a woman to travel with a mahram, to protect her from those who have bad intentions and to help her, because of her weakness, in facing the arduous trials of travelling. A woman is not permitted to travel without a mahram because of the hadith narrated by Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: A woman should absolutely not travel unless she has a mahram with her. A man stood up and said, O Messenger of Allah, I have enlisted in such-and-such a military campaign, and my wife has set out for Hajj. He said, Go and do Hajj with your wife.(al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 3006).
What indicates that a mahram is obligatory is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded this man to give up the idea of jihaad (on this occasion), even though he had enlisted for a campaign and his wife was travelling for the purpose of worship, not for some frivolous or suspicious reason. In spite of all this, he told him to go and do Hajj with his wife.
The ulamaa have listed five conditions for a person to be considered a mahram. He should be male, Muslim, adult, and of sound mind, and he should be a relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a father, brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, father in law, mothers husband or brother through radaaah (breastfeeding), etc. (as opposed to relatives to whom marriage is temporarily forbidden, such as a sisters husband, paternal aunts husband, maternal aunts husband).
On this basis, the husbands brother and the son of a paternal or maternal uncle are not mahrams, so it is not permitted for her to travel with them.

161,319,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/319,Maximum Period of Nifas,"Question

My Question About purity for women after childbirth. My wife kept bleeding after our child birth for exactly 56 days, that is 16 days more than usual. Could you give us details about what she should consider those extra 16 days. Some say that it might be her menses, some said it is Istihadah. Others said it is a collection of menses and Istihadah. We have Sheikh Mohmmed ibn Saleh `Uthaymin book ""Ad-dema'a At-Tabi`iyah"", but we didn't really understand exactly what he means.How do we know that it is her menses or it is not?","Some scholars say that the maximum period of Nifas is 40 days, others say it is 60 days and some say there is no limit to the maximum number of days a woman can be in a state of Nifas. The most predominant opinion is that the maximum period is 40 days.","Praise be to Allah.There is a dispute amongst the religious scholars regarding the longest period of Nifas (the post-natal bleeding period). Some scholars say it is forty (40) days , others say it is sixty (60) days and some say there is no limit to the maximum number of days a woman can be in a state of Nifas. The most predominant opinion is that the maximum period is forty (40) days according to what is narrated by Umm Salamah. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said ""The Nufasa' (a woman in Nifas) used to continue to be in childbed for forty days at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).""
At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) reported: ""It is unanimously agreed upon among religious scholars from the Companions and the Successors that the Nufasa' does not pray for forty days unless she sees blood stoppage before the end of the forty days period . She should then perform Ghusl and she resumes praying. 
The majority of the religious scholars say that a woman does pray even if she continues to notice blood after the forty days period expires and this is the opinion of the majority of jurists among whom Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad and Is-haq."" (Sunan At-Tirmidhi Hadith # 139)
The same Hadith is also reported by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Ad-Darami and is classified as good by Al-Albani in Irwa' Al-Ghalil (201). Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) has supported this narration by another Hadith reported by Abu Dawud narrated by Umm Salama (may Allah be pleased with her) who said, ""A Prophet's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wife used to remain in (a state of) Nifas for forty nights and the Prophet would not ask her to make up the prayers she missed during the period of Nifas"".
Ibn Majah also reported that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had specified a period of forty days for the Nufasa' unless she achieves purity before that."" (Irwa' Al Ghalil, 223-222/1)
Therefore, if a woman experiencing post-childbirth bleeding spent forty days and she still sees blood, then we consider this blood as Istihadah (irregular bleeding outside menses) which does not stop a woman from performing prayer nor fasting, unless the end of the forty days coincides with the regular menstrual period; in this case she would consider this blood as menstrual blood.

My I have read in another Islamic website that you shouldn't play cards even if you aren't gambling. If this is true, I don't understand why, if you are just playing for the fun of it. If you would please explain.",,"Praise be to Allah.The reasons are:


Wasting of time in something which has no benefit in this life nor in the hereafter.


This game of cards is based on the idea of gambling, and it resembles playing with dice, which is clearly prohibited in Islaam, as related in the authentic hadeeth of the Prophet :


""Whoever plays with dice, would (resemble) one who has tainted his hand with the flesh and blood of a pig,"" narrated by Muslim (2260).


The playing cards include pictures of creations with a soul (the Jack and Queen ).


The rancor, enmity, bitterness, and/or ill-feeling which may occur between the players (shahnaa' wa-baghdaa').


The game promotes cheating, deception, and trickery (ghish wa-tahaayul).


It distracts from the worship of Allah, and from salaat. Even if one performs salaat on time, and with the congregation in the Masjid, how would he escape the hadeeth of the Prophet :


""Everything other than remembering Allah is (considered) wasteful play except four: a man humoring his wife, a man training his horse, a man walking between targets (learning archery), and man learning swimming,"" narrated by An-Nasaa'i and authenticated by Al-Albani (Sahih Al-Jami' 4534)."

                My wife's mother has in effect cut herself off from her daughter in recent times. Whilst there 
was some form of communication it was often quite turbulent and heated. My wife has tried a 
number of times to re-establish contact yet her mother refuses, quite stubbornly, to reply. We 
are both reverts and have often felt that our acceptance of the religion has played some part in 
her mother's negative attitude. I would be grateful if you could advise us on what me might 
possibly do to rectify this situation.
Jazak Allahu Khairan",,"Praise be to Allah.,
The reactions of non-muslim mothers towards their children's embracement of Islam varies. Some mothers 
are peaceful and passive considering this as a personal matter which does not affect the relationship 
between the mother and her son or daughter. In such cases more piety by the child towards his or her 
mother will make the mother admire and respect Islam.
Other mothers adopts a more stubborn approach at the beginning but the mother finally gives in and 
accepts the new religion as a fact of life after she sees the child's determination and persistence which could 
lead the mother herself to embrace Islam.
In the third case we find that some mothers are constantly stubborn to the extent that she might hurt and 
oppress her son or daughter. Usually such mothers are blindly prejudice because they consider that her son 
or daughter had gone astray by leaving the faith of his fathers and ancestors and she must do something to 
help go back to the right path (according to the mother).
The following are three stories that took place at the time of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon 
Him, that involved three of the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) 
which illustrates the reactions of their mothers after they embraced Islam:
Story #1
On the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said ""My mother came to visit me one day. At 
that time she was still a polytheist and there was a pledge between the Prophet, Peace and 
Blessings be Upon Him, and Quraish (one of the great tribes in Arabia that lived in Mecca in 
the pre Islamic Period of Ignorance who used to enjoy great spiritual and financial powers). I 
requested the Prophet's, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, religious verdict and said: Oh 
Prophet of Allah, my mother came to visit me, seeking my help; should I keep a good 
relationship with her? Yes, keep a good relation with her said the Prophet, Peace and 
Blessings be Upon Him:. Reported by Bukhari and Muslim, and this narration is listed in Sahih 
Muslim under # 1003.
In another version narrated by Ahmad, on the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said "" My 
mother came to visit me when she was still a polytheist and she was living amongst Quraish. 
She was desirous, meaning in need, so I asked the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon 
Him, and said: Oh Prophet of Allah my mother came to me and she is a polytheist and she 
needs help. Should I keep a good relationship with her? He said yes maintain a good 
relationship with her.
Story #2
On the authority of Abu-Huraira, who said: I used to call my mother to Islam when she was 
still a polytheist. One day, while I was calling her she mentioned something about the Prophet
, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that I detested. So I went to see the Prophet, Peace 
and Blessings be Upon Him, while crying and told him: I used to call my mother to Islam and 
she would refuse. I called her today and she mentioned something about you that I detested. 
Please invoke the blessings and guidance of Allah on her. Then the Prophet, Peace and 
Blessings be Upon Him, said: O Great Allah guide the mother of Abu-Huraira. So I left full of 
hope because of the Prophet's supplication for my mother. When I reached home I found that 
the door was partially closed. My mother heard my footsteps and said: Stay still Abu-Huraira, 
then I heard the water running; he added my mother performed body ablution, put on her 
cloths and hurriedly opened the door without her head-cover and said: ""None has the right to 
be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, is the 
Messenger of Allah"". I went back to the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, crying 
of joy and told him: I am bringing you good news; Allah answered your prayers and guided the 
mother of Abu-Huraira. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, praised and 
glorified Allah and said: this is good. I said: Oh Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me 
and my mother beloved by Allah's believing slaves and make us love them. The Prophet, 
Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: Oh Allah, make this little slave of Yours and his 
mother (meaning Abu-Huraira and his mother) become beloved by your believing slaves and 
make the believers love them. Ever since, there was not a believer who heard of me, even 
without seeing me, that did not love me. Reported by Muslim in Sahih Muslim (Muslim 
Authentic volumes) under # 2491.
Story # 3
On the authority of Saa'd (Ibn Abi Waqas May Allah be pleased with him) who said that 
verses of the Qur'an revealed his story. He said Um Saa'd (his mother) swore not to talk to 
him ever nor eat or drink until he renounces Islam. She said: You claim that Allah commanded 
you to obey your parents. I am your mother and I order you to do this ( to renounce Islam). 
He said: She stayed with nothing to eat or drink for three days until she fainted because of 
strain. Then one of her other sons named Umarah gave her water to drink. And she started to 
imprecate against Saa'd, then Allah revealed this verse in the Qur'an, which translates to the 
meaning of And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they 
strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no 
knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to 
do Verse 29:8 - Surah 29, Al Ankabut. This Hadith is narrated by Imam Ahmad in his 
Musnad and in Sahih Muslim in his Sahih under # 1748.
Also, Allah revealed another verse in the Qur'an, which translates to:
""But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that if which you have no 
knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him 
who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you 
what you used to do""( 31:15 - Surah Luqman).
Based on the above stories one can determine how to deal with a non believing mother and can draw the 
following significant conclusions:
The importance of good presentation of Islam to the non believing mother and to try to kindly 
persuade her and to strive to convince her as Abu Huraira did (story # 1)

Continue to do good to the non believing mother and to remember that her disbelief does not justify 
disobedience by the son or daughter and that doing her good does not contradict with your innocence 
of her as a non believer, on the contrary as it is stated in Verse 31:15 above, Allah has commanded us 
to treat the non believing parents kindly even if they strive to make their child a polytheist because of 
their rights as parents hoping that they will embrace Islam.

Continue to sincerely pray and supplicate for the non believing mother hoping that Allah may guide 
her, as evident in Abu Huraira's story (story #2).

The divine guidance of Allah may come after continuous strive by the child and strong objection of 
the mother as in Abu Huraira's story, therefore the son should never surrender or give up but should 
continue to pray and supplicate for the non believing mother.

Regardless of how hard does the non believing mother strive to make the son renounces Islam, and 
the pressure she will exercise against her son such as refusing to eat or invoking upon him , the son 
should never surrender or give in nor should he retrocede away from the righteous path as one of the 
Sahaba said to his non believing mother in a similar situation: :If you had one hundred (100) souls and 
it all left your body one after the other I will never give up my religion (Islam)"".

It seems that the mother in question deliberately oppresses her daughter through estrangement which makes 
her emotional torn but that should never weaken the muslim or shake his faith and belief in his religion. 
There is no objection to make the non believing mother understand that you are not going to retrocede , 
however she (the mother) can kindly ask for anything and she will be immediately answered to it except for 
giving up this religion.
We ask Allah to quickly guide her to the righteous path and give you patience to call her to Islam and lead 
you to the righteous and correct way."
164,324,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/324,Difference Between Punishments and Trials,"Question

                Allah mentions in the Quran that when an evil befalls us it is due to what our own hands have earned. Also our beloved Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a hadeeth (report) that the most tried are the Prophets, then those in piety after those. So therefore in our day to day life when things go wrong in our lives, how do we decide whether it is due to our sinfulness or that Allah loves us  and therefore sends a trial upon us?",,"Praise be to Allah.
    Punishments are what happen to people in 
    return for their evil deeds. Trials are tests which are sent to try people, 
    and people may be tested by good things or by bad.

    Concerning punishments, Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Whatever of good reaches you, is from 
    Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself…” 

    [al-Nisa 4:79]

    Concerning the phrase “is from yourself”, 
    Qatadah said: “[It means] the punishment is for you, O son of Adam, because 
    of your sin.” Abu Salih said that “whatever of evil befalls you, is 
    from yourself” means “because of your sin, and I [Allah] am the One 
    Who decreed it for you.” (Tafseer Ibn 
    Katheer).

    Allah also says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what 
    your hands have earned. And He pardons much.” 

    [al-Shoora 42:30]

    Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, 
    said: “[It means] whatever misfortune happens to you, O people, is because 
    of evil deeds that you have already done, and ‘He pardons much’ refers to 
    evil deeds – He does not punish you for them but He pardons them. ‘And if 
    Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, he would not leave a 
    moving (living) creature on the surface of the earth…’ [Fatir 35:45 – 
    interpretation of the meaning].” 

    Concerning trials, the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If Allah loves a people, He tries 
    them, and whoever has patience will have patience, and whoever is anxious 
    will be anxious.” (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad; Saheeh 
    al-Jami’, 1706).

    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) also said: “The extent of the reward will be in accordance with 
    the extent of the trial. If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever 
    is content will have contentment, and whoever is angry will have anger.” 
    (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2320; Saheeh al-Jami’, 2210).

    The following outlines how one may tell 
    whether a given event is a punishment or a trial:

    If the misfortune results from doing an act 
    of obedience to Allah, such as being wounded in jihad, or losing money when 
    migrating for the sake of Allah, or losing a job because of becoming a 
    Muslim or increasing one’s commitment to Islam, then this is a trial. 
    Whoever bears it with patience will be rewarded, but if one reacts angrily 
    then one will earn the wrath of Allah. If the misfortune results from sin, 
    such as sexually-transmitted diseases or illnesses caused by drinking 
    alcohol and taking drugs, and so on, then this is the kind of punishment 
    that comes in this world (as opposed to being deferred until the Hereafter). 
    If the misfortune is connected neither to a good deed nor a sin – such as 
    other kinds of diseases and sicknesses, losing a child, or failing in 
    business – then it depends on the person’s situation. If he is good and 
    devout, it is a trial, and if he is sinful, it is a punishment.

    The misfortune may be a punishment to atone 
    for sins, or it may be a trial aimed at raising a person’s status and 
    increasing his hasanat (good deeds/rewards) – this may be determined 
    by whether a person is obedient or disobedient. A person should not praise 
    himself, rather he should criticize himself for his shortcomings and strive 
    to attain perfection. He will benefit from misfortunes in any case, if he 
    has patience and hopes for reward. 

    And Allah knows best."
165,326,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/326,He is in love with a girl but    cannot marry her,"Question

                I am currently in a sitaution that may be common among the muslim community. I have met a wonderful Muslim XXX girl six months ago, I am XXX. We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other. Everything about our relationship has been wonderful.I feel Allah has brought us together. We have talked about marriage and both agree we want to spend our lives together.Now here is where the problem begins.Her father would not agree to marry her to anyone but a XXX that he has chosen in an arranged marriage.Even if she doesnt love him. I have spoken to her mother and she really likes me.She tried to talk to her husband but he wouldnt listen.Now it looks like her dad will arrange a marriage for her soon. What can we DO!!!I dont want to lose her I love her soooo much.Is there anything we can do?",,"Praise be to Allah.besides Whom there is nobody to praise when calamity strikes.
My dear brother, you should realize that no calamity befalls a person except because of sin, and it cannot be lifted except by repentance.
Despite all the hardship you are facing and the intense pain you are feeling, you still have to think about the root of the problem and understand the shar’i ruling on it and learn a lesson from what has happened. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:79]
it comes from yourself because you gave yourself free rein in starting this forbidden relationship and getting to know this girl in a manner that is not approved of in sharee’ah, and because you indulged in absolute freedom in an environment that is far removed from the laws of Allaah.
Don’t you see that our Lord is truly Wise and All-Knowing when He forbids men to deliberately look at non-mahram women or to touch them or be alone with them or take them as friends? Allaah knows that this leads to haraam things whether it is immoral actions of varying decrees or falling in love – which is the serious and fatal disease from which you are suffering because of your sin. You have become one of its victims, suffering its pain and choking on it.
You have been very frank in describing this disease from its onset, and how you fell into this devilish trap, when you said in your question: “I have met a wonderful Muslim girl six months ago... We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other.”
But you mention that you feel that Allaah has led you to one another. If you mean that this has happened by the will and decree of Allaah, then this is correct. Even Iblees exists by the will and decree of Allaah. But if you meant that Allaah decreed this because He likes it and approves of it, (this is wrong, because) Allaah does not approve of anything that is haraam. Just because something happens does not mean that Allaah likes it or approves of it. Allaah decrees good and evil for reasons which only He knows.
If you say now that what has happened has happened, and cannot be changed, so what can we do about this father who is standing in the way of these two lovers who want to get married?
I would say that there is nothing wrong with making efforts – in halaal ways, of course – to persuade this father, such as bringing mediators from within the family, or the imaam of the Islamic Centre where the father goes, and so on, and praying earnestly to Allaah to make this girl part of your lot in life if this is good for you and for her. If what you want happens, then praise be to Allaah, Who is the Giver of bounty and blessings.
But if all attempts fail, mediation does not work and the wind blows in the way that the sailor does not like (i.e., things do not go the way you hoped), then you should know that from the point of view of sharee’ah you can never marry this girl without the consent of her guardian – which is her father in the case – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.”
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1102, and by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2709). The marriage contract will not be valid even if it was approved by jaahili courts and kaafir judges.
It is impossible for running away with this girl to be a valid solution, either in this world or in the next.
We must also ask some other questions raised by your situation, such as: what is your commitment to Islam – do you pray regularly, for example? Does she adhere to the hijaab prescribed by sharee’ah? What is the attitude of your own family to the idea of your marrying this girl?
Finally, you must realize that you will have to forget about her if she marries someone else. In that case, you should not waste your life regretting losing her. You never know where good may come from. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.”
[al-Baqarah 2:216]
What has happened is a mistake of which you are going to bear the bitter consequences, but you have to be sincere towards Allaah and strive to repent and turn back to Him. If this girl is not destined to be your lot in life, then we ask Allaah to compensate you with someone better than her. “Verily, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him, and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the reward of the muhsinoon (good-doers) to be lost.” [Yoosuf 12:90 – interpretation of the meaning]."
166,329,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/329,Is Masturbation Haram in Islam?,"Question

I have a question which I am shy to ask but another sister who has come to Islam recently wants an answer to and I do not have an answer (with evidence from the Quran and Sunnah). I hope you can help and I hope Allah will forgive me if it is inappropriate but as Muslims we should never be shy in seeking knowledge. Her question was ""Is it permissible in Islam to masturbate?""
May Allah increase us all in knowledge!",Masturbation (for both men and women) is haram (forbidden) in Islam based on evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah. See the detailed answer for 13 tips on how to give up masturbation.,"Praise be to Allah.
Is masturbation haram in Islam?
Masturbation (for both men and women) is haraam (forbidden) in Islam based on the following evidence:
Prohibition of masturbation in the Quran
Al-Imam Shafi'i stated that masturbation is forbidden based on the following verses from the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
{And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.} (Al-Muminun 23:5-7)
Here the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts (including masturbation) except for the wives or what their right hand possesses. {And whoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.} 
Some scholars used as evidence the ayah (in meaning),
{And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His bounty.} (Al-Nur 24:33)
This verse also clearly orders whoever does not have the financial means to marry to keep himself chaste and be patient in facing temptations (including masturbation) until Allah enriches them of His bounty.
Prohibition of masturbation in the Sunnah
'Abdullaah ibn Mas’ud said, ""We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while we were young and had no wealth whatsoever. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said, 'O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.'"" (Al-Bukhari 5066)
The hadeeth orders men who are not able to marry to fast despite the hardship encountered in doing so, and not to masturbate despite the ease with which it can be done.
There is additional evidence that can be cited to support this ruling on masturbation, but due to the limited space we will not go through them here. 
Tips on how to give up masturbation
As for curing/treating the habit of masturbation, we recommend the following suggestions:
1. The motive to seek a cure for this problem should be solely following Allah's orders and fearing His punishment.
2. A permanent and quick cure from this problem lies in marriage as soon as the person is able, as shown in the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) hadeeth.
3. Keeping oneself busy with what is good for this world and the Hereafter is essential in breaking this habit before it becomes second nature after which it is very difficult to rid oneself of it.
4. Lowering the gaze (from looking at forbidden things such as pictures, movies etc.) will help suppress the desire before it leads one to commit the haram (forbidden). Allah orders men and women to lower their gaze as shown in the following two verses and in the Prophet's hadith.
{Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is all-aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) ..... } (24: 30-31)
Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Do not follow a casual (unintentional) look (at forbidden things) with another look."" (Al-Tirmidhi, 2777) This is a general instruction by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to abstain from all that may sexually excite a person because it might lead him/her to commit the haram (forbidden).
5. Using one's available leisure time in worshipping Allah and increasing religious knowledge.
6. Being cautious not to develop any of the medical symptoms that may result from masturbation such as weak eyesight, weak nervous system, and/or back pain. More importantly, feelings of guilt and anxiety that can be complicated by missing obligatory prayers because of the need to shower (ghusl) after every incidence of masturbation, especially in the winter, and the invalidating of the fast.
7. Avoiding the illusion that some youth have that masturbation is permissible because it prevents them from committing illegal sexual acts such as fornication or even homosexuality, while they may not be at the gates of that immorality to begin with.
8. Strengthening one's willpower and not surrendering to the shaytan, and avoiding spending time alone as recommended by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he said ""Do not spend the night alone"" Ahmad, 6919.
9.  Following the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) aforementioned hadeeth and fasting when possible, because fasting will temper one's sexual desire and keep it under control. However, one should not overreact and swear by Allah not to return to the act because if one does not honor one's promise, one would be facing the consequences of not living up to one's oath to Allah. Also, note that medication to diminish one's sexual desire is strictly prohibited because it might permanently affect one's sexual ability.
10. Trying to follow the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) recommendation concerning the etiquette of getting ready for bed, such as reading the well-known supplications, sleeping on the right side, and avoiding sleeping on the belly (the Prophet-peace and blessings be upon him- forbade sleeping on the belly).
11. Striving hard to be patient and chaste, because persistence will eventually, Allah willing, lead to attaining those qualities as second nature, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) explains in the following hadith:
""Whoever seeks chastity Allah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks help from none but Allah, He will help him, and whoever is patient He will make it easy for him, and no one has ever been given anything better than patience."" Al-Bukhari:1469.
12. If one falls into this sin, they must hasten to repent, asking forgiveness from Allah, doing good deeds, and not losing hope and feeling despair; these are all prerequisites to curing this problem. Note that losing hope is one of the major sins punishable by Allah.
13. Finally, Allah is the Most Merciful and He always responds to whoever calls on Him. So, asking for Allah's forgiveness and help will be accepted, by His will.

What is Islam's view on the parents' (especially the father's) responsibility to educate their children? Additionally, what type or manner of education is most Islamically correct (i.e. private or public school etc.)?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. Praise be to Allaah.
No doubt that a child's education is one of life's necessities, and as such spending to achieve it is obligatory on the parents. However, the level of education that a Muslim should provide for his children is not necessarily the highest level possible. This is because a child can lead a perfectly normal life with only, for example, high school education.
And as for whether private schools are better than public schools from the shari'ah (Islamic jurisprudence) standpoint, I do not think that there is a general rule by which we can favor one schooling system over the other. It all depends on the specifics of each individual case when assessed with respect to curricula, teachers' skills, and the school district credibility.
Wallaahu a'lam. And Allaah knows best."
168,333,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/333,Praying in a moving vehicle,"Question

 
Can we pray salat while in a moving car that's because there is no place to stop and pray?",,"Praise be to Allah.Performing prayers at the right time is a trust and an obligation, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
""Verily, al-Salaat (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours."" [al-Nisaa' 4:103].
 
Delaying the prayer past its appointed time is a grave major sin, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""So woe unto those performers of salaat (prayers) (hypocrites), who delay their salaat from their stated fixed times."" [al-Maa'oon 107:4-5]
 
Some scholars state that the person who deliberately misses one prayer and leaves it until the appointed time is over, with no excuse, is a kaafir. Claiming that one cannot find a place to pray is not a valid excuse, because either one is living on the face of the earth or not, and if one is living on the face of the earth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The (whole) earth has been made a mosque (or a place of prayer) and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man of my ummah may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 335)
 
 
According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: ""The (whole) earth has been made good for me, a means of purification and a mosque (or place of prayer); so wherever a man may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray wherever he is."" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 521)
 
The entire world is a suitable place to prostrate oneself; the scholars have made no exceptions except very few, such as graveyards and lavatories. Wherever a Muslim is when the time for prayer comes, he should pray: in a mosque, if possible, or else in a hallway or park, on a sidewalk or in a parking lot, or in a corner of a store. Even if one can find no other place than a church, it is permissible to pray in it.
 
As far as praying on board means of transportation is concerned, then it is possible to pray there so long as the necessary conditions of prayer are fulfilled, or else one can wait until one gets out of the vehicle. If waiting means that the time for the prayer will pass, then you should pray in the best way that you can. Let us assume, for example, that you are in a car or train where there is no place to pray, you cannot stop and pray at the side of the road, and the time for that prayer is running out. In such a situation, the Muslim should pray in the best way that he can, even if he is sitting in his seat and even if he is not facing the qiblah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can"" [al-Taghaabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If I have commanded you to do something, do as much of it as you can."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 7288)
 
An exception to be above is naafil (supererogatory) prayers offered when riding a camel, which is permissible even if one cannot get down or if one is not facing the qiblah. This is known from the report of Ibn 'Umar, who said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray when travelling on his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, and he would gesture with his head to indicate the movements of the night prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray witr on his camel too."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 945)
 
Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray voluntary (nafl) prayers when riding on his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, when he came from Makkah to Madeenah."" Then Ibn 'Umar recited this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ""And to Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces, there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne)"" [al-Baqarah 2:115]
 
Ibn 'Umar said: ""It was concerning this that this aayah was revealed."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2883; he said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth)
 
We should not forget to point out here that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries sometimes delay or abandon their prayers for another, completely different, reason, which is that they feel too embarrassed to pray in front of the kuffaar in public or open places, or they are afraid that they will make fun of them and regard them as odd. This is a serious mistake. How can a Muslim feel embarrassed about proclaiming the truth and worshipping openly, hastening to fulfil the command of Allah at the time when Allah has said it is to be done? This matter has been dealt with in a similar question on this website (see question # 980). We ask Allah to help us all to remember Him, to be grateful to Him and to worship Him properly."
169,334,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/334,Why Do Muslims Shave Babies’ Heads?,"Question

Is the act of shaving a newborn baby's head rooted in Islam? What is the purpose of doing this, and is it referenced in the Quran?","Muslims shave babies’ heads because it removes the harm from them, removes the weak hair so that stronger and firmer hair replaces it and it is beneficial for the head. It comforts the newborn and opens the head's skin openings.","Praise be to Allah.Shaving the newborn’s head is Sunnah on the seventh day from his birth. Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""A child is held in pledge for his ‘Aqīqah which should be slaughtered on his behalf on the seventh day after his birth, and he should be given a name, and his head should be shaved."" (Ibn Majah)
Salman ibn ‘Amir narrated that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah upon him) said: ""For a boy, there is an 'Aqiqah. So spill blood for him and remove the harm from him."" (Ahmad) He said that Ibn Sireen used to say if removing harm from him did not mean shaving the head, then I don't know what it is.
Ibn Al-Qayyim (Allah's mercy upon him) said about the benefit of shaving the newborn's hair : 

“Shaving his head removes the harm from him, 
removes the weak hair so that stronger and firmer hair replaces it and it is beneficial for the head. 
In addition, it comforts the newborn and opens the head's skin openings... 
And along with this is a strengthening of his eyesight, his sense of smell and hearing. (Ahkam al-Tifl by Ahmad Al-’Isawi 192)

Sheikh Ibn Uthaimin said: “It appears that shaving the head on that day has a positive effect on the hair roots.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti` 7/540)
And Allah knows best."
170,355,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/355,Children's Character,"Question

Many people are concerned about their childrens unstable characters and the effects of luxury on their personalities. How can we introduce strength and honour into our childrens characters?",,"Praise be to Allah.The issue referred to in the question is one of the most serious problems in raising children nowadays. Some of the Islamic solutions to this problem and ways of instilling strength and honour in our childrens character are listed below:
Takniyyah (using the kunya or patronymic in addressing children)
Calling a young boy ""Abu Foolaan"" (""Father of so-and-so) or a young girl ""Umm Foolaan"" (""Mother of so-and-so"") will make the child feel more responsible and grown up, so he will become more mature and will feel above normal childishness. The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to give kunyas to children. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was the best of people in attitude and manners. I had a brother whom people used to call Abu Umayr. I think he was just past the age of weaning, and whenever he came along the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) would say to him, O Abu Umayr, what did the nughayr do (Ya Abaa Umayr ma faala al-nuhgayr)?"" (The nughayr was a small bird with which he used to play). (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5735).
Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was given some clothes, among which was a small black garment made of silk, known as a khameesah. He said, ""Who do you think I should give this to?"" The people were silent, then he said, ""Bring me Umm Khaalid"" and she was carried to him (which indicates that she was very young). He picked up the garment and put it on her, saying, ""Enjoy it until it wears out."" There was a green or yellow spot on it, and he said, ""O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah"" sanaah means ""beautiful"" in Ethiopian. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5375).
According to another report also narrated by al-Bukhaari: ""He looked at the khameesah and pointed to it, saying, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa."" Sanaa in Ethiopian means beautiful. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5397).
Taking them to gatherings and letting them sit with grown-ups
This will increase their understanding and wisdom, and make them try to imitate adults, as well as keeping them from spending too much time on games and entertainment. The Sahaabah used to bring their children with them when they went and sat with the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him). One of the stories that describe this was narrated by Muaawiyah ibn Qurrah from his father, who said: ""The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to sit with a group of his Companions. One man had his little son with him; he would bring him from behind and make him sit in front of him"" (Reported by al-Nisaai and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkaam al-Janaaiz).
Talking to them about the heroic deeds of earlier and subsequent generations, Islamic battles and Muslim victories
This will encourage them to be brave, which is one of the most important parts of being strong and honourable. Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam had two children, one of whom was present at some of the battles, and the other of whom used to play with the old battle scars on his fathers shoulder. This was reported by Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, who said that the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said to al-Zubayr on the day of Yarmook, ""Will you go and attack, and we will go with you?"" He said, ""If I attacked, you would be lying."" They said, ""No, we will do (as we promised)."" So he launched an attack (against the Romans), penetrating their ranks and passing straight through, but no one was with him. Then he turned around and came back, and the Romans seized the reins of his horse and wounded him twice in the shoulder. Between these two new wounds was a scar from a wound he had received at Badr. Urwah said, ""When I was little, I used to play by putting my fingers in those scars."" Urwah said, "" Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr was with him on that day. He was ten years old. He (al-Zubayr) put him on a horse and entrusted him to the care of another man."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3678).
Commenting on this hadith, Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""Al-Zubayr felt that his son Abdullaah was brave and chivalrous, so he put him on a horse, but he feared that he might attempt to do more than he was able, so he put another man with him so that he could feel that he was safe from the attacks of the Romans should he become distracted by the fighting."" Ibn al-Mubaarak reported from Hishaam ibn Urwah from his father from Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr that he was with his father on the day of Yarmook, and when the mushrikoon (pagans)ran away, he attacked and started killing their wounded, i.e., he finished off every wounded soldier whom he found. This indicates that he was strong and brave from childhood.
Teaching them good manners
Among the manners that should be taught are those described in the hadith (prophetic narration) narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him): ""The young should greet the old, the passerby should greet one who is sitting, and the small group should greet the larger group."" (Al-Bukhaari, 5736).
Giving them the praise and respect they deserve in front of others
This is made clear by the following hadith: Sahl ibn Sad (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was brought a cup and he drank from it. There was a boy, the youngest of all the people, on his right and some elders on his left. He said, ""O young boy, will you allow me to give this to these elders?"" The boy said, ""I will not give away my share of your blessings to anyone, O Messenger of Allah,"" so he gave the cup to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2180)
Teaching them manly sports
- such as archery, swimming and horse riding.
Avoiding humilating them, especially in front of others
Never belittling their ideas, and encouraging them to take part
Consulting them and asking for their opinions
Giving them responsibilities in accordance with their age and abilities
Teaching them to be brave as appropriate including how to speak in public
Making sure their clothes are modest and protecting them from inappropriate clothing, hairstyles, movements and ways of walking
Making sure that boys do not wear silk, as this is only for women
Avoiding extravagance, luxury, laziness and idleness
Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever.""
Avoiding entertainment or pastime gatherings, singing, music and other wastes of time, because these go against strength, honour and seriousness
These are some of the ways and means which will increase strength and honour, and protect our children.

                Is proportional representation in Islam alowable or not.The situation is thus, if there are say 10 Muslim organisations(each with a differant 
number of members) and they all join together to form one mother organisation so that they can co-ordinate between the Islamic work between each other. Is it 
permissible that we catogorise the organisation according to their membership. 
That is if one organisation has 1-100 members they get one vote, 101-200 
members they get two votes and so on, Is this permissible in Islam? I hope you can answer this thank you",,"Praise be to Allah.
There is no problem with this because it is a way of organizing things in order to reach the right 
or better opinion, by using points to represent groups according to their size or number of 
members. But you should know that a ""one man one vote"" system may be unfair if the people 
involved are not equal in trustworthiness, ability, knowledge and experience that are necessary 
for the kind of decision-making that you want to undertake. If they are equal or close enough, 
then ""one man one vote"" is fair and wise. The people of authority (ahl al-hall wa’l-’aqd) in this 
ummah are those who have knowledge and virtue, who are rational and wise, and who are 
prominent and distinguished. These, not the ignorant masses whose opinion is worthless, are 
the ones who select the khaleefah. May Allaah help you to do that which will please Him."

The marriage contract may be made verbally by means of an offer on the part of the bride’s wali or guardian (e.g. “I marry my daughter to you”) and acceptance on the part of the groom (e.g. “I accept”). Writing it down is not a condition, but it does serve to document and confirm the contract, which is a good thing, especially nowadays. And Allaah is the source of help."
173,365,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/365,Is Taking Pictures Haram?,"Question

My question is : IS the taking of PHOTOGRAPHS ALLOWED,(I know drawing pictures of living things is not allowed -but what about taking photograph's of people etc.), can you supply me with some evidence please. I need this information quickly.- Inshallah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Photography (tasweer) means the taking of pictures of living, animate moving beings, like people, animals, birds, etc. The ruling is that it is forbidden on the basis of a number of reports, such as the following:
'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Those who will be most severely punished by Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, see al-Fath, 10/382).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Allah, may He be exalted, says: 'Who does more wrong than the one who tries to create something like My creation? Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of corn.'"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, see Fath al-Baari, 10/385).
 
'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any built-up tomb without levelling it, and do not leave any picture in any house without erasing it."" (Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaa'i; this is the version narrated by al-Nisaa'i).
 
Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and for every image that he made a soul will be created for him, which will be punished in the Fire."" Ibn 'Abbaas said: ""If you must do that, make pictures of trees and other inanimate objects."" (Reported by Muslim, 3/1871)
 
These ahaadeeth indicate that pictures of animate beings are haraam, whether they are humans or other creatures, whether they are three-dimensional or two-dimensional, whether they are printed, drawn, etched, engraved, carved, cast in moulds, etc. These ahaadeeth include all of these types of pictures.
 
The Muslim should submit to the teachings of Islam and not argue with them by saying, ""But I am not worshipping them or prostrating to them!"" If we think about just one aspect of the evil caused by the prevalence of photographs and pictures in our times, we will understand something of the wisdom behind this prohibition: that aspect is the great corruption caused by the provoking of physical desires and subsequent spread of immorality caused by these pictures.
 
The Muslim should not keep any pictures of animate beings in his house, because they will prevent the angels from entering. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, see al-Fath, 10/380).
But nowadays, unfortunately, one can even find in some Muslim homes statues of gods worshipped by the kuffaar (such as Buddha etc.) which they keep on the basis that they are antiques or decorative pieces. These things are more strictly prohibited than others, just as pictures which are hung up are worse than pictures which are not hung up, for how easily they can lead to glorification, and cause grief or be a source of boasting! We cannot say that these pictures are kept for memory's sake, because true memories of a Muslim relative or friend reside in the heart, and we remember them by praying for mercy and forgiveness for them.
Taking pictures with a camera involves human actions such as focusing, pressing the shutter, developing, printing, and so on. We cannot call it anything other than ""picture-making"" or tasweer, which is the expression used by all Arabic-speakers to describe this action.
 
In the book Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam, the author says: ""Photography is even more of an imitation of the creation of Allah than pictures which are engraved or drawn, so it is even more deserving of being prohibited There is nothing that could exclude photography from the general meaning of the reports."" (p. 42, see also Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/355).
 
Among the scholars who have discussed the issue of photography is Shaykh Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, who said: ""Some of them differentiate between hand-drawn pictures and photographic images by claiming that the latter are not products of human effort, and that no more is involved than the mere capturing of the image. This is what they claim. The tremendous energy invested the one who invented this machine that can do in few seconds what otherwise could not be done in hours does not count as human effort, according to these people! Pointing the camera, focusing it, and taking the picture, preceded by installation of the film and followed by developing and whatever else that I may not know about none of this is the result of human effort, according to them!
 
Some of them explain how this photography is done, and summarize that no less than eleven different actions are involved in the making of a picture. In spite of all this, they say that this picture is not the result of human action! Can it be permissible to hang up a picture of a man, for example, if it is produced by photography, but not if it is drawn by hand?
 
Those who say that photography is permitted have ""frozen"" the meaning of the word ""tasweer,"" restriciting it only to the meaning known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and not adding the meaning of photography, which is ""tasweer"" or ""picture-making"" in every sense - linguistic, legal, and in its harmful effects, and as is clear from the definition mentioned above. Years ago, I said to one of them, By the same token, you could allow idols which have not been carved but have been made by pressing a button on some machine that turns out idols by the dozen. What do you say to that?""
(Aadaab al-Zafaaf by al-Albaani, p. 38)
 
It is also worth quoting the opinion of some contemporary scholars who allow the taking of photographs but say that the pictures should not be kept: ""The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures."" (See al-Sharh al-Mumti', 2/198).
 
There are many bad things involved in the making of pictures. Besides the element of imitating the creation of Allah - which is an accusation denied by many of those who make pictures - reality bears witness to the great extent of immorality and provocation of desires caused by the prevalence of pictures and picture-making nowadays. We must remove or blot out every picture, except when it is too difficult to do so, like the pictures which are overwhelmingly prevalent in food packaging, or pictures used in encyclopaedias and reference books. We should remove what we can, and be careful about any provocative pictures that may be found.
 
""So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can"" [al-Taghaabun 64:16 - interpretation of the meaning]
 
Photographs which are essential are permitted - such as those required for identity documents, or for identifying or pursuing criminals [e.g. ""wanted"" posters and the like - translator's note], or for educational purposes which cannot be achieved otherwise. The principle in sharee'ah is that we should not exaggerate about what is necessary.
We ask Allah to accept our repentance and have mercy on us, and to forgive our excesses, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
174,366,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/366,Breaking the Fast or Praying Maghrib?,"Question

Some Muslims have exaggerated about breaking their fast to the point that they miss the Magrib prayer; after eating dates comes the soup and juice and so on.
What is your advice with regard to such behavior?","If the meal is put in front of you without your own intention being to miss the congregational prayer, then you can eat and drink, even if you miss the congregational prayer.","Praise be to Allah.If the meal is put in front of a person without his own intention being to miss the congregational prayer, then he can eat and drink, even if he misses the Maghrib congregational prayer , based on the statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ""If the meal is served and the prayer starts, begin with the meal."" (Al-Bukhari, 631)
As for putting a large portion of food out purposely to miss the congregational prayer, this is the wrong approach and incorrect behavior.
Then what is the sunnah ? The sunnah is what is reported on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ""that he used to break the fast before he prayed with fresh dates, if there were no fresh dates then with dry dates, and if there were no dry dates, then he sipped from water.""

rak’ahs of Tawaaf and before performing al-Saa’iee","Question

                Is it part of the Sunnah to acknowledge the Black Stone after performing 
two rak’ahs of Tawaaf and before performing al-Saa’iee",,"Praise be to Allah.
Passing the Black Stone and acknowledging it, after praying two rak’ahs of Tawaaf 
and drinking from the well of Zamzam and before going out to perform al-Saa’iee is 
proven to be part of the saheeh Sunnah, but it is mustahabb (encouraged), not waajib 
(obligatory), so there is nothing wrong with not doing it.
The proof (daleel) that it is in accordance with the Sharee’ah is the hadeeth of Jaabir 
(may Allaah be pleased with him), reported by Muslim, in which he described the Hajj 
of the Prophet 
:
"". . . Then he went back to the Rukn (the corner of the Ka’bah where the Black Stone 
is situated) and acknowledged it, then he went out through the gate towards 
al-Safaa’.""
Al-Tirmidhi reported from Jaabir that: ""When the Prophet 
 came to Makkah, he 
entered the Mosque and acknowledged the Black Stone, then he passed to the right of 
it and ran for three (circuits of Tawaaf) and walked for four. Then he came to 
al-Maqaam and said: ‘Take Maqaam Ibraaheem as a place of prayer.’ He prayed two 
rak’ahs with the Maqaam between him and the House (Ka’bah).’ Then he came to the 
(Black Stone) after praying two rak’ahs and acknowledged it. Then he went out to 
Safaa’ and I think he said, ‘Safaa’ and Marwa are of the Symbols of Allaah 
[al-Baqarah 2:158].’"" (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 784). 
Al-Tirmidhi said: The hadeeth of Jaabir is a saheeh hasan hadeeth and the scholars 
ruled that we should act in accordance with it).
Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""This is evidence in favour of the 
opinion of al-Shaafi’i and other scholars, that after performing Tawaaf al-Qudoom 
(the Tawaaf of Arrival) and praying behind the Maqaam, a person should go back to 
the Black Stone and acknowledge it, then go out through the Gate of Safaa to perform 
al-Saa’iee. The scholars agree that this acknowledgement is not obligatory, but it is 
Sunnah; the one who does not do it is not obliged to offer a sacrifice in 
compensation. (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 8/428).

      out loud when entering the masjid (while others are praying or during the khutbah) ?
      Please advise the daleel. Jazzakallhu Khayrun",,"Praise be to Allah.The author of Zaad al-Mustanfi said it is
    permissible for the imaam to greet the congregation with salaam when he faces them. Shaykh
    Ibn Uthaymeen said, in his interesting comment, that this is because this practice
    was reported from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Even
    though there is some weakness in this hadeeth (i.e. in its isnaad), this is what the ummah
    has done and it is well known that when the imaam comes and gets up on the minbar, he
    greets the people with salaam. (Reported by al-Shubi). Abu Bakr and Umar used
    to do this. Reported by Abd al-Razzaaq , Ibn Abi Shaybah, 2/114, Ibn Maajah and
    al-Tabaraani. It was also reported by al-Bayhaqi from Jaabir ibn Umar, narrating
    from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he said: a report
    concerning this was narrated from Ibn Abbaas from Umar ibn Abd
    al-Azeez. Then the shaykh said in his commentary: it is not permitted to speak when
    the imaam is delivering the khutbah, it is only permitted before and after the khutbah,
    even after the khateeb has arrived and after the adhaan, so long as the khateeb has not
    started his khutbah. (Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Sharh al-Muttabi li Zaad
    al-Mustanfi, 5/78). [?? Makath ??] is well known, from which we know that it is
    obligatory to return the greeting of salaam, so in this case we understand that it is not
    forbidden to speak. And Allaah knows best. 
    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: When the imaam faces the
    people, he greets them with salaam and they respond, then he sits down. Then he
    mentioned the hadeeth quoted above, and others. Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on
    him): When he greets them with salaam, the people should respond, because it is more
    of an obligation to return the greeting than to initiate it. Then he should sit down and
    rest until the muadhdhinoon (muezzins) finish. (al-Mughni 2/297). And

                Is it mandatory for one who newly embraces Islaam to change his or her name?",,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah.
He or she is not required to change his or her name unless it embodies the worship of someone or 
something other then God, Allaah. However, its amelioration by choosing a new Islamic name is 
legitimate and encouraged. The fact that he or she would change his or her name from a pagan or 
non-Islamic name to an Islamic one would be considered commendable--however, it is not mandatory.
Thus, if one's name is Abdul-Messiah, for example, or similar such names, then he is obligated to 
change it, as the Prophet  (peace upon him) had people with the names Abdul-Ka'bah and 
Abdul-Uzzah change their names upon accepting Islaam. 
If the original name does not comprise or imply anything forbidden in Islaam, then he or she is permitted 
to retain it (such as the name George, for example). As noted, though, it is preferable to change it to an 
Islaamic name, as this also distinguishes him or her from the kuffaar. 
Note that if changing one's name in official documents and records poses a great inconvenience, it 
would suffice to change it among the people. In this case, he or she is called by his or her new name by 
friends, acquaintances, and the general public, while offical documents would retain the original given 
name."
178,373,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/373,"A woman who committed adultery and is contemplating 
suicide","Question

                A married woman commits adultery, then she repented but the guilt of the act is haunting her. She is now
thinking about suicide. What should be done and what is your advice?",,"Praise be to Allah.
Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ""The believer sees his 
sin as a mountain beneath which he is sitting and which he fears may fall 
down upon him. The rebellious person sees his sin as a fly which passes in 
front of his nose and he swats it away"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6308)
This woman's overwhelming sense of the burden of her sin is a sign of 
faith. We offer her the following advice:
She should examine her divorce from her first husband to make sure 
that it is sound according to sharee'ah (Islamic law), whether it took the 
form of talaaq (male-instigated divorce) or khul' (female-instigated 
divorce).
She should make sure that her marriage contract to the second man is 
also sound, because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery is 
not valid unless they have repented (see questions # 33); if the contract 
is found not to be valid, it must be repeated.
If this woman is sincere in her repentance towards Allaah, regrets what 
she did and is determined never to do it again, Allaah will forgive all 
her sins, no matter how great they were, so she should not despair of 
the mercy of Allaah, for no one despairs of Allaah's Mercy, except the 
people who disbelieve, and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord 
except those who are astray?
She should hasten to do many good deeds, to expiate for her sin, as 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And perform al-salaat (the 
prayer) at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. 
Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds"" [Hud 11:114]
She should resume a pure Islamic life, based on purity and chastity. 
Suicide is not a solution at all, as it is one of the most grievous of major 
sins, and will only increase the punishment of the one who does it. The 
Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
""Whoever throws himself down from a high mountain and kills himself 
will be throwing himself down from a mountain in the Fire of Hell for 
all eternity. Whoever takes poison and kills himself will be taking 
poison in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever kills himself with a 
weapon (literally, iron) will be holding it in his hand and stabbing 
himself in the stomach in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. (Reported by 
al-Bukhaari, 5778)
We ask Allaah to help this woman to repent sincerely, to forgive her sins 
and to include her in His Mercy, for He is the All-hearing Who answers 
prayers."
179,377,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/377,Ruling on having a dog,"Question

                ALSALAAM ALAIKUM
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT KEEPING PETS IN THE HOUSE.I KNOW 
THAT THE KALB(DOG)IS CONSIDERED NIJASA, BUT I DON'T KNOW 
WHY.
I REMEMBER A SECTION IN THE Qur'an WHERE THE PROPHET PEACE 
BE UPON HIM ONCE GAVE A THIRSTY DOG WATER TO DRINK OR 
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. 
COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE.
THANK YOU",,"Praise be to Allah.
According to Islaamic Shareeah, it is not permitted to keep a dog except within 
narrowly-defined limits, as the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
explained: ""Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds will decrease every day by one qeeraat (a 
unit of measurement), unless it is a dog for farming or herding."" According to another report: "". 
. . unless it is a dog for herding sheep, farming or hunting."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 2322)
Dogs are extremely naajis (impure, unclean). The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
upon him) said: ""If a dog drinks from the vessel of any one of you, let him wash it seven times"" 
(reported by Muslim, no. 279). According to another report: "". . . and clean it the eighth time with 
earth."" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 280).
It is forbidden in Islaam to sell a dog and to receive payment for it, as is reported in Saheeh 
al-Bukhaari from Abu Masoud al-Ansaari: the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) forbade (accepting) the price of a dog. (al-Fath, no. 2237)
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to resemble dogs by 
placing our forearms on the ground during sujood (prostration), as in reported in the hadeeth 
narrated by Anas ibn Maalik, according to which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah 
be upon him) said: ""Do sujood properly; none of you should spread his forearms like a dog 
does."" (al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 822).
Whoever keeps a dog in his house is denied the blessing of the angels presence in his house, 
as the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The angels 
do not enter a house in which there is a dog."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3225).
Keeping dogs nowadays is the habit of the kuffaar, who adopt them as friends, kiss them, let 
them lick them and their clothes, sleep with them and even leave them money in their wills. 
Keeping a dog is an imitation of the kuffaar. Some Muslims may claim that they need to keep a 
dog at home for purposes of protection, to which we respond that nowadays there are burglar 
alarm systems and other measures one may take for security purposes, and there is no need to 
keep a dog, praise be to Allaah.
It only remains for us to say that the fact that it is forbidden to keep a dog and interect closely 
with it does not mean that we should not be kind or feel compassion towards dogs if we see 
them in a pitiful state. These are two entirely separate matters. The Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that ""a man saw a dog biting the dust because of 
thirst, so he took his shoe and started to scoop water up with it until the dogs thirst was 
quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and granted him entry to Paradise for it."" 
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 174). 
According to another report, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
""Whilst a man was walking he became very thirsty, so he went down to a well and drank from 
it. When he came out, he saw a dog panting and biting the soil because of thirst. The man said, 
He is suffering the same as I suffered, so he filled his shoe (with water), came out and let the 
dog drink until his thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and forgave him 
because of it."" The people asked, ""O Messenger of Allaah, will we be rewarded for how we 
treat animals?"" He said, ""In every living thing there is a reward."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 
2363).
We do not want to omit reminding you of the importance of reading the Quraan properly and 
referring to it. You say in your question that the story of the thirsty dog is in the Quraan, and 
that is not the case, as it is reported in the Sunnah.
And Allaah knows best."
180,378,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/378,Declaring shahaadah and performing salaat for a new non-Arabic speaking Muslim,"Question

I have read the many pages of your web site that instructs a non-believer. I believe that there is only Allah (one God). Ibelieve that Muhammed is the seal of the prophets. History bears this out. My question is: How do I declare this (shahadah) if I do not speak arabic?  How do I perform the five daily prayers (salah) without understanding arabic? Finally would I have to change my name?",,"Praise be to Allah.To the dear inquirer:I welcome you with a warm greeting.  I was besieged with great joy as I discovered your question while browsing through the ten questions which arrived during the past hour today, and it was the dearest question for me.  This fact is not surprising, as how could our hearts not open to a wise man who has discovered the truth and has acknowledged and confirmed it for himself--one who wishes to embrace Islaam and asks about the next steps?
In reality, everything that poses a problem for you is actually an easy matter, and can be solved simply, God willing (in shaa' Allaah), so let's take them one by one:

First:  all that is required of you to embrace this religion right now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce al-shahaadatain, or the two confirmations and attestations of faith, to the best of your ability.  Perfect pronunciation of the Arabic letters is not required, and the following is a transliteration of the phrases with English letters to help you:

ash-hadu an laa ilaahah illallaah (I bear witness and attest that there is no god worthy of worship but the One God Allaah)
ash-hadu anna muhammad-ar-rasool ullaah (I bear  witness and attest that Muhammad is the messenger of Allaah)
After pronouncing them, you should promptly hasten to take a shower to purify yourself and prepare to start performing your regular prayers which will be an obligation as soon as you have declared your belief.

Second:  If you have not yet learned the manner and characteristics of performing the prayer (i.e. at least the movements and positions), appended to this message is a description from which you can learn.  What is requried from you for the time being is to say in the beginning of the prayer and between each movement between positions ""Allaahu ak-bar"" (a glorification of Allaah).  While standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting, you should say ""subhaan allaah wal-hamdu lillaah wa-laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar.""  (Glory be to Allaah, and praise and thanks be to Allaah, and there is no god but Allaah, and Allaah is the most Exalted and Great.)  Then conclude the prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying ""as-salaamu alaikum.""


This way of performing salaat is permissible for you until you can learn and memorize what should be said in each movement and position of the salaat.


Third:  You are not required to change your name, and in fact, a number of scholars among the forefathers and modern-day Muslims have indicated declared that your name is in fact the name of one of the prophets!


I ask Allaah to aid you and ease your affairs, and to bestow upon you the blessing of Islaam and perseverence in adhering to it.  We are ready and willing to assist in explaining or helping to solve any problem or difficulty you may face, and to provide support and aid in any way possible."
181,389,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/389,Wali of Muslimah if her parents are kuffaar,"Question

I come from a muslim family and was brought up with Islamic faith. Although, I have been through a stage in my life which I call the ""dark stage"" of my life, in which I was involved with ""jahiliyah"" practices for some years (yes, those irresponsible and sinful acts). Allah has blessed me with guidance and brought me to His straight path again. Since that time, I have been having a relationship with a christian girlfriend, who has accepted Islam just recently, by Allah's will. We plan to be wedded soon after we are settled. One problem is that she comes from a devout Christian family, not to mention her father being a christian priest. Ever since her family found out about our involvement, they have tried almost everything to part us, we haven't told them about my girlfriend's conversion though. Right now, our relationship has reached a point where she is willing to oppose her family and runaway from them eventually. Even though we know it will be hard to go through, my girlfriend and I really love each other. As I understand, the Islamic law requires that in marriage, a woman should be accompanied by a ""wali"", which to my knowledge, should come from her family. My first question, can our plan to marry without her family's consent be in accordance with Islamic law?
And second, if it can, who can be her ""wali?"", since not one of her family member agree with our relationship.
Thank you, assalaammu'alaikum.",,"Praise be to Allah.First, I offer thanks to Allaah for his grace in having guided you to the path of truth after experiencing a dark journey through 'jahiliyyah', a journey into ignorance and meaninglessness. Allaah guides to his truth whomever he wills. At this point of your life, as an expression of gratitude for Allaah's blessing, you should carry out your duties towards him and desist from the actions that gain his wrath. In fact, Allaah, at this point in your life, must take priority over everything else. You further ought to make up for what you missed in the previous part of your life, to double your efforts in performing worship and to haste in doing good deeds.
Secondly, since this lady in question has converted to Islam, thanks to Allaah, none of her kaafir family members can act as a guardian (wali) of her interests; no kaafir can act in this capacity over a Muslim. If there is a Muslim with some authority in your area over the affairs of the Muslim community, then he can act in this capacity, based on the Prophet's (peace be upon him) hadeeth:
""No marriage contract can be concluded without the presence of a Wali. A Sultan (authority figure) can act as a Wali for those without one."" (see Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad, Hadith number 1880; also in Salih al-Jaami', hadeeth number 7556.)
If there is no authoritative Muslim person, then one should refer to the community Muslim leader or any Muslim who is just ('aadil), respected, and of high character, such as the director of the Islamic center or its imam, to conclude the marriage contract of this sister, with her consent."

for oneself or member of family?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah.
It is not desirable for a person to dig his grave ahead
of time as this was not done by Prophet 
 (peace
be upon him) nor by his companions. A person does not know where he will
die. If the intention of the person is to get ready for death, then preparation
should be in good deeds. (See selections of Jurisprudence
writings by Ibn Taymiyah, Funeral Rights, by al-Albani, p.160, 40th ed,
Islamic Center).In otherwords, preperation for
meeting Allaah, is not by digging graves. Instead, it is accomplished by
overabundance of good deeds. If it is not possible in predominantly non-Muslim
countries to have a cemetery or dedicated plot for the burial of Muslims
unless the graves are reserved beforehand (e.g., to raise the funds), then
there would be no objection in this case."

Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs.

185,427,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427,Circumcision for women is not obligatory,"Question

                I would like to know more about female circumcision in Islam. I have read the 
ahadith where the Prophet told a woman how to perform it. I would like to know if 
it is optional or obligatory, and - if it is obligatory - whether there is a certain way 
to do it (what part should be cut?).",,"Praise be to Allah.
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his book al-Mughni: ""Circumcision is obligatory for men, and it is an honour for women, but it is not obligatory for them. This is the opinion of many scholars. (Imam) Ahmad said: For men it is more strictly required, but for women it is less strictly required."" (al-Mughni 1/70).
Circumcision of the female consists of the removal of a part of the clitoris, which is situated 
above the opening of the urethra. The Sunnah is not to remove all of it, but only a part. 
(al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah 19/28).
In this matter, it is wise to follow the interests of the female: if the clitoris is large, then part of it 
should be removed, otherwise it should be left alone. This size of the clitoris will vary from 
woman to woman, and there may be differences between those from hot climates and those 
from cold climates.
A hadith on the topic of female circumcision has been attributed to the Prophet 
 (Peace 
and Blessings of Allah be upon Him), according to 
which he said: ""Circumcision is a Sunnah for men, and an honour for women,"" but there is 
some debate as to the authenticity of this hadith. See Silsilah al-Ahadith al-Da‘ifah by al-Albani, no. 
1935.
How circumcision is to be performed is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Umm ‘Atiyah, may 
Allah be pleased with her, according to which a woman used to perform circumcisions in 
Madinah. The Prophet 
 (Peace 
and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) told her: ""Do not abuse (i.e. do not go to extremes in circumcising); 
that is better for the woman and more liked by her husband."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, 
Kitab al-Adab; he said this hadith is da‘if).
The scholars’ opinions cited above should be sufficient explanation. And Allah knows best."

assets they have will be divided between myself, my brother and my sister (who 
are also not Muslims).
What is the Islamic ruling on inheritance for Muslims whose parents are 
non-Muslim?",,"Praise be to Allah.
A Muslim is not permitted to inherit anything of the wealth of a non-Muslim relative, as the 
Prophet 
 (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The believer does not inherit from a kaafir (disbeliever) and the kaafir does not 
inherit from a believer."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath 4283). According to another report, he said: 
""The Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim."" 
(al-Bukhaari, 6764). The Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: ""People who belong to two different 
religions do not inherit from one another."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Faraa’id, and 
deemed hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 7614) - because when the ties of religion are cut, the ties 
of inheritance are also cut, because the former is the basis of the latter.
However, if a non-believer makes a will leaving one-third or less of his wealth to his child (son 
or daughter), one is entitled to take it, because this is a will as opposed to inheritance according 
to a non-Islamic system. This difference is well-known in Islamic fiqh.

                In some bookshops there are
      advertisements for a scheme whereby the customer pays a set amount of money each month and
      gets two things: he will be supplied with new books in a specific area of interest, such
      as fiqh, etc, and he will get a 10% discount if he wants to buy books from these stores.
      What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of gambling, concerning which Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic
    drinks), gambling, al-ansaab (stone altars for making sacrifices to idols, etc.) and
    al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s
    handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:90]
Gambling means everything that involves one side trying to take
    advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the other will be the loser.
    This is the shar’i ruling on gambling. So a man who pays 500 riyals every month, for
    example, may buy books for which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or
    he may not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which the discount
    adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will be the winner, and the storekeeper
    will be the loser; if he does not buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner
    and the man will be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in
    return. This transaction is a kind of gambling and is not permissible."
188,434,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/434,The Muslim belief concerning the destiny of non-Muslim monotheists in the Hereafter,"Question

                What do Muslims believe happens in the hereafter to Non-Muslims that believe in one God?",,"Praise be to Allah.
Your interest in studying Islam is something great, which we appreciate. Everyone should seek 
the truth wherever it may be, and follow it even if it differs from the way of their forefathers or 
the religion of the country or society in which they live, because salvation from the Fire of Hell 
on the Day of Judgement is more important than anything else.
One of the most important things that the would-be student of Islam should do is to consult 
authentic Islamic references, in order to understand the reality of this religion. For example, one 
should consult translations of the meanings of the Qur’an and the ahaadeeth (sayings) of the 
Prophet of Islam, Muhammad 
 (peace be upon him), ensuring that the translations are 
sound. But reading books written by non-Muslims, or by Muslims who do not really 
understand or practice their religion, is not a scholarly approach or a sound method of finding 
out the truth.
Returning to your question, what do Muslims believe will happen to atheists? Or for that 
matter, what about monotheists who are not Muslim? Will their fate be Hell in the Hereafter? 
The answer is that Allaah has clearly created everything, sent His blessings on His creation, and 
sent Messengers and Revealed Books to tell them that whoever believes in and worships Him 
alone, not associating any partner with Him, will enter Paradise, and whoever denies Him, or 
worships something else besides Him, or takes other gods instead of Him, or says that He has 
a wife or son, or that the angels are His daughters, or follows a law other than that which He 
revealed to judge between people in truth, or turns away from His religion, will be doomed in 
the Hereafter to the eternal punishment of Hell. This is exact justice, and this will be the fate 
deserved by the one who did not give his Creator His due.
Worshipping Allaah, obeying His commands and adhering to His prohibitions are basic 
matters, but they form the essence of the relationship between the Creator and His creation. 
Allah says:
""And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and men except they should worship Me (alone)."" 
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Messengers were sent with one message: to tell their people ""Worship Allaah, for you have no 
god besides Him.""
Hence we may understand just how far short the person falls who believes that Allaah is one 
and does not associate anything with Him, but does not worship or obey Him, but rebels 
against Him and fails to follow His religion or Law, or the Revelation and Messengers which He 
sent for him and people like him. Does such a person deserve to enter Paradise or Hell?
This is the person who says: ""I believe that there is One God Who created the universe, but I 
am going to stop there; I will not pray to Him or fast or perform Hajj or pay zakaat as He 
commanded. I am not going to carry out any duties towards Him; I will follow my own desires 
and do whatever I want, whether He permitted it or forbade it."" Can such a person attain 
salvation on the Day of Judgement?
Allaah sent Messengers to every nation, that they might worship Him and shun false deities. 
The last nation is this ummah, and the last Messenger is Muhammad 
 (peace be upon 
him). Allaah sent him for the whole of mankind, the entire world, and thus abrogated the 
previous laws and made this religion the best and most perfect and complete. Hence it is 
obligatory for everyone to enter this religion, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the 
Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
On this basis, the fate of one who says ""I believe in the idea of One God, but I do not want to 
be a Muslim, or I do not want to follow the last Revelation or the last Prophet,"" is clear.
Furthermore, the fate of an atheist, who rejects even the belief in God, is even clearer and more 
evident.
Finally, I hope that the matter is now clearer to you. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and 
help us to follow it, for He is the best Supporter and Helper."

The evidence that Allah is the only Creator of life may be found in many places in the Qur’an and

""Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things,

""Is, then, He Who creates as one who creates not?""[al-Nahl 16:17]
""Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created . . .""[al-Furqaan 25:3]
Allah challenged all of mankind to create even the most insignificant creature, i.e. a fly, but no one 
could do that and no one ever will. Allah says:
""O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): verily! Those on whom you call 
besides Allah cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if 
the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So 
weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.""[al-Hajj 22:73]
Imam al-Bukhari reported in his Saheeh from Abu Sa‘eed (may Allah be pleased with him) that the 
Prophet

A young man is an imam in one of the mosques. He is, as he says, well-liked by the people at the mosque, but he knows deep down that he has shortcomings and is guilty of some sins, and does not deserve to be the imam or to have this love and respect from people. He fears that if he remains as imam of the mosque, he may become a hypocrite or show off. Should he stay in the mosque? Should he continue leading the people in prayer, or should he leave this position out of fear of becoming a hypocrite and show off?",,"Praise be to Allah.You describe this young man as being loved by his people, but he is guilty of some transgression which is a matter between him and his Lord. I say that the fact that Allah has blessed him with the position of imam and the love of his people dictates that he should give up his sin and stop transgressing against himself, and he should worship Allah properly, and give thanks to Allah, because the fact that a person is loved by his people and is their imam is a great blessing from Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the slaves of the Most Beneficient (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness…
And those who say: ‘Our Lord… and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious)…” [al-Furqaan 25:63-74]
Those who pray are among the pious, and the one who leads them in prayer is included in this aayah, “…and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious)…” So let him praise Allah for this blessing, and stop transgressing against himself, and let him make this one of the means of bringing himself back to obedience to Allah, and let him fear Allah with regard to his status.
When he says that he is afraid he may show off, this is waswaas (insinuating thoughts) that the Shaytaan puts into a person’s mind whenever he wants to do an act of obedience to Allah. The Shaytaan comes to him and says, “You are showing off.” He has to cast this idea aside, ignore it and seek the help of Allah, for he always recites in his salaah the words, “Iyyaaka na’budu wa iyyaaka nasta’een (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help” [al-Fatihah 1:5 – interpretation of the meaning]."

My wife and i have discused me having a second wife and she sayes that if i do then she would devorse me.we did not get married by the kafirs but we do have a islamic contract. and there was no agreement on that contract forbiding me from taking a second wife.so my question is .Is it permisable for her to deny me this?And is'nt she making the hallal harram on me. my wife is a good muslimah (I.S.A.) and she would respect a answer whith proof. jazallahkum ma lakair",,"Praise be to Allah.If a man is able to marry a second wife, physically and financially, and he can treat both wives in a just manner, and he wants to take a second wife, then he is allowed to do so according to Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:3]
And this was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), but apart from the Prophet, no one is permitted to have more than four wives.
It is well known that women are by nature jealous and reluctant to share their husband with other women. Women are not to be condemned for this jealousy, for it existed in thebest of righteous women, the Sahaabiyyaat, and even in the Mothers of the Believers [the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)]. But women should not let jealousy make them object to that which Allah has prescribed, and they should not try to prevent it; a wife should allow her husband to marry another woman for this is a kind of cooperating in righteousness and piety. According to a hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever pays attention to his brother’s needs, Allah will pay attention to his needs.”
The first wife’s consent is not a prerequisite for a man to take another wife. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about this and replied as follows:
“It is not obligatory for the husband, if he wants to take a second wife, to have the consent of his first wife, but it is good manners and kindness to deal with her in such a manner that will reduce the hurt which women naturally feel in such situations. This is done by being kind to her and speaking to her in a gentle and pleasant manner, and by spending whatever money may be necessary in order to gain her acceptance of the situation.”
Concerning her request for divorce if her husband wants to marry another wife, this is a mistake. But they should examine the situation, and if she really cannot cope with living with another wife, then she can ask him for khula’ [ a kind of divorce instigated by the wife, whereby she forgoes the mahr]. If she can cope with living with the second wife, but it hurts her to do so, then she should be patient and seek the pleasure of Allah. Thawbaan (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“No woman asks her husband for a divorce for no reason, but the fragrance of Paradise is forbidden for her.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him).
If she bears it with patience, then Allah will make it easier for her and will expand her chest (i.e., grant her peace and calm), and will compensate her with something good. The husband must also help her by treating her kindly, being patient with her for any jealousy etc. on her part, and overlooking her mistakes. And Allah is the source of help."

(1) ""Muslims are to honor their agreements (with others)"";
(2) ""A Muslim's wealth is forbidden for others to use without his permission;"" and,
(3) ""Whoever is the first to acquire a mubaah (something lawful to acquire) is entitled to keep it"".

Also, Sheikh Muhammad bin Salih Al-'Uthaimeen has ruled that whatever is customary among people should be the rule except when a user wants a copy for himself and the author or the copyright holder did not explicitly prohibit copying the software for private or public use. However, if the author or the copyright holder specifically stated that private and public copying of the software is prohibited, then it is not permissible to copy that software."
194,463,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/463,Circumcision for men,"Question

                Is circumcision mandatory for the man who adopts Islam?  What is the Islamic rule on 
female circumcision?",,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. 
    To the dear inquirer: 
We appreciate the question you have submitted, 
  as it is an issue which is truly among those which may pose a hindrance in some 
  cases for those who wish to adopt Islaam. 
In reality the issue is really simpler 
  than many may think.  Male circumcision is among the rites of Islaam and 
  is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character 
  and instinct of the human creation, and is from the religion of Ibrahim (peace 
  be upon him).  Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then 
  we revealed to you (the command) to follow the pure and uncorrupted religion 
  of Ibrahim."" 
The Prophet  
  (peace be upon him) said: 
""The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be 
  upon him) was circumcisized when he was eighty years old."" (Al-Bukhari, 
  Vol 6/p. 388, Al-Salfiyya printing). 
Male circumcision is obligatory for the 
  Muslim male if he is able to do it.  If, however, he is unable, whether 
  due to fear of injury or if a respected and authoritative doctor has told him 
  he will experience profuse bleeding which may make his life miserable, then 
  the obligation for cirumcision is waived and he does not commit a sin by not 
  having it done. 
It is not permissible under any circumstance 
  for the issue to become a hindrance for a person wanting to accept Islaam.  
  The validity of one's acceptance of Islaam is not dependent on his performance 
  of circumcision and it is valid for one to adopt Islaam even if he has not had 
  himself circumcized. 
Regarding the issue of female circumcision, 
  please refer to question # 328. 
I ask Allaah to bring you success in all 
  that is good and to protect you from all that is evil, and may the peace and 
  blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad

They will never even smell the fragrance of Paradise."" (Narrated by Ahmad; see also Sahih Al-Jami`, 8153)

It was also reported from the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) that one should change grey hair, using any colour except black .

(Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1675; he said: This is an authentic Hadith).

Dyeing hair with pure black dye is prohibited because the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""Avoid black,"" and because of the threat of punishment reported with regard to this matter. This ruling applies to both men and women .

But if the black dye is mixed with another colour, so that it is no longer black, there is nothing wrong with it. (See, Fatwa Islamiyyah, 4/424, Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 2/520)

                Is zakat due on Mutual Funds investments that are in a RRSP (Registered Retirement 
Savings Plan) account? If yes, then is it due on the total value or only on that portion 
which will be available after Income Tax has been deducted at source?
(RRSP is the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. 401K Plan. Under this scheme, one can 
save money towards future retirement income and defer current Income Tax on the 
portion of the income that is being saved in the plan. The deferred income tax is later 
deducted at source when the funds are eventually withdrawn from the plan; however, 
since the withdrawals are usually done after retirement (when there is no other 
significant source of income), one ends up being taxed at a substantially lower tax rate. 
Naturally, withdrawal prior to retirement will incur higher tax rates.)",,"Praise be to Allah.
If a person receives an amount of money that he could not have received before, like a bonus or 
lump sum paid at the end of a period of work, or on retirement, no zakat is due for the time that has 
passed. Zakat must be paid on whatever is left of that money after an entire Hijri year has passed.
If tax or anything else is deducted, then zakat is due only on the amount which the person receives,

Any information you could give me would be greatly appreciated.",The basic reason why tawaf is done counterclockwise is to follow the suit of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has been ordained in the Quran and the Sunnah.,"Praise be to Allah.The basic reason for keeping the Ka`bah on one’s left when performing tawaf (circumambulation) is to follow the suit of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Following the Prophet has been ordained in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
""Obey the Prophet so that you may be blessed with mercy"" and ""Say (O Muhammad): if you really love Allah, then follow my suit and Allah will love you and grant you forgiveness of your sins"".
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), furthermore, has said regarding the rituals of Hajj and `Umrah, ""Follow my suit in performing your rituals"". (See An-Nasai as reported by Jabir. Also, Sahih al-Jami`, hadith No. 7882)
This should suffice as the reason for a Muslim to perform tawaf around the Ka`bah in the way it is done, and we do not need other reasons that attempt to tie this act to the movement of galaxies and stars or the revolving of planets, etc. 
Muslims by nature must believe, submit to and act according to what was validly and duly recorded as the behavior or statements of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
If on top of this a reason or some relevant wisdom comes to be known, then so be it, thanks to Allah. Otherwise, a Muslim submits to the order of Allah and His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and will accordingly be recompensed for his compliance and deeds.
Finally, we must note that circumambulation is an act specified only for the Ka`bah as part of the worship and is not to be done in other places or situations as such.

However, to read a specific verse a certain number of times (whether 99 times or whatever else) without

Allaah. Is it possible for us to discover new things in our religion that the Prophet  didnt know?

Muslims respect and revere Jesus (peace be upon him), and await his second coming. They consider him one of the greatest of God’s messengers to mankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as `Jesus', but always adds the phrase ""peace be upon him."" 
Creation of Jesus
The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled `Mary') in her time, and Mary is considered the purest woman in all creation. 
The Quran describes the creation of Jesus as follows (interpretation of the meaning): 
""Behold! the Angel said, `God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and the Hereafter, and one that shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' She said: `O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: `Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He but says to it, ""Be!"" and it is."" (Al Imran 3:42-7) 
Jesus (peace be upon him) was born miraculously through the same power which had brought Adam (peace be upon him) into being without a father: ""Truly, the likeness of Jesus unto Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, `Be!' and he was."" (Al Imran 3:59) 
Miracles of Jesus 
During his prophetic mission, Jesus (peace be upon him) was granted and performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said (interpretation of meaning): 
""I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the lepers, and I raise the dead by Allah’s leave."" (Al Imran 3:49) 
Other miracles include speaking soon after birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, and, most importantly, the message he was carrying. 
Was Jesus crucified?
These miracles were granted to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified , but it only appeared so; instead, Allah raised him unto Heaven. (An-Nisa 4:157) 
Neither Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), nor Jesus (peace be upon him), came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God , brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. 
In the Quran Jesus (peace be upon him), is reported as saying that he came: ""To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me."" (al Imran 3:50)

It is prohibited to take any measure which would
        permanently prevent pregnancy, or cause infertility. It is permissible, however, to use
        temporary birth control methods to delay pregnancy, as in the case of delaying pregnancy
        for the two years of breast feeding the first child.

It is prohibited to use any birth control method which
        would harm the body, as the Prophet  said: ""Do not (impose)
        harm, nor (inflect) harm"". He also said: ""And your body has a right
        upon you""."

    The practice may also contain some element of imitating the kuffaar, especially if it is
    proven that the crescent is a symbol used by those who worship heavenly bodies. So we
    should not use this symbol, and the mosques money should not be spent on something

percentage of the bill and if you further delay by another month an extra 
amount is added to the previous total using the same percentage on the whole

Yes, this extra amount is undoubtedly considered ribaa, as the longer period for 
payment they allow you the more they increase the amount for you to pay. You need to 
refuse this kind of transaction. If you are forced, then pay the original sum without the 
extra amount. If you are forced to pay the extra amount, then pay it while offering 
repentance to Allaah and committing not to deal in such transactions again."
214,591,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/591,Abnormal relationship between women,"Question

I am a believer and I am in love with a believer. We are both women and have already had children who we are taking good care of, but their fathers have deserted us . We both want to live as good muslims, but we love each other so much . We have been told culturally that our love is an abomination, however we cannot find anything in the Quran which condemns us or our actions. We are hurting no one. We are employed. We are educating our children and nurturing our families. We know the passage in the Quran about Soddem and Gommorah, but that appears to deal with the rape of men by men. It does not speak to monogamous love between two women. We love Allah and want to do his will. We need more information about our situation.",,"Praise be to Allah.Just as illicit sexual relations can occur between men, they can also occur between women. The Muslim fuqahaa call this sihaaq (lesbianism), which they define as sexual relations between one woman and another (al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah by Zaydaan, 5/450), and state that it is a punishable offence (the punishment is a form of discipline for disobedience; no specific punishment is given in the Quran, so the punishment is to be set by the Qaadi according to the circumstances of the crime and the one who commits it). The lesbians testimony is unacceptable because she is a evildoer (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/253). Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: ""If two women masturbate one another, then they are cursed fornicators"" (al-Mughni 10/162). Some of the scholars, like al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam say that a lesbian is not permitted to look at a Muslim woman, and that a Muslim woman is not permitted to uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of a lesbian, because she is an evildoer who cannot be trusted not to describe her to others.
If what is described above is the nature of the relationship between the two women mentioned in the question, then they must repent sincerely to Allah and stop their evil actions. If their being together in one place will lead to them committing this sin, then they must never meet, so as to avoid this wrongful act. Their husbands desertion of them may be one of the reasons for them falling into this kind of perversion, because they have no legitimate way in which to fulfil their desires and so they have resorted to this haraam way. So they must think seriously of finding Muslim husbands with whom they can live in the way prescribed by Islam.
 
As for love, this is a different kind of sin, which need not necessarily be associated with physical desire. It is dangerous because it leads to the lover worshipping the beloved, so that he thinks only of the one he loves, cannot bear to be parted from him by day and dreams about him at night; he lives and dies for his sake, and may change when he sees him and become sick when he is absent. This kind of relationship destroys a persons mental health and destroys his relationship with his Lord, because it makes the lover worship his beloved and it is haraam to worship anything other than Allah.
The solution to this disastrous situation is total separation, so that one will never see that person, or hear news of him again."

218,604,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/604,Justification for following the Sunnah,"Question

 
Why do we have to follow the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad and not just follow the quran ?
Why do we have to follow a specific Mathab?",,"Praise be to Allah.The first question may appear strange and somewhat surprising to committed, practising Muslims. How can something which is so obviously one of the bases of Islaam become a matter for discussion and debate? But since the question has been asked, we will present, with the help of Allah, the principles and bases of the importance of the Sunnah, the obligation to follow it and the ruling concerning those who reject it. By so doing, we will also refute the doubters and the misguided group who call themselves “Quraniyyeen” (the Quran has nothing to do with them!) In sha Allah this discussion will be of benefit to everyone who wants to understand the truth of the matter.
Proof of the importance of the Sunnah
(1) The Quran speaks of the importance of the Sunnah, for example:
(a) Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:80] Allah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]
(b) Allah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “. . . And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [al-Nur 24:63]
(c) Allah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: “”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:65]
(d) Allah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: “O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life . . .” [al-Anfaal 8:24]
(e) Allah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: “. . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]
(2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example:
(a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi’ and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying ‘I don’t accept it; we didn’t find any such thing in the Book of Allah.’” Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663).
Al-’Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Would any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allah would only describe what is forbidden in the Quran? I tell you, by Allah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Quran, if not more so.” (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wa’l-imaarah wa’l-fay’).
(b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-’Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allah be pleased with him, that “the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said), ‘Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it.’” (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah).
(3) The scholars’ consensus (ijmaa’) affirming the importance of the Sunnah.
Al-Shaafi’i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “I do not know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een who narrated a report from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabi’een, and those whom we met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be considered as one of the ignorant.
(4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah.
The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition to what is in the Quran. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and the Quran when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions.
The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of the religion.
As regards your second question, about whether a Muslim is required to follow a particular madhhab, the answer is that he does not have to. For the average “rank and file” Muslim, his madhhab is that of his mufti or the scholar whom he consults for religious verdicts; he must ask those pious scholars whom he trusts for opinions when necessary. If a person has enough knowledge to distinguish which evidence and opinion is stronger, then he must follow the scholarly opinion which has the strongest support from the Quran and Sunnah. It is acceptable for a Muslim to follow one of the four well-known madhhabs, on the condition that he understands that the truth in any given issue may lie with another madhhab, in which case he must ignore his own madhhab’s opinion and follow the truth. The Muslim’s aim is to follow the truth that is in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. The madhhabs of fiqh are only a means of reaching ahkaam (rules) based on the Quran and Sunnah, they are not Quran and Sunnah.
We ask Allah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood and help us to avoid it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

220,606,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/606,Why Does Allah Refer to Himself as ‘We’?,"Question

Why does the Quran use the term ""We"" when referring to Allah in its verses? Many non-believers believe that this may be in reference to Jesus?","1- It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu, ‘We’, for respect or glorification. 
2- He may also use the word ana, ‘I’, indicating one person, or the third person huwa, ‘He’. All three styles are used in the Quran, where Allah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue.","Praise be to Allah.It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu, ‘We’, for respect or glorification. He may also use the word ana, ‘I’, indicating one person, or the third person huwa, ‘He’ . All three styles are used in the Quran , where Allah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 4/143)
“Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sometimes refers to Himself in the singular, by name or by use of a pronoun, and sometimes by use of the plural, as in the phrase (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily, We have given you a manifest victory” [Al-Fath 48:1], and other similar phrases. But Allah never refers to Himself by use of the dual, because the plural refers to the respect that He deserves, and may refer to His names and attributes, whereas the dual refers to a specific number (and nothing else), and He is far above that.” (Al-‘Aqidah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 75)
These words, inna (“Verily We”) and nahnu (“We”), and other forms of the plural, may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which they say “We have decided…” etc. [This is known in English as “The Royal We” – Translator].
In such cases, only one person is speaking but the plural is used for respect. The One Who is more deserving of respect than any other is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so when He says in the Quran inna (“Verily We”) and nahnu (“We”), it is for respect and glorification, not to indicate plurality of numbers. If a verse of this type is causing confusion, it is essential to refer to the clear, unambiguous verses for clarification. 
If a Christian, for example, insists on taking verses such as “Verily, We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran)” [al-Hijr 15:9 – interpretation of the meaning] as proof of divine plurality, we may refute this claim by quoting such clear and unambiguous verses as (interpretation of the meanings): “And your god is One God, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:163] and “Say: He is Allah, the One” [al-Ikhlas 112:1] – and other verses which can only be interpreted in one way. 
Thus confusion will be dispelled for the one who is seeking the truth. Every time Allah uses the plural to refer to Himself, it is based on the respect and honour that He deserves, and on the great number of His names and attributes, and on the great number of His troops and angels.” (See Al-‘Aqidah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 109)

I am a firm believer in the Quran and Allah. Thank Allah my faith and trust in Him grows each day. My concern is this: the Quran mentions over and over the blessings of Heaven. It repeatedly mentions beautiful, pure maidens as a bounty of Heaven. People often say Islam is a male dominance religion.
Why is there no mention of rewards for women?","Allah promised those who do good deeds, be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and they will be rewarded in the Hereafter.","Praise be to Allah.All address to men in the Quran is address to women
Since you believe in Allah and His Book, you must know that {and not one will thy Lord treat with injustice}, Verse 49, Surat al-Kahf, or the Cave, and {Allah is never unjust in the least degree: if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from His Own Self a great reward}, Verse 40, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women. (Translation of the meanings)
Allah has meant this Law of Islam (Shari'ah) for both men and women. All address to men in the Quran is address to women as well, and all rules affecting men affect women as well unless evidence is established that one of them is meant and not the other as in the rules relating to Jihad (fighting for Islam), menstruation, custodianship, rule etc.
The evidence that women are included in Verses of the Quran in the male gender is a Hadith by ‘Aishah who said that the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about a man who sees traces of semen but does not remember having any dream of a sexual nature. The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Such a man should perform the Ghusl (ritual bath).”
He was also asked of a man who remembers a dream of a sexual nature but sees no traces of semen. He said: ""Such a man does not have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath). Umm Salim said ""A woman may have the same experience. Does she have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath)?"" The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Yes, there is no difference in this between man and woman."" (Narrated by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi 113 and others. The last phrase is in Sahih al-Jami’ under No. 2333)
What will women get in Jannah?
With respect to rewards in the Hereafter and what women have in Heaven , we include a number of Verses and Hadiths as follows:
Umm Salamah said: ""O Messenger of Allah. I did not hear a Verse in the Quran regarding the Hijrah (migration with the Prophet) of women."" Then was revealed the Verse: {And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: ye are members, one of another: those who have left their homes, and were driven out therefrom, and suffered harm in My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I will blot out from them their inequities, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath; ... A reward from Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards.}, Verse 195, Surat al-Imran, or the Family (translation of the meaning). The Hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3023.
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse {fastajaba lahum rabbuhum} means Allah replied to their queries ... and the Verse {anni la udi’u ‘amala ‘amilin minkum min thakarin aw untha} is an explanation of the reply meaning that good deeds will not be lost or ignored. All men and women will have the just reward for their deeds. The Verse {ba’dukum min ba’d} means you will be treated equally with respect to rewards .
{If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.}, Verse 124, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women (translation of the meaning).
In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse shows Allah’s kindness, generosity and mercy in accepting the good deeds of all people, men and women, provided that they believe, in allowing them into Heaven and in not decreasing rewards for their good deeds, not even in the least.
{Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has faith, verily, to him will we give a life that is good and pure, and we will bestow on such their reward according to the best of actions.}, Verse 97, Surat an-Nahl, or the Bees (translation of the meaning).
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said this is a promise by Allah, the Exalted, to those who do good deeds i.e. deeds acceptable to Allah in which a Muslim follows the rules set in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him), be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and will be rewarded in the Hereafter. A good life would include all types of comfort.
{He that makes evil will not be requited but by the like thereof; and he that makes a righteous deed whether man or woman and is a believer, such will enter the garden (of bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure.}, Verse 40, Surat al-Muminun, or the believers (translation of the meaning).
Finally; Dear Sister, here is a Hadith that will dispel any doubt you may have with respect to the mentioning of women:
Umm Umarah al-Ansariyyah said that she went to the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) and said to Him: ""I feel that everything is for men. Women are not mentioned as having anything. Then was revealed the Verse (translation of the meaning): {For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women etc}, Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates. The Hadith is narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3211, and is in Sahih at-Tirmidhi under No. 2565.
In the collection of Hadiths of Imam Ahmad was narrated the Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: ""I said ""O Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) of Allah. Why aren’t we mentioned in the Quran in an equal footing with men?"" Then; I was surprised to hear Him call one day from the pulpit: ""O people."" As I was combing my hair at the moment, I wrapped it up and came close to the door and stood there listening to him say: ""Allah, Mighty and Sublime be He, revealed that (in meaning) {For Muslim men and women; for believing men and women; for devout men and women, for true men and women; for men and women who are patient and constant; for men and women who humble themselves; for men and women who give in charity; for men and women who fast; for men and women who guard their chastity; and for men and women who engage much in Allah's remembrance, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.} Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates.
We ask Allah to give us all the ability to show sincerity in words and deeds and to continue as well-established Muslims.

      did'nt prayed. please advice me what I have to do for this?",,"Praise be to Allah.Remember how Allaah has blessed you by bringing 
  you back to Islam after you have been neglecting salaah, and keep on doing the 
  prayers at the right times. Do more naafil (supererogatory or extra) prayers 
  to make up for the fard (obligatory) prayers that you have missed, as was advised 
  in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Hurayth ibn Qubaysah, who said: I came 
  to Madeenah and prayed, O Allaah, send me a righteous companion. 
  I went and sat with Abu Hurayrah and said: I asked Allaah to bless me 
  with a righteous companion; tell me a hadeeth that you heard from the Messenger 
  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him), so that I may benefit therefrom. He said: I heard the Messenger 
  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) say that the first thing for which a person will be brought to account 
  on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound, he will be successful, 
  and if it is lacking in any way, he will be doomed. If his obligatory prayers 
  are lacking, the Lord will say: Look and see whether My slave has any 
  voluntary prayers which may be used to make up what is lacking in his obligatory 
  prayers. Then all his deeds will be examined and dealt with in the same 
  way. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 413; see 
  also Saheeh al-Jaami, 2020). 
  Abu Dawood reported from Anas ibn Hakeem al-Dabbi that he came to Madeenah and 
  met Abu Hurayrah. He said: He asked me about my lineage so I told him 
  about it, then he said: O young man, shall I not tell you a hadeeth? 
  I said, Of course, may Allaah have mercy on you, and I think he 
  mentioned it from the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him). He said: The first thing that people will be asked 
  about on the Day of Resurrection will be their prayers. Our Lord will say to 
  His angels (although He knows best): Look at My slaves prayers: 
  are they complete or is something lacking? If they are complete, they 
  will be recorded as such, but if something is lacking, He will say: Look 
  and see if My slave has any voluntary prayers to his credit. If this proves 
  to be the case, He will say: Make up his (missing) obligatory prayers 
  with his voluntary prayers. Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with 
  in the same manner. (Saheeh al-Jaami, 2571)"

                what is Id al-Adha, The festival 
of sacrafice. my daughter is doing a homework assignment 
I need as much info or where else to look as soon as possible?",,"Praise be to Allah.Eid al-Adhaa is the tenth day of Dhoo’l-Hijjah, the last
    (twelfth) month of the Hijri or Islamic calendar. It is, as the Prophet 
 (peace be
    upon him) said: “The greatest day in the sight of Allaah, may He be blessed and
    exalted, the Day of Sacrifice . . .” (Reported by Abu Dawud; see also Saheeh
    al-Jaami‘, 1064).
It is also the greatest day of Hajj, as the Prophet 
 (peace be
    upon him) told us. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, see Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 8191).
The reason why it is described as the greatest day of the year is
    that it combines so many acts of worship which are not combined on any other day, such as
    the Eid prayer, offering the sacrifice, reciting Takbeer (glorifying Allaah), and
    widespread remembrance of Allaah. For the pilgrims in Makkah, it also includes offering a
    sacrifice, stoning the pillars representing Shaytaan (the devil), shaving the head (for
    men only; women merely cut a little off their hair), and performing Tawaaf

    If you are praying Fajr prayer before the sun rises, then the 
    Sunnah in your case is to pray the regular Sunnah of Fajr which is two 
    rak’ahs. If you miss Fajr and do not wake up until after the sun has risen, 
    then you should pray Sunnah and then Fard (obligatory prayer). But if you 
    always delay Fajr prayer until after the sun has risen, this is a serious 
    problem. In this case, before you ask about the Sunnah prayer you have to 
    pause and ask yourself what you will say when you stand before Allaah on the

What is the ruling on a person changing his lineage in order to obtain nationality of a country for certain benefits? For example, a man might claim to be the child or brother of an uncle or other relative who holds the desired nationality, so as to obtain that nationality and all the benefits etc. that come with it, even though he has a nationality and proper documents of his own, and has no problems as such; he is only doing this to serve some materialistic interests. What is the ruling on this action?",,"Praise be to Allah.This action is haraam. It is not permissible for a person to claim to belong to anyone other than his father, because this leads to further lies, and has an impact on matters of inheritance, who is considered to be a mahram, and all other issues that have to do with lineage. Thus the texts issue stern warnings to those who claim to belong to anyone other than their fathers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever claims to belong to anyone other than his father on him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all the people.
(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104). This action is also a major sin comprised of two major sins, lying in order to consume wealth unlawfully and claiming to belong to someone other than one's father.
This person has to go back to what is true, and give up the nationality he aquired improperly. He should go back to using his proper documents that prove his real lineage. This is obligatory upon him. I am astounded that anyone would do such a thing for worldly gains. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whome We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (- far away from Allaahs Mercy). [al-Isra 17:18]
The one who does this had to repent to Allaah, and Allaah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95 interpretation of the meaning]. With regard to whatever money he has taken as a result of having that nationality, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba [usury] shall not be punished for the past [al-Baqarah 2:275]. This aayah is speaking about the one who consumes riba (interest or usury), so it applies even more in the case of lesser sins. And Allaah knows best."

    used to do this, using vessels such as plates and the like. If someone does this, he has a

In the Name of Allah, Asalamu alaikum:
What is the legal ruling of men wearing jewelery that is 18k gold ""electroplated"" such as watches, belts, rings, etc.",,"Praise be to Allah.Wearing gold is haraam for men.
‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a gold ring on a man’s hand. He took it off and threw it aside, saying, ""Would any of you take a burning coal and hold it in his hand?"" When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had gone away, someone said to the man, ""Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e., sell it)."" He said, ""No, by Allah, I will not take it after the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has thrown it away."" (reported by Muslim, no. 2090).
‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al’Aas reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever of my ummah wears gold and dies wearing it, Allah will deny him the gold of Paradise. Whoever of my ummah wears silk and dies wearing it, Allah will deny him the silk of Paradise."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad).
This prohibition applies to men only, not to women, as ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, and said: ""These are forbidden for the males of my ummah."" (reported by al-Nisaa’i and Abu Dawud).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: ""Wearing silk and gold is permitted for the women of my ummah and prohibited for the males."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad)
Gold is permitted for women because of their delicate and gentle nature, and their need for adornment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""(Do they then like for Allah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing gold and silk ornaments, i.e., women), and in dispute cannot make herself clear?"" [al-Zukhruf 43:18]
As for men, it is a sign of instability and an unmasculine nature to adorn oneself with gold. Islaam wants the differences between the sexes to be marked clearly, and their distinct characteristics to stand out, because when they resemble one another, much corruption results therefrom. The prohibition of gold for men includes pure gold, gold alloys, cut pieces, joined pieces, gold inlay, etc. As for gold-plating and gilding, some scholars are of the opinion that such articles are forbidden for men if it is possible to extract gold from them (by peeling or shaving off, for example); if no gold can be extracted from it, then such items are permitted. Some scholars say that it is not permitted to wear an item which is wholly or mostly gold-plated, but if only a little part of it is gold-plated (like the hands of a watch, or the numerals, or the tiny points denoting numbers), then it is permitted to wear it. They say that the issue is its appearance, not its value: if the gold-plating is very obvious and covers everything, it is not permitted, because many people will not make the distinction between gold-plate and real gold, and some may follow this person’s example and begin to wear pure gold.

What I advise you to do is to put your trust in Allaah and hasten to remarry. Nothing will harm 
you so long as you put your trust in Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): "". . .

twice."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 6133).
Something that may help you not to worry is the fact that it appears from your question that the 
fault lay with your ex-wife, and not with you. So you must strive to recite the verses of the 
Quraan which offer protection (muawwidhaat i.e., Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Naas)

and wipe your face and body with your hands.

If a person does not pronounce the Shahaadatayn and enter Islam, we cannot say that he is a Muslim, even if he admired Islam and recognized that it the best religion, a great religion, and so on.

""I do know that the religion of Muhammad is better than all other religions of mankind;
were it not for fear of blame or slander, you would find me accepting it completely.""
If a person accepts Islam out of conviction, and begins to practise it, then he is a Muslim, even if he does not register his Islam officially, or go to a court or Islamic centre to obtain documentation, or announce it to others.

I have a bad temper, if I get mad or upset, I move away from the situation, when I was standing I would sit down, when I was sitting I would lie down, and I have recited the ""darud"" and ""laholawallah kuwatta"", but to no avail.
How does one control their temper then?","This is how to control anger in Islam: Seeking refuge with Allah, keeping silent, not moving, knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness, listening to reminders, knowing the bad effects of anger, and making du`a.","Praise be to Allah.How to control anger
Anger is one of the evil whispers of Shaytan, which leads to so many evils and tragedies, of which only Allah knows their full extent. For this reason Islam has a great deal to say about this bad characteristic, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described cures for this ""disease"" and ways to limit its effects, among which are the following:
Seeking refuge with Allah from the Shaytan
Sulayman ibn Sard said: ""I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and two men were slandering one another. One of them was red in the face, and the veins on his neck were standing out. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he feels would go away. If he said ""I seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan,"" what he feels (i.e., his anger) would go away.’"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 6/337)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If a man gets angry and says, ‘I seek refuge with Allah ,’ his anger will go away."" (Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, no. 695)
Keeping silent
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 1/329; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 693, 4027)

This is because, in most cases, the angry person loses self-control and could utter words of kufr/disbelief (from which we seek refuge with Allah), or curses, or the word of divorce (talaq) which would destroy his home, or words of slander which would bring him the enmity and hatred of others. So, in short, keeping silent is the solution which helps one to avoid all that.
Not moving
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.""

The narrator of this hadith is Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is a story connected to his telling of it: he was taking his camels to drink at a trough that he owned, when some other people came along and said (to one another), ""Who can compete with Abu Dharr (in bringing animals to drink) and make his hair stand on end?"" A man said, ""I can,"" so he brought his animals and competed with Abu Dharr, with the result that the trough was broken. [i.e., Abu Dharr was expecting help in watering his camels, but instead the man misbehaved and caused the trough to be broken]. Abu Dharr was standing, so he sat down, then he laid down. Someone asked him, ""O Abu Dharr, why did you sit down then lie down?"" He said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: . . ."" and quoted the hadith. (The hadith and this story may be found in Musnad Ahmad, 5/152; see also Sahih al-Jami’, no. 694).

According to another report, Abu Dharr was watering his animals at the trough, when another man made him angry, so he sat down . . . (Fayd al-Qadir, al-Manawi, 1/408)

Among the benefits of this advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the fact that it prevents the angry person from going out of control, because he could strike out and injure someone, or even kill - as we will find out shortly - or he could destroy possessions and so on. Sitting down makes it less likely that one will become overexcited. Lying down makes it even less likely that he will do something crazy or harmful.
Al-’Allamah al-Khattabi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his commentary on Abu Dawud:
""One who is standing is in a position to strike and destroy, while the one who is sitting is less likely to do that, and the one who is lying down can do neither. It is possible that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the angry person to sit down or lie down so that he would not do something that he would later regret. And Allah knows best."" (Sunan Abi Dawud, with Ma'alim al-Sunan, 5/141)
Following the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ""Advise me."" He said, ""Do not become angry."" The man repeated his request several times, and each time the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him, ""Do not become angry."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 10/456)

According to another report, the man said: ""I thought about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and I realized that anger combines all kinds of evil."" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/373)
Do not become angry and Paradise will be yours 
This is an authentic hadith. (See Sahih al-Jami’, 7374. Ibn Hijr attributed it to al-Tabarani, see al-Fath 4/465)
Remembering what Allah has promised to the righteous (muttaqin) who keep away from the causes of anger and struggle within themselves to control it, is one of the most effective ways of extinguishing the flames of anger. One of the hadiths that describe the great reward for doing this is: ""Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will fill his heart with contentment on the Day of Resurrection."" (Reported by al-Tabarani, 12/453, see also Sahih al-Jami’, 6518).

Another great reward is described in the Prophet’s words: ""Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will call him before all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, and will let him choose of the Hur al-’Iyn whoever he wants."" (Reported by Abu Dawud, 4777, and others. It is classified as hasan (sound) in Sahih al-Jami’, 6518)
Knowing the high status and advantages offered to those who control themselves
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The strong man is not the one who can overpower others (in wrestling); rather, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he gets angry."" (Reported by Ahmad, 2/236; the hadith is agreed upon). 
The greater the anger, the higher the status of the one who controls himself. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The strongest man is the one who, when he gets angry and his face reddens and his hackles rise, is able to defeat his anger."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 5/367, and classified as hasan in Sahih al-Jami’, 3859)

Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by some people who were wrestling. He asked, ""What is this?"" They said: ""So-and-So is the strongest, he can beat anybody."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""Shall I not tell you who is even stronger than him? The man who, when he is mistreated by another, controls his anger, has defeated his own shaytan and the shaytan of the one who made him angry."" (Reported by al-Bazzar, and Ibn Hijr said its isnad is sahih. Al-Fath, 10/519)
Following the Prophet’s example in the case of anger
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is our leader and has set the highest example in this matter, as is recorded in a number of hadiths. One of the most famous was reported by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he was wearing a Najrani cloak with a rough collar. A Bedouin came and seized him roughly by the edge of his cloak, and I saw the marks left on his neck by the collar. Then the Bedouin ordered him to give him some of the wealth of Allah that he had. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he should be given something."" (Agreed upon. Fath al-Bari, 10/375)

Another way in which we can follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is by making our anger for the sake of Allah, when His rights are violated. This is the kind of anger which is praiseworthy. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became angry when he was told about the imam who was putting people off the prayer by making it too long; when he saw a curtain with pictures of animate creatures in ‘Aishah’s house; when Usamah spoke to him about the Makhzumi woman who had been convicted of theft, and he said ""Do you seek to intervene concerning one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?""; when he was asked questions that he disliked, and so on. His anger was purely for the sake of Allah.
Knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness
The righteous (al-muttaqun) are those praised by Allah in the Quran and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Paradise as wide as heaven and earth has been prepared for them. One of their characteristics is that they (interpretation of the meaning) ""spend (in Allah’s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, [they] repress anger, and [they] pardon men; verily, Allah loves al-muhsinun (the good-doers)."" [Al ‘Imran 3:134]

These are the ones whose good character and beautiful attributes and deeds Allah has mentioned, and whom people admire and want to emulate. One of their characteristics is that (interpretation of the meaning) "". . . when they are angry, they forgive."" [al-Shura 42:37]
Listening to reminders
Anger is a part of human nature, and people vary in their anger. It may be difficult for a man not to get angry, but sincere people will remember Allah when they are reminded, and they will not overstep the mark. Some examples follow:

Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man sought permission to speak to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), then he said: ""O son of al-Khattab, you are not giving us much and you are not judging fairly between us."" ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was so angry that he was about to attack the man, but al-Hurr ibn Qays, who was one of those present, said: ""O Amir al-Mu’minin, Allah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish’ [al-A’raf 7:199]. This man is one of the foolish."" By Allah, ‘Umar could go no further after al-Hurr had recited this ayah to him, and he was a man who was careful to adhere to the Book of Allah. (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 4/304)

This is how the Muslim should be. The evil hypocrite was not like this when he was told the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one of the Companions said to him, ""Seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan."" He said to the one who reminded him, ""Do you think I am crazy? Go away!"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1/465). We seek refuge with Allah from failure.
Knowing the bad effects of anger
The negative effects of anger are many; in short they cause damage to one’s own self and to others. The angry person may utter words of slander and obscenity, he may attack others (physically) in an uncontrolled manner, even to the point of killing. The following story contains a valuable lesson:

`Alqamah ibn Wail reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) told him: ""I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came to him leading another man by a rope. He said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, this man killed my brother.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, ‘Did you kill him?’ He said, ‘Yes, I killed him.’ He asked, ‘How did you kill him?’ He said, ‘He and I were hitting a tree to make the leaves fall, for animal feed, and he slandered me, so I struck him on the side of the head with an axe, and killed him.’ . . ."" (Reported by Muslim, 1307, edited by al-Baqi)

Anger could lead to less than killing, such as wounding and breaking bones. If the one who caused the anger runs away, the angry person turns his anger on himself, so he may tear his clothes, or strike his cheeks, or have a fit, or fall unconscious, or he may break dishes and plates, or break furniture.

In the worst cases, anger results in social disasters and the breaking of family ties, i.e., divorce. Ask many of those who divorced their wives, and they will tell you: it was in a moment of anger. This divorce results in misery for the children, regret and frustration, a hard and difficult life, all as a result of anger. If they had remembered Allah, come to their senses, restrained their anger and sought refuge with Allah, none of this would have happened. Going against the shari’ah (Islamic law) only results in loss.

The damage to health that results from anger can only be described by doctors, such as thrombosis, high blood pressure, tachycardia (abnormally rapid heartbeat) and hyperventilation (rapid, shallow breathing), which can lead to fatal heart attacks, diabetes, etc. We ask Allah for good health.
The angry person should think about himself during moments of anger
If the angry person could see himself in the mirror when he is angry, he would hate himself and the way he looks. If he could see the way he changes, and the way his body and limbs shake, how his eyes glare and how out of control and crazy his behaviour is, he would despise himself and be revolted by his own appearance. It is well-known that inner ugliness is even worse than outer ugliness; how happy the Shaytan must be when a person is in this state! We seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from failure.
Du`a (Supplication)
Du`a is always the weapon of the believer, whereby he asks Allah to protect him from evil, trouble and bad behaviour and seeks refuge with Him from falling into the pit of kufr (disbelief) or wrongdoing because of anger. One of the three things that can help save him is: being fair at times of contentment and of anger (Sahih al-Jami’, 3039). One of the Du`as of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was:

""O Allah, by Your knowledge of the Unseen and Your power over Your creation, keep me alive for as long as You know life is good for me, and cause me to die when You know death is good for me. O Allah, I ask You to make me fear You in secret and in public, and I ask You to make me speak the truth in times of contentment and of anger. I ask You not to let me be extravagant in poverty or in prosperity. I ask You for continuous blessings, and for contentment that does not end. I ask You to let me accept Your decree, and for a good life after death. I ask You for the joy of seeing Your face and for the longing to meet You, without going through diseases and misguiding fitnah (trials). O Allah, adorn us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who are guided. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.""

                Assalamu Alaikum , my question is I have

      not to exceed on this card what I could pay for every month so that I would not have to
      pay any interest. During one time of some difficulty I could not pay the entire bill and
      it incured the interest. After several months I was able to pay it off with the help of my

      wanted to get rid of the card so that we would not risk falling into this condition again.
      However my husband wanted me to apply for a card in his name since I was planning to gat
      rid of mine. He had previously had 2 credit cards of his own which he was unable to pay
      off. He became very angry and insulting, so to keep the peace I got it for him. He also
      said that he would be responsible for it if he couldn't pay it. I have not used the card
      at all and for the past 6 months he has not been able to pay the entire balance so for all
      that time it is gathering interest. my question is who is accountable before Allah for
      this card? Me because I gat it for him Or Him because he asked for it .

the options that I have. 
I thank you tremendously for you time.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah
You have two options;
Your first option is: The woman must be a chaste kitaabiyya (be among people of the 
book, i.e. Christian or Jewish), and in that case you can marry her following what 
Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
""and chaste women among the believers and chaste women among those who were 
given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)"" Al-Maidah 4:5.
The second option you have is that she converts to Islam and then you marry her.
Otherwise, remember the hell fire, and remember what Allaah said in the Quraan 
(interpretation of the meaning): 
""And do not marry Al-Mushrikat ( idolatresses, etc.) until they believe ( worship Allaah 
alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah 
(idolatress, etc.) even though she pleases you. And give not your daughters in 
marriage to Al-Mushrikoon until they believe (in Allaah alone) and verily, a believing 
slave is better than a (free) Mushrik ( idolater, etc.), even though he pleases you. They 
(Al-Mushrikoon) invite you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and 
Forgiveness by His leave, and makes His aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, 
signs, revelations) clear to mankind so that they may remember "". Al-Baqarah, verse 
#2:221 
The meaning of ""a slave woman who believes is better than a non-believer"" is simply 
that she is better than a non-believer who is (free) even if the non-believer pleases you, 
even if she pleases you, EVEN IF SHE PLEASES YOU!
We ask Allaah to show you the truth, and to guide you back to it. May the peace and

244,673,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/673,Calling aathaan inside the masjid or prayer room,"Question

                Is it against the Sunnah to call the adhan inside the Musallah? I believe the 
way of the Salaf is to call it from the tallest structure/house near the masjid or 
the masjid itself.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with calling the athaan in the musallah; on the 
contrary, it is better than abandoning it altogether. Prophet Muhammad  (peace be 
upon him) taught two men who were traveling how to make the call for prayer while 
traveling, where no mosques or musallahs may be found. As was narrated in the 
hadeeth saheah by Malik Ibn Al-Huwayrith: ""My cousin and I came to the Prophet 
SAWS and he said to us, ‘If you travel, (meaning while you are traveling) perform the 
call for prayer, and call the iqamah before prayer and let the older one of you be the 
Imam."" Narrated by Al Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari hadeeth #658 and Al Tirmidhi, hadeeth 
#189. According to Abu Eissa (Al Tirmidhi) this hadeeth is hasan saheeh. There were 
two views on the hadeeth. The majority of the Muslim scholars agreed on the validity of 
calling the aathaan while traveling. Others however, have said that the iqamah alone is 
sufficient, and that the purpose of the aathaan is to gather people for prayer. According 
to Ahmad and Ishaaq, the first view is more sound. 
In another Hadeeth narrated by ‘Ukbah bin ‘Aamir he said: I heard the Prophet  say, 
""Allaah is pleased by a shepherd who, while on the top of a mountain, calls for prayer 
and prays. Allaah the Almighty says, ‘Look at my worshipperhe calls the aathaan, 
and he prays; he fears me. I have forgiven my worshipper, and I have sent him to 
heaven ( meaning that Allah chose for this person to go to heaven).’"" Narrated by 
Al-Nisaa’i, Abu Dawood, and Ahmad and was confirmed sound by Al Albany in his 
book Saheeh Al-Jami’, Hadeeth #8102.
The benefits of the aathaan are many and they are by no means limited to gathering 
people, or announcing prayer time. They encompass: repelling Satan, getting rewarded 
in the afterlife for calling for prayer, and furthermore, for announcing and repeating the 
oneness of Allaah, etc.

If the son will commit haraam acts if he does not get married, then the father has no 
right to prevent him from getting married for the reason stated in the question. Allaah

""And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and a 
woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the saalihoon (pious, fit and 
capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be 
poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His 
creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people).""
[al-Noor 24:32]
The Messenger of Allaah 
 said: ""There are three to whom Allaah’s help is due: the 
mujaahid who goes out to fight for the sake of Allaah; the slaves who makes a

is a hasan hadeeth. See also Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3050).

  the first time, and wants to invite her friends for a celebration on this occasion. What
  should she write on the invitation cards?",,"Praise be to Allah.
This is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim
country and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a
sign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the
purposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small
gathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl’s friends, tell
them of her achievement in completing the Qur’aan in order to encourage them - not to
show off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the
Qur’aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the
Qur’aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and
give thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one
is careful not to let it turn into a celebration. 
It is clear from the above that celebrating a person’s completion of reciting or
memorizing the Qur’aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which
there is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): 
(1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and 
(2) that it may constitute bid’ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part
of the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the
Qur’aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere
towards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and
friends. 
We should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah
I ask Allaah to increase His blessings upon you and to give you the strength to memorize
Qur’aan and Sincerity in speech and deeds."

claims that under an Islamic state if a born Muslim converts to another religion he 
is killed. Please tell me if this is true.",,"Praise be to Allah.
The punishment for apostasy (riddah) is well-known in Islaamic Sharee’ah. The one who leaves 
Islaam will be asked to repent by the Sharee’ah judge in an Islaamic country; if he does not 
repent and come back to the true religion, he will be killed as a kaafir and apostate, because of 
the command of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): ""Whoever 
changes his religion, kill him."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3017).
It is well-known in Sharee’ah that the punishments (hudood) are not carried out on minors, 
because they have not yet reached the age of responsibility; but in the case of those who have 
reached the age of responsibility, the punishment (hadd) applies, without a doubt.
The person who knows the truth and believes in it, then turns his back on it, does not deserve 
to live. The punishment for apostasy is prescribed for the protection of the religion and as a 
deterrent to anyone who is thinking of leaving Islaam. There is no doubt that such a serious 
crime must be met with an equally weighty punishment. If the kuffaar do not give people the 
freedom to cross a red light, how can we give freedom to people to leave Islaam and disbelieve 
in Allaah when they want to? 
It seems that the intention of the teacher mentioned in the question was to shock the students 
with news of this ruling, in order to mislead them from the way of Allaah. You must respond 
and explain to him and the other students as much as you can. 
May Allaah make you and us bearers of His Message and defenders of His Sharee’ah."

Because of the insults that you suffered, there is nothing wrong with what you did, in

her the opportunity to think about what she has done. 
Al-‘Allaamah al’Safaareeni, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book Ghidhaa’ 
al-Albaab: ""Ibn Abi Hamzah said: ‘The ties of kinship may be by money, by helping at 
times of need, by warding off harm, by meeting them with a smiling face, and by 
praying for them. The general meaning is that one helps them in good ways as much 
as possible and helps them to resist or fight evil as much as possible. This is the case 
if one’s relatives are righteous, but if they are kaafirs or are wrongdoers, then cutting 
off ties with them for the sake of Allaah is how one maintains the tie, on the condition 
that one tries to warn them, and tells them that the reason for cutting the ties is 
because of their deviation from the truth. At the same time, the connection of making 
du’aa’ for them should remain, and you should pray for them in their absence that 
Allaah will guide them to the Right Path. (al-Tuhfah: Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 1/356).

It brought us great joy to hear from the noble inquirer expressing interest in accepting Islam.  
Islam is indeed the religion that links the human being to his Lord directly via the belief in the oneness of God and through various acts of worship.  
Alsoو Islam instills peace of mind and an inner serenity to the created human being, embodied in a unique relationship and devout tranquillity, encompassing love for, fear of, hope from, and submission to God Almighty, Allah. 
Indeed, this essence is the true meaning of worship, which comprises and combines acts of the heart with acts of the tongue in remembering God, in addition to the acts of the physical organs.  
This is manifested through prayer, fasting, paying zakah (the poor due), and reading the Noble Quran, among other acts, which you will find resulting in positive and benevolent effects in yourself, God willing (in sha Allah).  
No doubt that if you decide to accept Islam that the conclusion which you will have reached was due to two things: (1) a sound mind and (2) success granted from God (Allah).

Is it permissible to breastfeed a child over 2 years old? Until what age does breast-feeding make the child a relative (mahram)? Are there any exceptions to this rule?

                Can a non-muslim enter paradise, for example, a Christian who believes in God 
(believing Jesus is a prophet) and his prophets, excluding Mohammad  
 ?",,"Praise be to Allah.
The answer to this question is presumably quite clear to all Muslims, because it is one of the 
obvious matters of ‘aqeedah (belief).
In answer to this question, it is sufficient to quote one aayah and one hadeeth.
The aayah is (interpretation of the meaning): ""And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, 
it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" [Aal 
‘Imraan 3:85]
The hadeeth is: ""By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, there is no-one of this 
ummah, Jew or Christian, who hears of me then dies without believing in that with which I have 
been sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell."" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on 
him, in al-Saheeh, 153)."

  fornication, and the private parts commit fornication"". (It is reported 
  by Ahmad and it is in sahih Al Jahni 4150.)

  be stoned and the unmarried fornicator receive lashes. This is only if the sexual 
  organs of the fornicator penetrate the vagina of the woman. Whatever is similar 
  deserves a different punishment, depending on the level of the haram committed. 
  It is not obligatory that he admit to a judge what he did. It is sufficient 
  that repentance take place between him and Allah, and Allah is the Acceptor 
  of repentance and the Most Merciful. We ask Allah to forgive us and the rest 
  of the Muslims.

257,731,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/731,"Saying that
    specific people are going to Paradise or Hell","Question

                I have heard in certain lectures given by
      the shaikhs here in America who consider themselves Salafee, say things like this: My
      mother is a kafira and I KNOW she is going to hell. 
      Saying that they know for sure that a certain person is going to hell. 
      Is this permissible in Islam? Can we say that a certain person is going to Jahannam
      because of their religion?",,"Praise be to Allah.According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, the
    basic principle is that the issue of who will go to Paradise and who will go to Hell is
    the matter of ‘aqeedah based on what is said in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and
    there is no room for reasoning or ijtihaad in this matter.
If the Qur’aan or Sunnah says that a specific person will be in
    Paradise or Hell, we bear witness to that. At the same time we hope that those who do good
    will go to Paradise and fear that those who do bad will go to Hell, but Allaah knows best
    how people will end up.
The issue of saying who will go to Paradise or Hell may be divided into
    two categories:
General statements, which have to do with people’s qualities, such
        as saying, “Whoever associates anything with Allaah in an act of major shirk is a
        kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, and will be in Hell.”

Similarly we say that whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the
      hope of receiving reward will be forgiven his previous and future sins, and that an
      acceptable Hajj has no other reward but Paradise. There are many such statements in the
      Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah.
If a person asks, “Will the one who calls on anything other than
      Allaah and seeks the help of anyone but Allaah be in Paradise or Hell?” we would say
      that he is a kaafir who will be in Hell, if he is shown clear evidence that he is wrong
      but he stills persists and dies believing that.
If it were said, Whoever does Hajj then does not commit any obscene or
      immoral act, and dies after his Hajj, for example, what will his fate be? We would say
      that he is in Paradise. Or the person whose last words in this life are Laa ilaaha
      ill-Allaah will be in Paradise, and so on.
All of this has to do with people’s qualities and does not apply
      to any specific, named person.
Specific statements referring to people by name, stating that a
        particular person will be in Paradise or in Hell. This is not permissible except in cases
        where Allaah or His Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have informed
        us of it.
Whoever Allaah or His Messenger have mentioned by name and stated that
      they will be in Paradise are definitely among the people of Paradise, such as the ten who
      were given the good news of Paradise (al-‘asharah al-mubashsharah), foremost among
      whom are the four Khulafa’, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and
      ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with them.
Those who the Qur’aan and Sunnah mention by name and state that
      they will be in Hell are definitely among the people of Hell, such as Abu Lahab and his
      wife, Abu Taalib, ‘Amr ibn Lahiy, and others.
We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and
      Mercy. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
258,734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/734,Can You Read Surat Yasin for the Dead?,"Question

In my culture, people read Surat Yasin in groups before and after people die. I would like to know whether this is based on the Sunnah or an innovation?","Reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying has been reported from some of the Companions. Regarding reading Surat Yasin for the dead,  there is no sahih hadith to indicate that this should be done.","Praise be to Allah.Reading Yasin for one who is dying
We have to make a distinction here between the two issues: reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying, and reading it for one who has died. 
With regard to reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying, this practice has been reported from some of the Companions. 
Imam Ahmad reported in his Musnad from Safwan: “My shaykhs told me that they were with Ghudayf ibn al-Harith al-Thumani when he was dying. He said: ‘Can any of you read Yasin ?’ So Salih ibn Shurayh al-Sakuni recited it, and when he reached the fortieth verse, Ghudayf passed away. My shaykhs used to say that when it is recited in the presence of one who is dying, it eases the pain of death.” That was the opinion of Safwan. ‘Isa ibn al-Mu’tamir read it for Ibn Mab’ad (when the latter was dying).” (Al-Musnad, 16355)
Al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil, 3/152: “This is a sahih sanad going back to Ghudayf ibn al-Harith, may Allah be pleased with him. Its men are thiqat apart from ‘the shaykhs’ who are not named and are therefore unknown (majhul). But the fact that they are unknown is compensated for by their large number, especially since they are of the generation of the Tabi’in (Successors)…”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ fi Ahkam al-Janaiz: “Surat Yasin may be recited over him (i.e., the one who is dying) for the one who thinks that the hadith is correct.” He explained that this is because this surah contains good news of Paradise, as in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “It was said: ‘Enter Paradise.’…” [Yasin 36:26], and because it makes the passage of the soul easier, and other reasons.
Reading Surat Yasin for the dead
As regards reading Surat Yasin for one who has died, there is no sahih hadith to indicate that this should be done. A hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud and others which says “Read Yasin over your dead”, but this hadith is not sahih because its isnad contains contradictions and narrators who are unknown (majhul). This was stated by al-‘Allamah al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, hadith no. 688. 
Reading Quran over the dead is considered to be a bid`ah (innovation), as he states at the end of his book Ahkam al-Janaiz.
Some people think that it should be read forty times over the deceased, and some of them may distribute copies of the Quran among the mourners who gather to offer condolences so that they may read, or organize gatherings in the mosque to read it for the soul of the deceased. All of this has no basis whatsoever (in the sunnah), and these are innovated deeds of bid`ah which we should avoid and warn others against. And Allah is the Source of strength.

  Secondly, if this lady becomes a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Christian 
  or Jewish), repents to Allaah for the forbidden relationship, and remains chaste, 
  then it is permissible for you to marry her.
  Thirdly, the children who were born to this woman outside of marriage are not 
  your children; they cannot take your name and must take her name. However, this 
  should not prevent you from treating them kindly, taking care of them and spending 
  on them. In the future, you should try to call them and their mother to Islaam.
  Fourthly, going to her church and attending rituals of kufr is not advisable, 
  because of the possible negative consequences. We advise you not to do that, 
  but this should not be any obstacle to your entering Islam. If you were to say 
  that it is a choice of either embracing Islam and going to the church with her, 
  or not embracing Islam at all, we would definitely tell you to embrace Islam. 
  But we would like you to think of the meaning of these two soorahs of the Qur'aan 
  (interpretation of the meanings):
  ""Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.
  Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need; He neither 
  eats nor drinks).

  And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping.
  Nor will you worship that which I worship
  To you be your religion, and to me my religion (Islaamic monotheism).""[al-Kaafiroon 109:1-6]
  Finally I advise you, a wise man who is striving to make the right choice, hasten 
  to enter Islam and practise it: Allaah will help you to overcome all obstacles.

After one year, you can take your million back. Is this considered to be ribaa or not? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you.",,"Praise be to Allah.This 
          is the essence of ribaa, and is not permitted under any circumstances, 
          because the purpose of lending is to help Muslims. It was narrated from 
          Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a loan is like an 
          act of charity. If the bank lends you one million riyaals for a period 
          of one year, and after that year passes you return the million that 
          you borrowed and add another million for them to keep for a year in 
          return for their loan to you, this is haraam according to the consensus 
          of the Muslim scholars. The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every loan which 
          brings benefits is ribaa.” (this version narrated by al-Baghawi). The

          one million more than what is due to them, so that they can buy and 
          sell with it and keep the profits for themselves. This condition brings 
          benefits, so it is an invalid condition according to the consensus of 
          the Muslim scholars. All that you have to do is to give the bank the 
          million that you borrowed from them, and not another million to benefit 
          from for a year. This is not permissible according to the consensus 
          of the Muslim scholars. The bank is not entitled to anything except 
          getting its money back, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“O 
          you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to 
          you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. 
And 
          if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messengerbut if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal

Why are adultery, gambling, eating the flesh of swine forbidden in Islam or consedered ""haram""?",,"Praise be to Allah.Even though we find it strange that a Muslim would ask such a question about matters which are so clear and undisputed, the answer is simply that these things are haraam because Allaah, Whom we must obey, has forbidden them. He tells us in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meanings):
“And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil way.” [al-Israa’ 17:32]
“He has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine…” [al-Baqarah 2:173]
“O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [stone altars for sacrifice to false gods], and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah. So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maa’idah 5:90-91]
So we must avoid all that which Allaah has forbidden, out of faith in His laws, in the hope of His reward and in fear of His punishment. We must also believe that Allaah does not forbid anything in Islamic sharee’ah except that which is harmful and corrupt, whether we understand this rationally or not, because He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:65]"

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Allah loves the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning .

As far as it's appointed time, my dear respected questioner, the laws of worship in Islam are 
scheduled according to proof which is clearly traceable and detectable. The evidence which is 
seen is not estimated. This entails the sighting of the moon, which indicates that the month of 
Ramadhan has begun. So, if we see the new moon, or it is established that someone amongst us 
has seen the new moon, then it becomes obligatory on the entire Muslim community to fast every 
day of this month, until we see the new moon for the following month of Shawwal and know that 
therefore Ramadhan has ended.
The month of Ramadhan on the Islamic calendar could be 29 or 30 days depending on the 
sighting of the physical proof, which is the new moon. According to the Christian calender, the 
approximate time of Ramadhan this year would occur on the 30th or 31st of December 1997.
In order for your fast to be correct and accepted, you must first enter Islam by testifying to 
Allah's Oneness and believing in the Prophet and following the laws of Islam. We would be 
happy to see you living a happy life with strong faith, and good years to come, spending them 
inspired by Islam. We ask Allah to protect you and guide you along."

                I am not a muslim but have respect and faith for the religion. Though 
non-muslims are regarded as non-believers I do believe in ALLAH, but will 
not be able to convert because my mother, who is unwell, might not be able 
to bear losing her only daughter.I am in love with a muslim man and we 
want to get married. I have promised with my sincerest intentions that if we 
do get married and have children, they will follow Islam. Is there any way of 
us getting married without me converting and I would also appreciate if I 
could be told where I can read more on this subject.  Thank You.",,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. 
To the noble inquirer: 
You have traversed an important part of 
  the path to the truth and directing yourself towards it.  From what I have 
  been able to gather from your question, I understand that you wish to embrace 
  Islam but what is preventing you from doing so is fear for your sick mother's 
  health upon hearing the news.  I want you to know that overcoming this 
  obstacle is an easy matter, as it is possible for you in a practical way, to 
  conceal your acceptance of Islam and not divulge it.  You are not required 
  to announce your acceptance of Islam in an Islamic center or anywhere else; 
  all that is required is the pronouncing of the two testimonies of faith (see 
  question(s) ) and the initiation of practicing the rites of the religion.  
  You can pray in private, undisclosed places, for example.  In addition, 
  fasting will not be difficult as you can easily advance any appropriate excuse 
  for not eating if something is offered to you during the daylight hours of the 
  month of fasting. 
Now, I would like to remind you of two 
  things: 
Firstly, that the driving factor and underlying 
  truth regarding wanting to embrace the religion must be to gain the pleasure 
  and acceptance of your Lord--Allaah, the Most Glorified and All-High, who does 
  not accept any religion other than Islam, as He has said in his Glorious Book 
  (the Qur'aan), [interpretation of the meaning]: ""And whoever seeks a religion 
  other than Islam--it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he 
  will be among the losers."" (The Family of Imran, verse 3:85)  It has 
  been narrated by Abu Hurairah, may Allaah be please with him, that Allaah's 
  Messenger  (peace be upon him) said: ""By 
  Him in whose hand Muhammad's  soul is (i.e., 
  God, Allaah), there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these 
  present nations to whom I have been sent) who hears about me and then dies without 
  believing in the message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islamic monotheism), 
  but he will be among the dwellers of the Hellfire."" (Sahih Muslim, Book 
  of Faith, #240). 
Thus, your objectives in entering Islam 
  are to save yourself from being among the permanent dwellers of Hell in the 
  Hereafter, and to achieve the fantastic reward of the bliss of Heaven, the vastness 
  of which is greater than that of the earth and the skies.  Your overriding 
  motive for accepting Islam should not be emotions stemming from your relationship 
  with the Muslim man with whom you are in love.  Your embracing Islam is 
  something necessary for yourself whether you marry this man or not. 
Secondly, obeying God (Allaah) and His 
  Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) has a 
  higher priority than your closest relative and most beloved dear one even if 
  it is your mother or your spouse or anyone else.  The Prophet of guidance 
  has said  :  ""There are three qualities, 
  for which whoever is characterized by them will relish the sweetness of faith:  
  one to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; one who loves 
  a man only for Allaah's sake; and one who abhors returning to apostasy after 
  Allaah has rescued him from it as he abhors being cast into Hell."" (Sahih 
  al-Bukhari, Book of Faith, #15). 
He  also 
  said:  ""No worshipper (and in the hadeeth narrated by 'Abdul-Warith, 
  no person) is a truthful believer, until I am dearer to him than the members 
  of his household, his wealth and the whole of mankind."" (Sahih al-Bukhari, 
  Book of Faith #14). 
I ask Allaah to hasten you to Islam and 
  to help you firmly establish yourself in it, and to grant you a righteous and 
  successful marriage as well as a blessed family.  Indeed, Allaah is the 
  One who guides to the path of truth, success, and righteousness.

268,762,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/762,Ruling on wearing one’s clothes below one’s ankles,"Question

                Assalamu Alaikum
A brother was telling me that wearing clothing below the ankles is haram and that 
there are many hadiths that prove this. I would appreciate your opinion on this 
matter.
Jazakallah",,"Praise be to Allah.
What your friend has told you is true. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet 
 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid isbaal (wearing ones clothes below 
the ankles), for example:
Al-Bukhaari reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
said: ""Whatever of the izaar (lower garment) is below the ankles is in the Fire."" (al-Bukhaari, no. 
5787)
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""There are three whom 
Allaah will not look at or praise on the Day of Judgement and theirs will be a painful 
punishment: the one who wears his garment below his ankles, the one who reminds others of his 
favours, and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths"" (reported by Muslim, 
no. 106)
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Isbaal (wearing ones 
garment below the ankles) may apply to the izaar (lower garment), the shirt or the turban. 
Whoever allows any part of these to trail on the ground out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at 
him on the Day of Judgement."" (reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4085, and al-Nisaai, no. 5334, with a saheeh 
isnaad).
Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
said: ""Allaah will not look at the one who wears his lower garment below his ankles."" (Reported by 
al-Nisaai in al-Mujtabaa, Kitaab al-Zeenah, Baab Isbaal al-Izaar).
Hudhayfah said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) took hold of the muscle of my calf (or his calf) and said, This is where the izaar should 
stop; if you insist, it may be lower, but it should not reach the ankles."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who 
said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; see Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 1783)
All of the ahaadeeth quoted above speak against isbaal, whether or not the intention is to show 
off; but if a person does this deliberately out of arrogance, there is no doubt that his sin is 
greater. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Allaah will not 
look at the one who trails his izaar on the ground out of pride."" (al-Bukhaari, no. 5788)
Jaabir ibn Sulaym said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
upon him) said to me: Beware of wearing ones lower garment below the ankles, because this is 
a kind of showing-off, and Allaah does not love showing-off."" (Regarded as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 
no. 2722).
No one is able to be completely free of pride and arrogance, even if he claims that this is so. 
Such a claim is unacceptable, because by saying it, he is praising himself. Only in the case of 
those whom the wahy (revelation) testified that they were free of pride do we believe that this is 
the case. For example, there is a hadeeth which states that the Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, 
Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection."" Abu Bakr said to him, ""O Messenger 
of Allaah, my izaar slips down if I do not pay attention to it."" He said: ""You are not one of 
those who do it out of pride."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5784)
What indicates that isbaal is prohibited even if it is not done out of pride is the hadeeth of Abu 
Saeed al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The lower garment of the Muslim should 
come down to mid-calf, but there is nothing wrong if it is between that point and the ankles. 
Whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire. Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of 
pride, Allaah will not look at him."" (Reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4093, with a saheeh isnaad.)
These ahaadeeth describe two different deeds, for which there will be two different 
punishments:
Imaam Ahmad reported that Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Yaqoob said: ""I asked Abu Saeed: Did 
you hear anything from the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
upon him) concerning the izaar (lower garment)? he said, Yes, listen! The izaar of the 
believer should come to mid-calf, although there is nothing wrong if it comes between there and 
the ankles, but whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire, and he said it three times.""
Ibn Umar said: ""I passed by the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah 
be upon him), and my izaar had slipped down. He said, O Abdullaah, pull up your izaar! so 
I pulled it up. He said, More! so I pulled it up more, and always made sure it was pulled up 
properly after that."" Some people asked, ""To where did you pull it up?"" He said, ""To mid-calf 
length."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2086; al-Dhahabi, Kitaab al-Kabaair, 131-132) 
The issue of isbaal applies to women just as much as it applies to men. This is indicated by the 
hadeeth of Ibn Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever trails his garment on the 
ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him. Umm Salamah said: O Messenger of Allaah, 
what should women do with their hems? He said, Let them go down a handspan. She asked, 
What if their feet show? He said, Let them lengthen it by a cubit, but no more."" (al-Nisaa'i, 
Kitaab al-zeenah, Baab dhuyool al-nisaa).
The punishment for showing off may come to pass in this world, not in the Hereafter. Abu 
Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) said: ""Whilst a man was walking arrogantly admiring himself and his clothes, Allaah 
caused the earth to swallow him and he is suffering in it until the Day of Resurrection."" (Reported 
by Muslim, no. 2088)."
269,763,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/763,What Benefits the Dead and Can They Hear Those Who Visit?,"Question

My father passed away about two weeks ago. I wanted to know when me or my family members go to his grave, is he able to hear us and what we are saying to him? ...  And if not, is there any way we can have him hear what we say?","What benefits the dead is the following: 1- Offering charity on his behalf, 2- beneficial knowledge which the deceased has left behind, and 3- a righteous child who will make du`a for him.","Praise be to Allah.Can the dead hear the living?
The principle is that the dead do not hear the words of the living, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""but you cannot make hear those in the graves."" [Fatir 35:22] and ""Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear"" [al-Naml 27:80]
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed the slain disbelievers after the Battle of Badr, Allah caused them to hear his words, although they were at the bottom of the well in which they had been buried. This was a special case, as the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, have stated. (See Al-Ayat al-Bayyinat fi ‘adam Sama’ al-Amwat).
Perhaps the psychological motive for wishing that your father could hear you is an attempt to do something to re-establish the communication that has been cut, in order to alleviate the pain you are feeling. 
What benefits the dead in Islam?
You should understand, my sister, that Islam has explained what actions on the part of the living may benefit the dead, and what may reach them in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity, e.g. a waqf or endowment), beneficial knowledge (which he has left behind), or a righteous child who will pray for him."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no 1376; he said this is a sahih hasan hadith)

The most important thing that will benefit your father after his death, and that you can do for him now that he is in his grave, is to strive to pray for him and ask for forgiveness and mercy for him, and for Paradise and salvation from the Fire, and other good and beautiful du`as (prayers).

Prayers for forgiveness offered by both sons and daughters of the deceased bring great benefits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""A man’s status will be raised in Paradise and he will ask, How did I get here? He will be told, By your son’s du’as (prayers) for forgiveness for you."" (Reported by Ibn Majah, no 3660; see also Sahih al-Jami, 1617)

Another thing that may reach the deceased is sadaqah (charity) given on his behalf, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""My mother has passed away, and if she could have spoken, she would have given something in charity. Will she receive a reward if I give something on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 1388)

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the mother of Sa’d ibn Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) died when he was away from her. He said: ""O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and I am away from her. Will it benefit her anything if I give in charity on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Then I ask you to be my witness that I am giving my garden al-Mikhraf (so called because it bore so many dates) in charity on her behalf."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 2756)
Abu Hurayrah reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""My father has died and left money behind. He did not make a wasiyyah (a will); will it expiate for his sins if I give some of it in charity on his behalf?"" He said, ""Yes."" (Reported by al-Nasai)
Sa'd ibn Ubadah said: ""I said: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died. Should I give charity on her behalf? He said, Yes. I asked, What kind of charity is best? He said, Providing water."" (Reported by al-Nasai)
Other deeds that may also benefit the dead

Other deeds that may also benefit the deceased are Hajj and ‘Umrah on their behalf, after the living person has first performed Hajj and ‘Umrah on his or her own behalf.

‘Abdullah ibn Buraydah reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""While I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a woman came to him and said: I gave my mother a slave-woman in charity, and now my mother has died. He said: You have got your reward, and your right of inheritance has brought your gift back to you. She said, O Messenger of Allah, she still had one month to fast. Can I fast it on her behalf? He said, Fast it on her behalf. She said, She never went to Hajj. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf? He said, Perform Hajj on her behalf."" (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, no. 1149)

This shows that it is also permissible to fast on behalf of the deceased.
Another thing that may benefit the deceased is to fulfil their nadhr (vow), because Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ""My mother made a vow to perform Hajj but she died before she could do it. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes, perform Hajj on her behalf. Don't you think that if your mother owed a debt you would pay it off?"" She said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Then pay off what is owed to Allah, for Allah is more deserving of having vows fulfilled."" (al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 7315)
Another thing that may benefit the deceased is if his relative devotes a share to him of a sacrifice he offers. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sacrifice, he said: ""In the name of Allah, O Allah, on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad"" (reported by Muslim, no. 1967) and the family of Muhammad included both the living and the dead.

The question of whether women may visit graves has already been addressed (please see question# 127 )
You should also know that keeping yourself busy with praying for your father is more important and better for you, and more beneficial to the deceased, than thinking about whether he can hear your voice. So try to do whatever will be of benefit both to him and you. You and your family should avoid forbidden innovations (bid’ah) such as marking the fortieth day after death, or the passing of one year since the death, or gatherings for reciting al-Fatihah (the first chapter of surah of the Quran), doing forbidden acts at graves, and so on, deeds which are done by those who are ignorant and are imitated by others.
I ask Allah to forgive your father and have mercy on him and on all the deceased Muslims, for He is the Forgiving, Most Merciful.

What is the ruling on touching the wife and the status of wudu? Does touching the wife cause breaking of wudu?",The strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu unless there is a discharge of sperm.,"Praise be to Allah.In this issue, the strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu, unless there is a discharge of sperm. This is the statement of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) and it is also from ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) as well as Hasan, Mujahid, and Qatadah. 
It is also of the madhhab of Abu Hanifah. Ibn Jarir supports this statement, as well as At-Tabari and Sheikh Al-Islam ibn Taimiyyah. 
The people who support this statement, use as proof the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, ""I was sleeping in front of the Messenger of Allah and my legs were in his qiblah. When he prostrated he touched me and I withdrew my legs, and when he stood I stretched them out"". (Homes in those days did not have lamps.) (Al-Bukhari,328)
They also use the hadith where `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) says, ""I noticed the Messenger of Allah was gone one evening from the bed, so I looked for him and my hand landed on the sole of his feet and he was in the mosque. They were close together and he was saying, ""O Allah I seek refuge with You, pleasure from Your anger, and with Your pardon, and from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from what is falsely attributed to You as praise. You are how You have praised Yourself"". (Muslim, 486)
An-Nawawi states in explaining this hadith that `Aisha’s statement, ""and my hand landed on the soles of his feet when he was in the mosque and they were close together,"" is proof for the one who says that touching the wife does not break wudu. 
Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah says the statement of Allah, ""Or ye have been in contact with women"" refers to sex as Ibn Abbas and others from the Arabs have said. It is reported by ‘Ali and others, and it is the correct meaning of the verse. 
There is nothing showing that touching one's wife breaks wudu in the Quran or Sunnah. The Muslims used to touch their wives all the time and not one of the Muslims reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered anyone to make wudu because of touching women .

The one and only religion that Allaah, the Most Gracious, accepts is Islam. This religion 
has one path, one direction and is based on one methodologythat which the Prophet 
of Islam Muhammad  (peace be upon him) followed along with his comrades. This 
religion which Allaah has chosen for mankind is not subdivided into different sects nor 
does it divert into different paths. However, a number of people have gone astray and 
corrupted the religion, forming many different groups that bear no relation to Islam, 
examples of which are Al-Baatiniya,, Al-Qadyaninya, and the Bahaa’iya, among which 
Allaah the Most Exalted and Glorious has warned us in the Holy Qur’aan:
"" And verily this (i.e. Allah’s commandments mentioned in the previous two verses 151 
and 152) is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will 
separate you from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-

As for the second part of the question, the noble inquirer must know that Islam came 
down from the heavens in the form of divine revelations and inspirations to the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him). Islam is the religion that Allaah has accepted for his 
worshippers, and has chosen it to mark the final completion of all that preceded it and 
thus supercede and be the seal for all religions. Therefore, it is not possible to say that 
Islam was influenced by other religions (as it was revealed by God, Allaah, the

His wife and children have even gone to the limits of taking my mother to court, and falsely bearing witness that she physically assaulted them and threatened to kill them. There are numerous things they do, but, my uncle after a few months fights with his children and comes back and asks my mother for forgiveness. She forgives him, and he starts pretending he is a maskin. But, he continues to support his children and wife who hurt my mother numerous times.
Anyway, I asked my mother NOT to talk to him anymore. She claims we have to forget and forgive. But, surely there are limitations. Anyway, is it wrong to ask my mother not to associate with him anymore? Is it wrong for me to continue to refuse to have anything to do with him or his family? I DO NOT wish to forget or forgive, especially, when there is no change in his behavior.
Any Advice is appreciated.","If you want to deal with your toxic family member on the basis of justice, then it is permissible for you to respond in like to his unkind words.

But if you bear it with patience, that will be better for you, as Allah says at the end of the same verse (interpretation of the meaning): ""But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for the patient ones."" [An-Nahl 16:126]

If you want to turn enmity into love, then treat him well, if he treats you badly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend."" [Fussilat 41:34]

The words, ""The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal"" mean that there is a huge difference between the two. ""Repel (the evil) with one which is better,"" means that when someone treats you badly, answer back with something better, as `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""There is no better punishment for the person who sinned by being bad to you, than your obeying Allah by being good to him in return."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)

A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off; I treat them well, but they treat me badly; I try to be kind to them, but they are cruel to me."" He said: ""If you are as you say, it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. You will continue to have support from Allah against them so long as you continue doing that."" (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2558)

Our advice to you, our sister, is to be tolerant and forgiving. Follow your mother's advice. It is clear from your question that this man has room to regret and retract his bad actions. Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah"" [Ash-Shura 42:40]

However, all of this does not prevent us from protecting ourselves from the evil and harm that such relatives may cause. If going to their houses, for example, will cause some kind of offence or harm, then the relationship can be limited to telephone calls, kind words, the occasional gift and so on. The relationship can be maintained at a distance, if being too close will cause problems.
We ask Allah to guide us all, to help us not to bear any grudges towards anyone, and to treat one another properly. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

                Assalaam alaikum
I am desiring to embrace Islam, however I have a slight concern. I am legally 
blind and use a guide dog for mobility purposes. I have been informed that I 
have no problems being a Muslim and having a guide dog due to my 
disability. However, I am concerned at the reaction that I get from other 
Muslims when I approach an Islamic Center. I do not want to offend but 
without the assistance of the guide dog I am unable to travel to a Masjid or 
Islamic center alone. With who should I discuss this situation i.e., an Imam? I 
sometimes feel I am at a ""stalemate"" . 
Thank you for your help.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.)
To the dear noble inquirer:
You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern 
over what you may face vis-à-vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you 
use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is 
simple and much easier to deal with than you may think.
You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or 
no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained 
guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable 
according to Islamic shari’ah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a 
dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning 
the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing.
I can’t imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the 
dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a 
religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long 
as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at 
a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not 
welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact 
the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to 
him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those 
who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response 
as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only 
goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing.
In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm 
salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I 
urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to 
you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which 
you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you 
accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) 
[translation of the meaning]:
""Verily Allaah has said, ‘If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his 
two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him 
for them Heaven.’ "" (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653)
We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and 
Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness."
276,804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/804,Uncertain of the number of breast-feedings,"Question

 
My question is about marriage. I want to marry a cousin because we are very deeply in love. But we heard that I got some milk from her mother. Then we wondered how many times this had happened. When we asked her mother, she said, ""I don’t remember - it is so long ago."" So she does not remember how many times she may have given me milk. I do not know what I should do in such a situation.
But one thing I know very well is that I love her very much! Please advise me.",,"Praise be to Allah.For breast-feeding to have the effect of making a child a relative (mahram), two conditions must be met:
(1) The number of breast-feedings should be five or more, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: ""When the Qur’an was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1452).
(2) This should happen within the first two years of the child’s life, because of the hadith: ""Harmalah ibn Yahya told us that ‘Abdullah ibn Wahb told us that Ibn Lahimah informed us from Abu al-Aswad from ‘Urwah from ‘Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be Upon Him) said: ""There is no breast-feeding except what fills the stomach to bursting point."" (Reported by Ibn Maajah, no. 1946; see also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 7495). Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: ""The chapter of the one who says there is no breast-feeding after two years because of the words of Allah ‘. . . two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling . . .’ [al-Baqarah 2:233].""
The definition of rad‘ah (one breast-feed) is that the child should take the breast and drink milk from it, then leave it of his own accord in order to breathe or to change position, and so on.
If this is the case, then the rulings concerning breast-feeding will apply, i.e. the child will be considered a relative and marriage will be forbidden, etc.
In the case of doubt concerning the number of breast-feedings, Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: ""If there is some doubt concerning whether breast-feeding took place, or concerning the number of feeds and whether it was enough to make the child a relative (mahram) or not, then there is no proof that the child must be considered a relative, because the general rule of life is that a child does not breast-feed from anyone except his own mother, and one cannot dismiss certainty in favour of doubt. (al-Mughni 11/312).
Therefore it is permissible to marry if there is no proof of breast-feeding that would make the individual concerned a relative.
I do not want to omit reminding the one who asked this question that we are obliged to adhere to the Sharee‘ah no matter where it leads us, and our desires and emotions should not prevent us from following the truth. The Muslim must remain chaste and avoid all kinds of ""love relationships."" He must strive to protect himself by marrying in a proper fashion according to Islamic sharee‘ah."

                Alslamualik
This question has bees asked several time from non-Muslims and I want 
to find an answer: Why When the Muslim convert to another 
religion(Murtad) he/she should be killed?",,"Praise be to Allah.
Your question may be answered by the following points:
(1) This is the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger, as the Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever changes his religion, kill him."" 
(reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3017).
(2) The one who has known the religion which Allaah revealed, entered it and 
practised it, then rejected it, despised it and left it, is a person who does not deserve 
to live on the earth of Allaah and eat from the provision of Allaah.
(3) By leaving Islaam, the apostate opens the way for everyone who wants to leave the 
faith, thus spreading apostasy and encouraging it.
(4) The apostate is not to be killed without warning. Even though his crime is so great, 
he is given a last chance, a respite of three days in which to repent. If he repents, he 
will be left alone; if he does not repent, then he will be killed.
(5) If the punishment for murder and espionage (also known as high treason) is death, 
then what should be the punishment for the one who disbelieves in the Lord of 
mankind and despises and rejects His religion? Is espionage or shedding blood worse 
than leaving the religion of the Lord of mankind and rejecting it?
(6) None of those who bleat about personal freedom and freedom of belief would put 
up with a neighbour’s child hitting their child or justify this as ""personal freedom,"" so 
how can they justify leaving the true religion and rejecting the sharee’ah which Allaah 
revealed to teach mankind about His unity and bring justice and fairness to all?
We ask Allaah for safety and health. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad

                Salam Brother, 
My question is; how does one purify himself or his place of business from things 
that may have occurred prior to knowledge that it was haram? For example, I own 
clothing stores, but have financed this business via moneys borrowed and paid 
interest upon. To this day I am using a bank where I have a loan and pay interest 
on it. 
Also in the past I had a business that did not succeed, and was forced into 
bankruptcy, which meant that there were many people and businesses that were 
left unpaid, what is my Islamic duty in that case? I did make a sincere effort to pay 
all that I could but after the business went bad was not able to repay them.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is wajib that you repent for each loan involving interest you took. The Prophet (peace and 
blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed all involved in the interest, the recipient, the sponsor, 
and the one eating and the feeding it, as stated in the authentic hadith. The Prophet (peace 
and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""The gold for the gold, the silver for the silver, 
wheat for wheat, barley for barley, date for date, salt for salt, similar for the like, and hand 
in hand. So whoever adds or seeks to add, then he has used riba. The recipient and the giver 
of the transaction are the same"". (Reported by Muslim, #1584.)
On the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ""cursed the one who consumes interest, the one 
giving it, the one bearing scroll, and the two witnesses to it"". He said (peace and blessings 
of Allah be upon him), ""they are all equal."" (Muslim narrated it.) 
If a Muslim wants to partake in a specific affair and he doesn't know it's ruling, then it is upon 
him to ask before he gets involved in it. Ignorance isn't an excuse for each and every situation. 
As far as the loans you borrowed, you are obligated to return the initial money borrowed only. 
If you are forced to pay riba, and that is the added amount with no way out, then we hope that 
you do your best in repenting to Allah to pardon you. We also hope that you remain consistent 
in your business and give sadaqa with what you are able to, in order to purify yourself and your 
wealth. 
We ask Allah to enrich us with His halal and to avoid His haram."

Drinking coffee is a custom and not from the laws of Islam. If drinking coffee in excess becomes 
dangerous to the individual, then Islam prohibits it. There are no ceremonies in Islam for coffee 
drinking nor is drinking coffee from the particular customs of the Muslims, since Muslims as well 
as non-Muslims drink coffee. There are however specific manners in the Islamic law concerning 
drinking in general.
From amongst them are the following: 
Drinking with the right hand.
To say Bismillah before you begin to drink.
Drinking at least three sips or more and not drinking the entire drink at once.
To praise Allah after finishing the drink. 
To drink sitting down.
The person giving the drink to others should drink last.
The person passing out the drinks should start on his right hand side when distributing the 
drinks.
An individual should not drink from the pitcher, but instead pour some of the drink into a 
dish or cup, and then drink.
A person should not drink from gold or silver dishes.
Your question dear young man and the information you provided indicates that you are without a 
religion and this is wrong because the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be 
upon him) stated that you were born as a Muslim and that this is your origin as well as others 
besides you. This is the case, until something happened to you to change that, such as other 
incorrect religions like Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, or Magianism. Return back to your true 
origin, read about Islam, and establish prayer. I see that you have sufficient wit and intelligence to 
know the truth and implement it.

Allah says: ""If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) 
witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until 
death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way."" [al-Nisa’ 4:15]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer (explanation) of this aayah:
""At the beginning of Islam, the ruling concerning a woman who was proven guilty of adultery 
was that she was to be detained in a house and not allowed to come out until she died. So the 
phrase ‘If any of your women are guilty of lewdness’ refers to adultery. ‘Take the evidence of 
four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to 
houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way’ - the ‘other way’ 
that Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with 
him, said: ‘This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was 
abrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.’ Something similar was reported from 
‘Ikrimah, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn 
Aslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: 
‘Muhammad ibn Ja‘far told us that Sa‘id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan 
ibn ‘Abdullah al-Raqaashi from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy 
(revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on 
him and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he 
said: "" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits 
adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the 
case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to 
death), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile 
for one year.""’ It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from 
al-Hasan from al-Hattan from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: 
‘Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those 
(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should 
receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male 
committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be 
stoned to death.’ Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth."" 
Al-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:
""This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam. Ibn 
‘Abbas and al-Hasan said: Ibn Zayd added: They would not be allowed to marry, until they 
died, as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else. This ruling applied for 
a while, then the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: 
""Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those 
(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should 
receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male 
committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be 
stoned to death."" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there 
with the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for 
confinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. 
To complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next 
aayah in Surat al-Nisaa’:
""If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, 
leave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful."" [al-Nisaa’ 4:16]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah:
""‘If two men among you are guilty of lewdness’ means two who commit an immoral act, so 
they should be punished. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr and 
others said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the 
ruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. ‘Ikrimah, ‘Ataa’, 
al-Hasan and ‘Abdullah ibn Katheer said: ‘This was revealed concerning a man and a woman 
who commit adultery. The phrase ‘if they repent and amend’ means if they give up what they 
were doing and mend their ways. ‘Leave them alone’ means not to keep rebuking them with 
ugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never 
sinned at all. ‘Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful’ - it was proven in the two Saheehs: ‘If the 
slave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not 
blame her (after that)’ - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been 
given, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.’"""

What do you believe about angels regarding their function, appearance, form and powers?",,"Praise be to Allah.Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief
Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of faith without which there is no faith. Whoever does not believe in any of these pillars is not a believer (mumin). These pillars are belief in: Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and that predestination, both good and bad, comes from Allah.
Who are the Angels?
Angels are a part of the world of the “Unseen” which we cannot comprehend. Allah has told us about them in many places in the Quran and via His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There follows a number of proven reports concerning the angels, which hopefully will make you realize the greatness of the Creator and the greatness of this religion which has told us so much about them:
Of what are the Angels created?
They are created from light, as ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The angels are created from light, just as the jinn are created from smokeless fire and mankind is created from what you have been told about.’"" [Muslim].
When were the Angels created?
​​​​​We have no knowledge of precisely when they were created, because there is no text to tell us this. But they were created before mankind for certain, because the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Behold, your Lord said to the angels: ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’"" [2:30] The fact that Allah told them of His intention to create man indicates that they already existed.
The great size of Angels
Allah says concerning the angels of Hell:
""O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern and severe, who flinch not (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded."" [66:6]
The greatest of all the angels is Jibreel, upon whom be peace, who was described in the following report:
""From ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Jibreel in his true form. He had six hundred wings, each of which covered the horizon. There fell from his wings jewels, pearls and rubies, only Allah knows about them."" It was reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, and Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidayah that its isnad (chain of narrators) is jayyid (good).
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing Jibreel:
""I saw Jibreel descending from heaven, and his great size filled the space between heaven and earth."" [Muslim].
Among the greatest angels are those who carry the Throne (of Allah), who were described in the following report:
""From Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: ‘I have been given permission to speak about one of the angels of Allah who carry the Throne. The distance between his ear-lobes and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.’"" [Abu Dawood].
Description of Angels
Angels have wings
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs) adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things."" [35:1]
Beauty of the Angels
Allah said, describing Jibreel, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning):
""He [the Prophet] has been taught by one Mighty in Power, Dhoo Mirrah (free from any defect in body and mind), then he rose and became stable."" [53:5-6]
Ibn ‘Abbas said: ""‘Dhoo Mirrah means that he has a beautiful appearance."" Qutadah said: ""He is tall and beautiful.""
The idea that angels are beautiful is firmly established in all people’s minds, so much so that they liken a beautiful human to an angel, as the women said about Yoosuf:
"". . . When they [the women] saw him, they did extol him and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said: ‘Allah preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none other than a noble angel!’"" [12:31]
The differences in size and status of the Angels
The Angels are not all of one size or status; there are differences between them just as there are differences in virtue. The best of them are those that were present at the battle of Badr, as is stated in the hadith narrated by Mu‘adh ibn Rifa‘ah al-Zuraqi from his father, who had been one of the people present at Badr. He said: ""Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and asked, ‘How do you rate the people among you who were present at Badr?’ He said: ‘They are the best of the Muslims,’ or something similar. [Jibreel] said: ‘So it is with the angels who were present at Badr.’"" [al-Bukhaari].
The Angels do not eat or drink
This is indicated by the conversation between Ibrahim, the ""friend"" of Allah, and the angels who visited him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf, and placed it before them. He said, ‘Will you not eat?’ (When they did not eat), he conceived a fear of them. They said: ‘Fear not,’ and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge."" [51:26-28]
Elsewhere, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""But when he [Ibrahim] saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: ‘Fear not: we have been sent against the people of Lut.’"" [11:70]
The Angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and worshipping Allah
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever slacken."" [21:20]
"". . . For in the presence of your Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never become tired (nor feel themselves above it)."" [41:38]
Number of Angels
The angels are many, and their number is known only to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Much-Frequented House (al-Bayt al-M’amoor) in the seventh heaven:
""Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them."" [al-Bukhaari].
‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Hell will be brought forth that day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand angels."" [Muslim].
Names of Angels
The angels have names, but we know only the names of a few of them. We have to believe in the names reported in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) texts, as a part of general belief in the angels. Among the names of angels that are known to us are:
(1) Jibreel and (2) Mikail
""Say: Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah’s will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings to those who believe -
Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and prophets, to Jibreel and Mikail - Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject faith."" [2:97-98]
(3) Israfil
From Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, who said: ""I asked ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to start his prayer with when he got up to pray at night (qiyam al-layl). She said: ‘When he got up to pray at night, he would start his prayer (with the words): ‘O Allah, Lord of Jibreel, Mikail and Israfil, Creator of heaven and earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You are the Judge of the matters in which Your slaves differ; guide me with regard to disputed matters of truth by Your permission, for You guide whomever You will to the straight path.’"" [Muslim].
(4) Malik
He is the Keeper of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""They [the people in Hell] will cry: ‘O Malik! Would that your Lord put an end to us!’"" [43:77]
(5) Munkar and (6) Nakeer
From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ and he says what he used to say: ‘He is the slave and Messenger of Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah. They say, ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ Then his grave will be widened for him to a size of seventy cubits by seventy cubits and it will be illuminated for him. Then they tell him, ‘Sleep.’ He says, ‘Go back to my family and tell them.’ They tell him, ‘Sleep like a bridegroom whom no-one will wake up except his most beloved,’ until Allah raises him up. If (the deceased) was a hypocrite, he says, ‘I heard the people saying something so I said something similar; I do not know.’ They say: ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ The earth will be told to squeeze him, so he will be crushed until his ribs are interlocked, and he will remain like that until Allah raises him up.’"" [al-Tirmidhi].
(7) Haroot and (8) Maroot
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
"". . . and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Haroot and Maroot . . ."" [2:102]
"". . . and none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is nothing other than a warning to mankind."" [74:31]
Power of Angels
The angels have great powers given to them by Allah, including the following:
The ability to take on different forms. Allah has given the angels the ability to take on forms other than their own. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam in the form of a man, as Allah says:
"". . . Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects."" [19:17]
Angels also came to Ibrahim in human form, and he did not know that they were angels until they told him so. Similarly, angels came to Lut in the form of young men with beautiful faces. Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) in different forms: sometimes he would appear in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a sahaabee (companion) who was very handsome, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin. The sahaabah (companions) saw him in his human form, as is reported from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the two Saheehs Al-Bukhari and Muslim). (‘Umar) said:
""One day while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of travel were to be seen on him, and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’..."" [ Muslim].
Many other ahadith (report) refer to the angels taking human forms, such as the hadith (report) about the one who killed a hundred, in which it says "". . . there came to them an angel in human form . . ."" and the hadith about the blind man, the bald man and the leper.
Speed of Angels
The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of light; the angels are able to travel much faster than this. Hardly had an enquirer completed a question to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Jibreel would bring the answer from Allah.
Duties of Angels
Among the angels is one whose task it was to convey the revelation from Allah to His Messengers; this is al-Rooh al-Ameen, Jibreel, upon whom be peace. Allah says:
""Say: whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah’s will. . . "" [2:97]
""Which the trustworthy spirit has brought down, Upon your heart, that you may be (one) of the warners."" [26:193-194]
Another is responsible for rain, directing it wherever Allah wishes. This is Mikail, upon whom be peace. He has helpers, who do what he tells them, by the command of his Lord; they direct the winds and clouds, as Allah wills.
Another is responsible for blowing the Trumpet, which will be blown by Israfil at the onset of the Hour (the Day of Judgement).
Others are responsible for taking people’s souls: these are the Angel of Death and his helpers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Say: ‘the Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls, then shall you be brought back to your Lord.’"" [32:11] There is no proof in any saheeh hadith (authentic report) that his name is ‘Azrail.
Others are responsible for protecting the slave throughout his life, when he stays home and when he travels, when he is asleep and when he is awake. These are the ""angels in succession"" concerning whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.
For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allah. Verily! Allah will not change the good condition of a people so long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sin and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allah wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector."" [13:10-11]
Others are responsible for recording the deeds of man, good and bad. These are the ""honourable scribes"" (kiraman katibeen) and are referred to in the ayat/verses (interpretation of the meanings):
"". . . and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of one’s good and bad deeds) over you . . ."" [6:61]
""Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes, We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record.""
[43:80]
""(Remember!) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being after he or she has attained the age of puberty), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions).
Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)."" [50:17-18]
""But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,
Kiraman (honourable) katibeen - writing down (your deeds)."" [82:10-11]
Others are responsible for testing people in the grave. These are Munkar and Nakeer. From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ . . ."" [The hadith is quoted in full above]
Some of them are the keepers of Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 ""And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: Salamun ‘alaikum (peace be upon you!). You have done well, so enter here, to abide therein."" [39:73]
Some of them are the keepers of Hell, the ""guards of Hell"", whose number is nineteen and whose leader is Malik, upon whom be peace. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. And its keepers will say, ‘Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?’ They will say: ‘Yes, but the word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!’"" [39:71]
""Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers), We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!"" [96:17-18]
 ""And what will make you know exactly what Hell-fire is? It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburnt)! Burning the skins! Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell). And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire, and We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers - in order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in faith . . ."" [74:27-31]
""And they will cry: ‘O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us.’ He will say: ‘Verily you shall abide forever.’"" [43:77]
One of the angels is responsible for the sperm in the womb, as is mentioned in the hadith (report) of Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose truthfulness is confirmed, said: 
‘The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in his mother’s womb for forty days as a sperm drop, and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot, and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into (the foetus), and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Hell, so he will enter Hell; and one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he will enter Paradise."" [al-Bukhaari, Muslim].
Some angels carry the Throne of Allah, as He describes in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
""Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah) (saying): ‘Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!’"" [40:7]
Some of the angels travel throughout the world, seeking out gatherings of dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: 
‘Allah, be He blessed and exalted, has angels who travel the highways seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out to one another, ""Come to what you hunger for!"" and they enfold them with their wings, stretching up to the lowest heaven. Their Lord asks them, and He knows better than them, ""What are My slaves saying?"" They say: ""They are glorifying, magnifying, praising and extolling You."" He asks, ""Have they seen Me?"" They say, ""No, by Allah, they have not seen You."" He asks, ""And how would it be if they saw Me?"" They say, ""They would be even more fervent and devoted in their praise and worship."" He asks, ""What are they asking me for?"" They say, ""They ask You for Paradise."" He asks, ""And have they seen it?"" They say, ""No, by Allah, O Lord, they have not seen it."" He asks, ""And how would it be if they saw it?"" They say: ""They would be even more eager for it and they would beseech You even more earnestly."" He asks, ""And what do they seek My protection from?"" They say, ""From the Fire of Hell."" He asks, ""Have they seen it?"" They say, ""No, by Allah, they have not seen it."" He asks, ""And how would it be if they saw it?"" They say: ""They would be even more afraid and anxious to escape it."" Allah says: ""You are My witnesses that I have forgiven them."" One of the angels says: ""So-and-so is not really one of them; he came (to the gathering) for some other reason."" Allah says, ""They were all in the gathering, and one of them will not be excluded (from forgiveness)."""" [al-Bukhaari].
Some of them are responsible for the mountains. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Have you ever faced any day more difficult than the day of Uhud?"" He said: ""I suffered at the hands of your people and the worst that I suffered was what I suffered at their hands on the day of ‘Aqabah. That was when I went to call Ibn ‘Abd Yalayl ibn ‘Abd al-Kalal to Islam, and he did not respond. I left, feeling depressed and hardly knowing where I was going. I did not recover until I found myself in Qarn al-Tha‘alib. I raised my head and saw that I was being shaded by a cloud. I looked, and saw Jibreel in the cloud. He called me and said: ‘Allah has heard what your people said and how they responded to you. He has sent the Angel of the Mountains so that you can tell him to do to them whatever you want.’ The Angel of the Mountains called me and greeted me, then said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me what you want me to do. If you want, I can crush them between two mountains. ’""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""All I hope for is that Allah will bring forth from their loins people who will worship Allah alone and not associate any partner with Him."" [al-Buhaari].
Some of them visit the Much Frequented House (al-bayt al-m’amoor). In the lengthy hadith describing the Isra and M’iraj (the Night Journey and the Ascent to Heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
""Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.""
There are also angels standing in rows, who never get tired or sit down, and others who bow or prostrate, and never raise their heads, as was reported by Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. The heaven makes a noise like groaning, and it has the right to (or it is no surprise), for there is no space in it the width of four fingers, but there is an angel there, placing his forehead in sujood (prostration) to Allah. By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much, you would not enjoy your relationships with women and you would go out in the street praying to Allah.’"" [ al-Tirmidhi]
This is a summary of Islamic teachings concerning the noble angels of Allah. We ask Allah to make us believe in them and love them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

288,844,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/844,Ruling on operations to repair the hymen,"Question

                For some reason a woman tore her hymen. Is it permissible for her to have it repaired surgically?",,"Praise be to Allah.
This matter is one of the issues that
      have been raised in the modern age, so we should look at each of the two
      scholarly opinions on the matter and indicate which one we believe to be
      more correct.
      
       The first opinion is that it is not
      permissible to repair the hymen at all.
 The second opinion is more detailed:
1.If the rupture of the hymen was caused by an accident
      or by an action that is not considered in sharee’ah to be a sin, and was
      not caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, then we
      look at the following issue:
If
      it is deemed most likely that the girl will suffer hardship and unfair
      accusations because of the customs and traditions of her society, then
      doing this operation is obligatory. If that is not the case, then it is
      still better to do the operation.
2.If the rupture was caused by intercourse within the
      bounds of legal marriage, as in the case of woman who has been divorced,
      or by zinaa (illicit sexual activity i.e., outside the bounds of marriage)
      in a case that is well known among the people, then it is haraam to do
      this operation.
3.If the rupture was caused by zinaa in a case that is
      not well known among the people, then the doctor has the choice of either
      repairing it or not repairing it, although it is better to repair it.
The points on which the scholars differ
 The differences between these two
      opinions are confined to the first and third cases outlined above. With
      regard to the second case, they are agreed that this operation in haraam
      in such situations.
 Evidence (daleel)
The evidence for the first view (that it is
      completely haraam).
 Firstly: repairing the hymen could lead
      to mixing of lineages, as a woman could become pregnant from a previous
      liaison, then she gets marriaed after having her hymen repaired, which
      then leads to the pregnancy being attributed to her husband, thus mixing
      halaal with haraam.
 Secondly: repairing the hymen involves
      looking at that part of the ‘awrah which is to hidden most.
 Thirdly: repairing the hymen makes
      iteasy for young women to commit the sin of zinaa, because they know that
      they can have the hymen repaired afterwards. 
Fourthly: there is the matter of good and bad
      consequences, or pros and cons. If it is possible to achieve the good
      consequences whilst warding off the bad consequences, then we should do
      that. If the bad consequences outweigh the good consequences, we should
      ward off the bad consequences and not worry about the good consequences,
      as the fuqahaa’ of Islam have stated. 
If we apply this principle and look at the
      evil consequences that result from repairing the hymen, we will understand
      that it is not permissible to do this operation because of the enormity of
      the evil consequences that result from it. 
Fifthly: one of the principles of Islamic
      sharee’ah is that something harmful cannot be removed by something else
      that is also harmful. One of the implications of this principle is that
      “it is not permissible for a man to prevent his land from being flooded
      by diverting the flood waters onto someone else’s land.” By the same
      token, it is not permissible for a girl and her mother to remove harm from
      themselves by having the hymen repaired and thus causing harm to the
      husband. 
Sixthly: the basic idea of repairing the hymen
      is not permissible according to sharee’ah because it is a kind of
      deceit, and deceit is forbidden in Islam. 
Seventhly: repairing the hymen pavest he way
      for girls and their families to tell lies about the real reason why the
      hymen was ruptured, and lying is also forbidden in Islam. 
Eighthly: repairing the hymen paves the way
      for doctors to resort to performing abortions for the purposes of
      concealing sin. 
Evidence for the second opinion: 
Firstly: the texts indicate that it is
      permissible and is encouraged to conceal sins, and repairing the hymen
      helps to achieve that in cases where this operation is permissible. 
Secondly: if a woman who is innocent of any
      immoral action is allowed to have this operation so as to leave no room
      for suspicion, this will ward off unjustice for her and will achieve the
      aim prescribed by sharee’ah of thinking well of believing men and women. 
Thirdly: repairing the hymen has to ward off
      harm . If a woman was left without having this operation done, and her
      husband were to notice that, it would cause trouble for her and her
      family, and if the matter became well known among people, the family may
      never be able to find marriage partners for their daughters. So they are
      permitted to ward off harm because they are innocent in this case.
 Fourthly: the fact that a Muslim doctor
      may perform this operation in order to conceal the illusionary evidence of
      has a general educational impact on society, especially where the
      psychology of young women is concerned. 
Fifthly: the objection of deception does not
      exist in cases where we have determined that it is permissible to repair
      the hymen. 
Which view is more correct? 
The view which is more correct- and Allaah knows best – is that which states that it is not
      permissible to repair the hymen at all. This is for the following reasons: 
Fisrtly: because the reports quoted as
      evidence by those who have this view are saheeh. 
Secondly: with regard to the evidence quoted
      by those who favour the second view, they may be dealt with as follows: 
The response to the first :
The concealing that is required in Islam is
      that described in the texts as a concealing of sin, but this aim is not
      achieved by repairing the hymen. Basically it is haraam because it
      involves uncovering the ‘awrah and opens the door to evil. 
The response to the second :
Preventing the husband from thinking badly of
      the woman may be achieved by informing him of the situation before
      marriage. If he accepts it, this is fine, otherwise Allaah will compensate
      her with someone better. 
The response to the third :
The evil consequence mentioned cannot be
      avoided entirely by doing this operation, because there is the possibility
      that the husband may find out about it, even if that happens by way of
      someone else telling him. He should be told about it, and if he accepts
      then the evil consequence is not longer an issue, as is also the case if
      he decides not to go ahead with the marriage. 
The response to the fourth :
Even though there are some positive aspects to
      this concealment, there are also negative consequences, such as making it
      easy for women to commit zinaa. Warding off evil consequences takes
      priority over gaining benefits. 
The response to the fifth :
We do not accept that there is no deception
      involved, because this hymen is renewed, it is not the original hymen. If
      we accept that there is no deception of the husband involved in cases
      where the hymen was broken as a result of jumping and so on, we cannot be
      sure that there is no deception in cases where it was broken as a result
      of an attack on the woman. 
Secondly: blocking the routes that could lead
      to harm, as mentioned by those who favour the first opinion, is a very
      important matter, especially in cases that have to do with the violation
      of the sanctity of private parts and the evil that can undoubtedly result
      from permitting the repair of hymens. 
Thirdly: the basic principle in Islam is that
      it is haraam to uncover, touch or look at that which is ‘awrah. The
      excuses mentioned by those who favour the second opinion are not strong
      enough to let operations to repair the hymen be exempted from this general
      rule. So we have to adhere to this ruling, and say that it is haraam to do
      operations to repair the hymen. 
Fifthly [sic]: the evil consequence of false
      accusations being made can be dealt with by obtaining a medical
      certificate after the event to prove the woman’s innocence. This is the
      best way, and by doing this there is no longer any need to do an operation
      to repair the hymen. 
 For all of these reasons, it is not
      permissible for a doctor or a woman to do this kind of surgery, and Allaah
      knows best.
 (See Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah
      wa’l-Athaar al-Mutarattibah ‘alayhaa  by Dr. Muhammad ibn
      Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti, p. 403)
Some contemporary scholars have issued fatwas
      stating that surgery to repair the hymen is permissible in the case of
      rape victims and those who have repented (from zinaa), but it not
      permissible in the case of women who have not repented, because this is

      who has previously had intercourse is not permitted to do this operation
      because this is helping her to deceive and cheat a future husband, since

I am a 21yr-old young man and inshallah next year I will be getting married.
My question is that, i need to know the way a marriage is set to be planned. I mean how is the nikah supposed to be performed, how many people can i invite? Is there a limit? Can I have music, dancing during my wedding or during reception or walima?
Also I need to know whose responsibility is it to conduct the nikah and walima? Is it the brides, or the bride grooms?
I need to know the answer a.s.a.p. so I could inform my family and inshallah I will implement it in my life, so Allah will bless me and my marriage.",How to consummate marriage: 1: you should treat your bride kindly and gently; 2- you should place your hand on your bride’s head and pray for her; 3- you should pray two rak’ahs with her; and 4- you should say the du’a reported by Ibn 'Abbas.,"Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam
When a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage , a number of things are recommended in the sunnah:

He should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: “I prepared ‘Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: ‘Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, ‘Give some to your companion (meaning himself).’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani)

He should place his hand on his bride’s head and pray for her, saying “Bismillah” and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi wa a’udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).’” Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa’id added: “Then let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.” (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami’ al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami’, no. 341)

He should pray two rak’ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa’id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: “When your wife comes in to you, pray two rak’ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.” (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: “A man called Abu Hariz came and said (to ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud, may Allah be pleased with him): ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ ‘Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak’ahs behind you.’” (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani).
When he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)’ – then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91)

Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast?
There is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride’s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite.
Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram?
It is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? 
At weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present.
Who should give the wedding walimah?
Providing the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband’s responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, “Give a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048).
We ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage.
And Allah knows best."

                I am very interested in learning more about and embracing the religion of Al-Islam. My problem is that I live in an area that has no Muslim community at all. No places of worship, no study groups, nothing. What is the best way for me to get started learning what I should know?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al hamdulilah
As soon as you have come to know, dear noble inquirer, that Islam is the true religion of righteousness and the straight path, you should hasten to embrace it and begin practicing the Islamically-prescribed obligations, such as the prayer, etc. Your earning to learn about Islam is a wonderful thing for which you should be commended.
Your unfortunate complaint regarding the absence of a helpful surrounding and a righteous environment is certainly a valid one and to a degree a problem; however, this obstacle no doubt can be overcome by the will of Allaah. For example there are several pages on the Internet that you can use to gain knowledge and benefit. You can also correspond to the various Islamic organizations and publishing houses to get valuable and informative books about Islam. There may be an Islamic center in your town or in a nearby town that you can go to, even if only once a month, to get to know your fellow Muslim sisters and to get advice from them and work with each other in enjoining righteousness and good deeds. Perhaps you can use the internet as an avenue to find out the addresses of Islamic centers in any particular city or state.
If it is possible for you to move to a city where there is a Muslim community or an Islamic center which adheres to true, mainstream Islam (followers of the Sunnah and the united Islamic community), this would be very good. If, in the worst case, may Allaah forbid, lets suppose you don't find even a single Muslim about you, this would not ever prevent you from holding fast to the religion of Islam. In Islam you have an ever-persistent relationship with your Lord; you worship Him and talk to Him and ask Him
guidance, support, and aid in adhering to His religion; you feel His company and security by your prayers to Him your seeking refuge in Him--to an extent that will compensate you more than the absence of anybody else, and will allay your loneliness and the inability to meet fellow sisters in faith and religion. Consider the situation of the followers of our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) who embraced Islam at its inception. They remained alone and estranged among their tribes and people, each one worshipping Allaah from his place until the Prophet migrated to al-Madinah, at which time they migrated with him and supported him in establishing the Islamic state.
We ask Allaah for your guidance and for you to reply quickly to the call of Allaah and his Prophet (peace be upon him), and we wish you happiness in this life and the hereafter."

292,864,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/864,"Bid'ah Hasanah (""Good Innovations"")","Question

I have a question in the area of what is and isn't Bidaa. Over and over again I hear people terming certain actions as Bidaa. I am however confused. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there a hadith by Prophet Muhammed that says that anyone who introduces a new helpful hadith will be rewarded. If this is true, then why are all new inovations frowned upon.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we should know what ""bid'ah"" means according to Islamic teaching.
It is defined as: any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allah. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Quran or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator].
 
If your confusion has to do with an apparent contradiction between the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah and the hadith narrated by Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, then let us examine these two reports and find out what they mean:
 
Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah al-Bajali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing and is followed by others, will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in any way. Whoever starts a bad thing and is followed by others, will bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their burden in any way.'"" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2675. He said, This is a saheeh hasan hadith)
 
There is a story behind this hadith, which will explain what ""whoever starts a good thing"" means. Imaam Muslim reported this story from Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, who also narrated the hadith itself. He said: ""Some people from the Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), wearing woollen garments. He saw that they were in bad shape and in desperate need, so he urged the people to give them charity. They people were very slow to respond, and it could be seen in his face (that he was upset). Then a man of the Ansaar brought a package of silver, then another came, and another and another, and his face was filled with joy. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts a bad thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a burden of sin like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden.'"" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1017)
 
Further explanation may be found in a report recorded by al-Nisaa'i, also from Jareer ibn 'Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) early one day, when some people who were almost naked (not dressed properly) and barefoot, with their swords by their sides, came to him. Most, if not all of them, were of (the tribe of) Mudar. The Messenger's face changed when he saw how poor they were (i.e., he became upset). He went into (his house), then he came out and ordered Bilaal to give the call to prayer. He led the people in prayer, then he addressed them, saying: 'O people, ""be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both he created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)"" [al-Nisaa' 4:1].
""Fear Allah, and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow"" [al-Hashr 59:18].
Let a man give charity from his dinars, his dirhams, his clothing, his wheat or his dates - even if it is only half a date.' A man from the Ansaar brought a package which he could hardly carry in his hand, then another and another came, until there were two piles, of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) beaming with joy. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward, and whoever starts a bad thing in Islam will have to bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Mujtaba: Kitaab al-Zakaat, Bab al-Tahreed 'ala al-Sadaqah).
From the context of the story, it is clear that what is meant by the words ""whoever starts a good thing (sunnah hasanah) in Islam"" means: Whoever revives a part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or teaches it to others, or commands others to follow it, or acts according to it so that others see him or hear about it and follow his example. This is also indicated by the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he urged the people to give him charity. A man said: 'I have such-and-such,' and there was no person left in the gathering who did not give something in charity to him, whether it was a large amount or a little. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts something good, and others follow his lead, will have a complete reward and a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts something bad, and others follow his lead, will bear a complete burden of sin, and a burden like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by Ibn Maaajah in al-Sunan, no. 204)
It should be clear from the above, with no room for doubt, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not allowing innovation in matters of deen (religion), nor was he opening the door to what some people call ""bid'ah hasanah,"" for the following reasons:


The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated repeatedly that: ""Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire."" (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah.
 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, when beginning a khutbah (sermon): "" The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going astray"" (reported by Muslim, no. 867)
 
If every bid'ah is a going astray, how can some people then say that there is such a thing in Islam as ""bid'ah hasanah""? By Allah, this is an obvious contradiction of the statement and warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).


The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that whoever innovates something new in the deen (religion) will have his deed rejected, and Allah will not accept it, as is stated in the hadith narrated by 'Aa'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not a part of it will have it rejected.'"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, no. 2697). How can anybody then say that bid'ah is acceptable and it is permitted to follow it?
 

When a person innovates something and adds to the deen something that does not belong to it, he is implying a number of bad things, each worse than the last, for example:


That the religion is lacking, that Allah did not complete and perfect it, and that there is room for improvement. This clearly contradicts the statement in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): "" This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion"" [al-Maa'idah 5:3]
That the religion remained imperfect from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the time when this innovator came along and completed it with his own ideas.
That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ""guilty"" of either of two things: either he was ignorant of this ""good innovation,"" or he knew about it but concealed it, thus letting his ummah down by not conveying it.
That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his Companions and the righteous salaf (early generations) missed out on the reward of this ""good innovation"" - until this innovator came along and earned it for himself, despite the fact that he should say to himself, ""If it was truly good, they would have been the first to do it.""
Opening the door to bid'ah leads to changing the deen (religion) and opens the way for personal whims and opinions, because every innovator implies that what he is introducing is something good, so whose opinion are we supposed to follow, and which of them should we take as a leader?
Following bid'ah leads to the cancelling out of sunnah practices and the ways of the salaf. Real life bears witness that whenever a bid'ah is followed, a sunnah practice dies out; the reverse is also true.

We ask Allah to save us from the misguidance of personal whims and from all trials whether they are open or secret. And Allah knows best."

What i want to know is that: What kind of people will be included into the ""shade"" of the chair which Allah (s.w.t) will be sitting, when the sun is brought closer to the earth. I hope i am phrasing the question right.",,"Praise be to Allah.Seven of those whom Allah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His were mentioned in the saheeh ahadith.
 It was reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
 “There are seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up.” (Agreed upon, narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 620; Muslim, no. 1712; and others).
 This is one of the blessings that Allah bestows upon His believing slaves. On the great Day when mankind will be suffering distress and hardship,the sun will be brought near to mankind, until the distance between them is equal to the length of the stick used for applying kohl to the eyes [meel= may also mean a “mile”], and all the people will sweat according to their deeds, except for some of the believers, whom Allah will single out to shade them with His shade, and He will protect them from the sun and from sweating.
 ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say:
 “The sun will be brought near to the earth and the people will sweat. For some people, the sweat will come up to their heels; for some it will come halfway up their shins; for some it will come up to their knees; for some it will come up to their backsides; for some it will come up to their hips; for some it will come up to their shoulders; for some it will come up to their necks; for some it will come up to the middle of their mouths; and some of them will be comepletely covered with their sweat.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, no. 16798)
 There follows the commentary of Ibn Hajar (may Allah be pleased with him) on the hadith (about the shade of Allah):
 “with His shade”. The fact that the shade is connected to Allah is an expression of honour, for every shade belongs to Him. It was said that this refers to His honour and protection, just as it may be said (in Arabic) that a person is in the shade (or shadow) of the king. And it was said that it refers to the shadow of His Throne, which is more correct
 “the just ruler” means one who holds the position of khaleefah, and anyone else who is appointed to a position of authority over the Muslims’ affairs, and he fulfils his duties justly.
 The best definition of “just” is: one who obeys the commands of Allah and puts everything in its proper place without going to the extreme either of overdoing it or of negligence. The just ruler is mentioned first because his benefits are so far-reaching.
 “a young man”. Young men are mentioned in particular because they are more likely to feel desire because of their strong motives for following their desires. The fact that a young man adheres to worship despite that is indicative of the strength of his taqwaa (piety).
 “worshipping his Lord”. In the hadith of Salmaan it says that he “spent his youth and his energy in worshipping Allah.”
 “attached to the mosque”. The apparent meaning is attachment in the sense of hanging, as if his heart is likened to something that hangs in the mosque – like a lamp, for example – indicating that his heart is so strongly attached to the mosque that even when he leaves the mosque, his heart is still there. Or it could mean attachment in the sense of a deep love.
 “love one another” means, they shared a kind of love whereby each loved the other in a genuine sense, not just to show off.
 “and [they] meet and part on that basis” means, this is an ongoing love based on religion, which they do not cut off for any worldly reason, whether they meet in reality or not, until death comes between them.
 “a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty”. The meaning of “of rank” is, of high birth or a high position; this may refer to lineage or to wealth. The woman is described as having all the qualities which people usually seek, power and wealth, along with beauty. It is very rare to find all three in a woman. The apparent meaning is that she called him to commit immoral actions.
 “and says ‘I fear Allah’”. The apparent meaning is that he says this out loud, either to rebuke her for her immoralityor to refuse her call. It may also be that he says it in his heart.
 “to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives”. What is meant by this is that he conceals his charitable giving , and goes to such an extreme that his left hand, even though it is so close to his right hand and is always with it that even if we imagined that it could understand, it would not know what the right hand is doing because of this utter secrecy. This is a metaphor.
 “and a man who remembers Allah” – either in his heart, or by mentioning Him out loud.
 “when he is alone” – because this is furthest away from showing off. What is meant here is that there are no distractions, so he pays attention to nothing except Allah.
 “his eyes fill up (lit. flood)” means, they fill with tears; this is another metaphor.
 Although men are mentioned in this hadith, women are also included in what is described here. Although what is meant by a “just leader” is the position of imaam (khaleefah), women may also be included in this, if they have children and treat them justly. The idea of being attached to the mosque does not apply to women, because a woman’s prayer in her home is better than her prayer in the mosque. Apart from that, women have a share in all of these things; if a man may be called by a woman, then it can be imagined that a woman could be called by a handsome king, for example, and she refuses because she fears Allah, even though she may have motives to respond.
 Fath al-Baari, 620.

I want to know the Islamic view on wearing colored contact lenses.","If a woman wears coloured cosmetic contact lenses for her husband, there is nothing wrong with it. But if she is wearing coloured contact lenses where others will see her, then this should not cause any fitnah or temptation. Also, there is nothing wrong with wearing ophthalmic contact lenses on the advice of specialists","Praise be to Allah.There are two types of contact lenses:

Ophthalmic contact lenses: those that are used to correct long- or short-sightedness etc. There is nothing wrong with using this kind of contact lens on the advice of a specialist eye-doctor.
Coloured cosmetic contact lenses: these come under the rulings on adornment. If a woman wears them for her husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If she is wearing them where others will see her too, then it should not cause any fitnah or temptation. There is also the condition that they should not cause any harm, and there should be no element of cheating or deceiving, such as a woman wearing them when she meets the man who is proposing marriage to her. Also, they should not be extravagantly expensive, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and waste not by extravagance…” [Al-An'am 6:141]

299,930,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/930,The Man is Head of Household,"Question

                IF THE MAN IS NOT THE MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IS HE CONSIDERED AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD?",,"Praise be to Allah.Qiwaamah (the role of being in charge or head of the household) is one of the things that Allaah has given to men, exclusive of women. What is meant by qiwaamah is that men are entrusted with the task of being responsible for women, to take care of them, to guide them in the best possible way, and to issue commands and prohibitions - just as a ruler takes care of the people under his control.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""...but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [women]..."" [al-Baqarah 2:228] and ""Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means..."" [al-Nisaa’ 4:34]
Ibn Katheer said: ""This means that men are in charge of women; they govern them and discipline them if they do wrong."" Al-‘Allaamah Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said: ""This indicates that men are better than women, because the masculine is honour and perfection, whereas the feminine naturally has something lacking physically. All people are agreed on this, because all peoples give women the best of adornments, which is only to make up for this natural lack...""
Rare cases among women are nothing to go by, because the exception does not change the rule.
Some of the reasons why men are given the role of qiwaamah include:
1. Men are more intelligent and have a better ability to distinguish right from wrong. Al-Qurtubi said: ""Men have the advantage of being more wise and more capable of management; for this reason they were given the right of qiwaamah."" 2. Men’s religion is more complete, because women menstruate and bleed after childbirth, and do not pray or fast at such times - unlike men. 3. Spending money in charity and on one’s family is a duty on men, but not on women.
Thus if a man refuses to spend on his wife, she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage by going to a Qaadi (Sharee’ah judge).
In summary, qiwaamah is only for men, as is made clear in the Qur’aan. If a woman spends on her husband, herself and her children, this is an act of kindness on her part, as Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): ""... but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it (the mahr) to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)."" [al-Nisaa’ 4:4] Qiwaamah is for men in all cases: one can hardly imagine a man asking his wife for permission to go out, for example. And Allaah knows best.
For more information on this matter, please refer to: Ibn al-‘Arabi, Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 1/531; Ahkaam al-Jassaas, 2/188; Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 2/169; Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/491; al-Shanqeeti, Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 1/136-137)"

What is the ruling of the Ulama with chicken slaughtered by Muslims but were stunned (given mild electric shock to weaken the chicken) before slaughtering?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is prohibited to stun the animals by stroking or using electricity for these kinds of stunning hurt the animal and the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) interdicts us from torturing or hurting animals and on the contrary ordered us to be kind and benevolent with them especially at slaughtering. Imam Ahmad narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) passed by a group from Al-Ansar (the supporters) while they were aiming at a pigeon. The Prophet said: ""Don’t make an aim from an alive creature"".
Saeed Ibn-Gobair narrated that Ibn-Ommar had passed by some youth from Koraish while they were aiming at a bird and in return for their missed shoots they gave the owner of the bird the arrows. When the youth saw Ibn-Ommar, they ran away so Ibn-Ommar said: ""Who did that? Allah curses the one who did that. The prophet (Peace be upon Him) curses any one who takes an alive creature as an aim"".Narrated by Muslim # 3619
Imam Muslim narrated on the authority of Ibn-Gaber Ibn-Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Prophet ""forbids us from leaving animals tied without food or drinks until death"" (No. 3620)
Also, Imam Muslim narrated that Shadad Ibn-Aws said: ""I have kept in heart two points from our Prophet (Peace be upon Him). Allah orders us to refine every thing we do. When killing enemies, kill properly, and when slaughtering animals slaughter properly. So the one in change of slaughtering must sharpen his blade to comfort his slaughtered animal.
There are many other evidences that prove the importance of being kind and benevolent with animals.
In short, it is unlawful to stun the animal before slaughtering because stunning hurts the animal and Allah forbids us from doing that except in necessary when the animal is out of control at slaughtering and it is difficult to catch it so it is then lawful to resort to partial stunning to control the animal and in turn it would be lawful to be eaten if it is slaughtered alive.
This stunning is permitted only if it doesn’t lead to death of the animal for if that happened it would be unlawful to be eaten as Allah the Almighty said in His Holy Book:
""Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah, that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a head long fall, or by being gored to death, that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal, unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due from), that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrow: that is impiety.""

301,947,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/947,Greeting Non-Muslims on Their Festivals,"Question

Can a Muslim greet a non-Muslim on his festival holiday like Christmas or Thanksgiving?","Greeting the non-Muslims on Christmas and other religious holidays like Thanksgiving is prohibited by consensus because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of disbelief, even if one would not accept those things for oneself.","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Greeting the non-Muslims on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is prohibited by consensus.
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam Ahl Adh-Dhimmah: 
""Congratulating the non-Muslims on the rituals that belong only to them is prohibited by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying ‘A happy festival to you’ or ‘May you enjoy your festival ,’ and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from [falling into] disbelief, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. 
It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realise the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or Bbid`ah or disbelief exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allah.""
Congratulating the non-Muslims on their religious festivals is prohibited to the extent described by Ibn Al-Qayyim  (may Allah have mercy on him) because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of disbelief, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not accept the rituals of disbelief or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
""If you disbelieve, then verily, Allah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. . ."" [Az-Zumar 39:7]
"". . . This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion . . ."" [Al-Ma’idah 5:3]
So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are one’s colleagues at work or otherwise.
If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allah. 
These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islam, with which Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" [Al `Imran 3:85]
It is prohibited for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations .
Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the non-Muslims by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts , or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever imitates a people is one of them.""
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Iqtida’ As-Siraat Al-Mustaqim Mukhalifat ashab Al-jahim: 
""Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak [Muslims].""
Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islam, and because it makes the non-Muslims feel proud of their religion.
Allah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 3/369)

302,949,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/949,Will the Love of Allah Save You from Punishment?,"Question

Will a person who loves Allah enter Hell? There are many non-Muslims such as Jews and Christians who love Allah, and similarly there are immoral Muslims who love Allah. They would never say that they hate their Lord. Can you clarify this matter?","Loving Allah alone is insufficient to earn Allah's reward and for salvation. Loving what Allah loves is a means to enter Islam and leave disbelief, and those most devoted to this love are most beloved to Allah. Love for the sake of Allah is essential and interconnected with loving what Allah loves. Loving that which Allah loves cannot be complete until one also loves for the sake of Allah.","Praise be to Allah.Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding this matter:
“There are four kinds of love , which we must differentiate between, and those who go astray do so because they do not make this distinction. 

The first of them is loving of Allah, but this alone is not sufficient to save a person from the punishment of Allah or to earn His reward. The Mushrikun (polytheists), worshippers of the cross, Jews and others all love Allah. 
The second is loving that which Allah loves. This is what brings a person into Islam and out of disbelief. The most beloved of people to Allah are those who are most correct and most devoted in this kind of love. 
The third kind is loving for the sake of Allah , which is one of the essential components of loving that which Allah loves. Loving that which Allah loves cannot be complete until one also loves for the sake of Allah . 
The fourth is loving something alongside Allah, and this  is polytheistic love. Whoever loves something along with Allah, not for His sake or through His love or for it, has taken another as an equal with Him. This is the love of the polytheists. 

There remains a fifth kind of love which has nothing to do with our topic; this is the natural love which is a person’s inclination towards that which suits his nature, such as the love of a thirsty person for water or of a hungry person for food, or the love of sleep, or of one’s wife and children. There is nothing wrong with this unless it distracts a person from remembering Allah and keeps him from loving Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah.” [Al-Munafiqun 63:9]
“Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah.” [An-Nur 24:37]” (Al-Jawab al-Kafi, 1/134)
Ibn Al-Qayyim ( may Allah have mercy on him) also said :
“The difference between loving for the sake of Allah and loving something alongside Allah is one of the most important distinctions. Everyone needs to make this distinction and is indeed obliged to do so. Loving for the sake of Allah is a sign of the perfection of faith, but loving something alongside Allah is the essence of shirk (polytheism). 
The difference between them is that a person’s love for the sake of Allah is connected to his love of Allah; if this love becomes strong in his heart, this love dictates that he will love that which Allah loves. If he loves that which his Lord loves and he loves those who are the friends of Allah, this is love for the sake of Allah. So he loves His Messengers, Prophets, angels and close friends because Allah loves them, and he hates those who hate them because Allah hates those people. 
The sign of the love and hatred for the sake of Allah is that his hatred for the one whom Allah hates will not turn into love merely because that person treats him kindly, does him a service or meets some need he has; and his love for those whom Allah loves will not turn to hatred simply because that person does something that upsets or hurts him, whether it is done by mistake or deliberately, in obedience to Allah or because the person feels that he has a duty to do it for some reason, or because the person is a wrongdoer who may yet give up his wrongdoing and repent. 
The entire religion revolves around four principles: love and hatred, and stemming from them, action and abstinence. The person whose love and hatred, action and abstinence, are all for the sake of Allah, has perfected his faith so that when he loves, he loves for the sake of Allah, when he hates, he hates for the sake of Allah, when he does something, he does it for the sake of Allah, and when he abstains from something, he abstains for the sake of Allah. To the extent that he is lacking in these four categories, he is lacking in faith and commitment to religion. This is in contrast to the love of things alongside Allah, which is of two types. One is diametrically opposed to the principle of Tawhid (Oneness of Allah) and is shirk; the other is opposed to perfection of sincerity and love towards Allah, but does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam.

The first kind is like the love of the Mushrikun for their idols and gods. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah.” [Al-Baqarah 2:165]
These Mushrikun love their idols and gods alongside Allah as they love Allah. This love and devotion is accompanied by fear, hope, worship and supplication. This love is pure Shirk which Allah does not forgive. Faith cannot be perfected unless a person regards these idols as enemies and hates them intensely, and hates the people who worship them, and regards them as enemies and strives against them. This is the message with which Allah sent all His messengers and revealed all His Books. He created Hell for the people of shirk who love these rivals, and He created Paradise for those who strive against them and take them as enemies for His sake and to earn His Pleasure. Anybody who worships anything from the vicinity of the Throne to the lowest depths of the earth and takes a god and a supporter besides Allah and associates other beings in worship with Him, will be disowned by the object of his worship when he is most in need of it [i.e., on the Day of Judgement].

The second kind is love for the things which Allah has made attractive to people, such as women, children, gold, silver, branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. People love them with a kind of desire, like the love of the hungry person for food and the thirsty person for water. This love is of three kinds. If a person loves them for the sake of Allah and as a means of obeying Allah , he will be rewarded for that; it will be counted as a part of love for the sake of Allah and a means of reaching Him, and he will still find enjoyment in them. 

This is how the best of creation [i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] was, to whom women and perfume were made dear in this world, and his love for them helped him to love Allah more and to convey His Message and fulfill His commands. 
If a person loves them because they suit his nature and his own desires, but he does not give them preference over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and he gets them because of his natural inclination, then they come under the heading of things which are permissible, and he will not be punished for that, but his love of Allah and for the sake of Allah will be lacking somewhat. If his sole purpose in life is to get these things, and he gives priority to that over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, then he is wronging himself and following his own desires.
The first is the love of al-Sabiqun (those who are foremost in Islam); the second is the love of al-muqtasidun (those who are average) and the third is the love of al-zalimun (the wrongdoers).” (Al-Ruh by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/254)

303,951,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/951,What Is ‘Aqeedah?,"Question

What is ‘Aqeedah? I kindly request you to explain this to me.","‘Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one’s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty.","Praise be to Allah.What is ‘Aqeedah?
‘Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one’s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty.
The Arabic word ‘aqeedah stems from the root ‘aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bima ‘aqqadtum al-ayman)…"" [al-Maidah 5:89]
The verb paraphrased here as ""deliberate oaths"" is ‘aqqada/ta’qeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, ‘aqada’l-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. 
The word i’tiqad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong. The phrase a’taqadtu kadhaa (I believe such and such) means: I am convinced of it in my heart; this is a rational conviction.
In Islam, ‘aqeedah is the matter of knowledge. The Muslim must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts or misgivings, because Allah has told him about ‘aqeedah in His Book and via His Revelations to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Principles of ‘Aqeedah
The principles of ‘aqeedah are those which Allah has commanded us to believe in, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
""The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers’ – and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’"" [al-Baqarah 2:285]
- and as defined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous hadeeth which describes how Jibreel came to him and asked him about Islam etc.: ""Iman (faith) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him on the Last Day, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection.""
So in Islam, ‘aqeedah refers to the matters which are known from the Quran and sound ahadeeth, and which the Muslim must believe in his heart, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allaah and His Messenger.

                Could you please answer my question about Shee‘ah (Shi‘a) Islam? Is it 
permissible for one to think badly of the Prophet’s wife ‘Aa’ishah, when anything 
said about ‘Aa’ishah is from authentic hadeeeths, such as Saheeh al-Bukhaari and 
Saheeh Muslim?",,"Praise be to Allah.
‘Aa’ishah and the other Mothers of the Believers are included among the Companions of the 
Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), so every text that forbids slandering the Companions 
refers to ‘Aa’ishah too.
Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘Do not slander my Companions, for if one of you were to spend an 
amount of gold equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud, you would not even come halfway up to 
their level."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3379).
Moreover, the scholars of Sunni Islam are all agreed that whoever condemns ‘Aa’ishah for that 
of which Allaah has stated she is innocent is a kaafir, because he has rejected Allaah’s 
statement of her innocence in Soorat al-Noor.
Imaam Ibn Hazm quoted a report with an isnad going back to Hishaam ibn ‘Ammaar, who said: 
""I heard Maalik ibn Anas say: ‘Whoever curses Abu Bakr should be whipped, and whoever 
curses ‘Aa’ishah should be killed.’ He was asked, ‘Why do you say that concerning (the one 
who curses) ‘Aa’ishah?’ He said, ‘Because Allaah says concerning ‘Aa’ishah, may Allah be 
pleased with her (interpretation of the meaning): ""Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and 
warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers."" [al-Noor 24:17]’""
Maalik said: ""Whoever accuses her goes against the Qur’aan, and whoever goes against the 
Qur’aan should be killed.""
Ibn Hazm said: ""This comment of Maalik’s is correct, and it is complete apostasy to reject 
Allaah’s words that clearly state her innocence.""
Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: ""Because the people who slandered ‘Aa’ishah accused a pure and 
innocent person of immorality, then Allah exonerated her. So everyone who accuses her of that 
of which Allah has stated she is innocent is rejecting what Allah says, and everyone who rejects 
what Allah says is a kaafir. This is the opinion of Maalik, and the matter is very clear to those 
who have insight.""
Al-Qaadi Abu Ya‘laa said: ""Whoever slanders ‘Aa’ishah by accusing her of that of which Allah 
stated her innocence is a kaafir, without doubt. More than one imam stated this ijmaa‘ 
(consensus) and gave this ruling.""
Ibn Abi Moosaa said: ""Whoever accuses ‘Aa’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, of that of 
which Allaah stated she was innocent has left the religion (is no longer a Muslim) and has no 
right to marry a Muslim woman."" 
Ibn Qudaamah said: ""It is a part of the Sunnah to say ‘May Allah be pleased with her’ after 
mentioning the wives of the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), Mothers of the Believers 
who are pure and innocent of any evil. The best of them are Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid and 
‘Aa’ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, whose innocence was stated by Allah; (they are) the 
wives of the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) in this world and the next. Whoever accuses 
her of that of which Allah has stated her innocence has rejected the words of Allaah 
All-Mighty.""
Imam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""‘Aa’ishah’s innocence of that of which 
she was accused is stated definitively in the Qur’aan. If anyone doubts that (may Allah protect 
us from such a thing), he becomes a kaafir and an apostate, by the consensus of the Muslims.""
Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""The ummah is agreed that whoever 
slanders her is a kaafir.""
Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer said, in his Tafseer: "" The scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, all 
agreed that whoever accuses or slanders her after the revelation of this aayah is a kaafir, 
because he has rejected the Qur’aan.""
Badr al-Deen al-Zirkashi said: ""Whoever slanders her is a kaafir, because the Qur’aan clearly 
states her innocence.""
The scholars based their ruling on the one who slanders ‘Aa’ishah on the following evidence:
(1)	The evidence that is derived from the verses in Soorat al-Noor that clearly state her 
innocence. So whoever accuses her after Allah has declared her innocent is rejecting the words 
of Allah, which is kufr beyond any shadow of a doubt.
(2)	Slandering the family of the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) hurts and offends the 
Prophet himself, and there is no doubt that whatever hurts and offends the Prophet SAWS 
(peace be upon him) is kufr, by consensus (ijmaa‘). Evidence that the slander of his wife hurt 
and offended the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) is seen in the hadeeth of the slander 
(al-ifk) reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, in which ‘Aa’ishah says: "". . . The Messenger of 
Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) stood up on that day and asked who would go and deal 
with ‘Abdullaah ibn Ubayy. He was on the minbar, and said: ‘O Muslims, who will deal with a 
man who I have heard is speaking in an offensive manner about my family? By Allaah, I know 
nothing but good about my family.’ . . ."" What the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) meant 
was: who will be kind to me, and excuse me if I go and deal with him myself, and I give him 
what he deserves because I have heard that he is speaking in an offensive manner about my 
family. This proves that the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was so deeply offended and 
hurt that he asked people whether they could deal with this person fairly.
Imaam al-Qurtubi said, in his Tafseer of the aayah ""Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and 
warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers."" [al-Noor 24:17]"":
""This is concerning ‘Aa’ishah . . . because of the hurt and offence that the Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) felt with regard to his honour and his family. This is kufr on the 
part of the one who does it."" 
(3)	Slandering ‘Aa’ishah implies insulting the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because 
Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad 
statements (or bad men for bad women). . . "" [al-Noor 24:26]
Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: ""I.e., Allah would not have made 
‘Aa’ishah the wife of the Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) if she had not been 
good, because he is better than any good person. If she had been bad, she would not have 
been fit to marry him from a shar‘i point of view, and Allah would never even have decreed it..""
Finally, let us remember that the most beloved of all people to him 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) 
was ‘Aa’ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, as is proven in the report of ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, 
who said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) put me in charge of an army 
during the ghazwah (campaign) of al-Salaasil. I came to him and asked him, ‘O Messenger of 
Allaah, who among the people is most beloved to you?’ He said, ‘Aa’ishah.’ I asked, ‘Who 
among men?’ He said, ‘Her father.’ I asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘‘Umar,’ then he mentioned 
a number of others."" 
So whoever feels hatred towards the beloved of the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) will deserved to be despised by him on the Day of Resurrection. And Allaah knows

way of knowing to whom his blood will go, he should act according to what he thinks is most 
likely to happen. If he thinks that it is most likely to go to a kaafir who is not fighting the 
Muslims, it is permitted to donate, otherwise it is not."
306,965,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/965,The sick performing Hajj,"Question

                I am a Japanese guy (not Muslim). My Japanese
      friend became a Muslim a few months ago. He wants to go to Mecca (Makkah) to make a
      pilgrimage in the near future, but he has a big injury on his foot, and needs to use a
      crutch.
   Can he go to Makkah? Or can people who are not
      healthy not make the pilgrimage?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says in His Holy Book:
“. . . Hajj to the House [Ka‘bah] is a duty that mankind
    owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision
    and residence]; and whoever disbelieves, then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen
    [mankind and jinn].” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
The scholars’ discussion of the ability to perform Hajj revolves
    around the availability of a means of transport and sufficient money for the journey there
    and back, as well as sufficient funds to cover one’s family’s needs during
    one’s absence, freedom from debt, good health, security on the way, and - for women -
    a mahram (blood relative within the prohibited degrees of marriage, or a husband).
The issue of your Muslim friend revolves around the question of
    health, so we will focus on this matter here:
With regard to the interpretation of the aayah (verse of the
    Qur’aan) quoted above, ‘Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Sabeel
    [paraphrased in the phrase ‘those who can afford the expenses’] means
    health.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).
One of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that a person
    should be free of physical illness and disability that would prevent him from performing
    Hajj. If a person is suffering from a chronic illness, permanent disability, paralysis
    (that makes him unable to walk) or is very old and unable to move about, then there is no
    obligation to perform Hajj.
If a person is able to perform Hajj with the help of another, then it
    becomes a duty to perform Hajj when such help is available. (al-Mawsoo‘ah
    al-Fiqhiyyah, 17/34).
Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “There may be
    different categories of ability. Sometimes a person may be able to perform Hajj by
    himself, and sometimes with the help of others, as is stated in the books of Ahkaam
    (Islamic rulings).” (Tafseer of the aayah previously quoted).
Whoever suffers from a permanent disability that prevents him from
    performing Hajj must appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. If his disability is
    not permanent, then he should wait until he has recovered, then perform Hajj for himself;
    he is not permitted to appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. 
This is the answer to your question, which I hope you will convey to
    your friend. I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your concern and
    interest in finding out the Islamic rulings in this situation which has to do with the
    fifth pillar of Islam. I also wish to encourage and invite you to join us in Islam. Peace
    be with you."
307,973,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/973,It is incorrect to pray Dhuhr after Jumu’ah prayer,"Question

                I heard from some imams that under the following situations we have to 
pray another 4 rakat Fard zuhur prayer (noon prayer) after the 2 rakat 
Juma (Friday) prayer, is it true? if we are far from Saudi Arabia or 
if we are not staying in an Islamic Country or 
if we don't have any Islamic leader as our government in the country 

Kindly answer my question, since I found that many old people they 
follow these in our country, however, I didn't find any Hadith relating to 
these things. 
May Allah (s.w.t) bless you. Thank you.",,"Praise be to Allah.Praying four rakahs after Jumuah prayer is the opinion of some Madhhabs, and has 
nothing to do with staying in Makkah or far away, or being in an Islaamic country or 
not, or whether or not there is a khaleefah. The existence or permission of a khaleefah 
is not a condition for Friday prayers being obligatory or valid, according to Ahl 
al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 8/187)
Having dealt with what you have heard from people who have no knowledge, but who 
are unfortunately in the position of ""imaams,"" as you said, we move on to the basic 
issue of offering salaat al-dhuhr after salaat al-jumuah. Our answer to this question is 
that the truth is the opinion of the scholars, most of whom say that there is no basis in 
shareeah for offering dhuhr prayer after jumuah prayer if a person has prayed 
jumuah. The one who misses jumuah or does not attend it because it is not an 
obligation for him or her, such as women, sick people or travellers, must pray dhuhr. 
It was never reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) or any of his Companions prayed dhuhr after praying jumuah. If he had done 
so, there would be reports to that effect.

308,974,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/974,The kufr of one who rules according to other than    what Allaah revealed,"Question

Is ruling with rules other than sharee‘ah “kufr akbar” or “kufr asghar”?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to refer matters to His judgement and to establish Sharee‘ah, and He has forbidden us to rule with anything else, as is clear from a number of aayaat in the Qur’aan, such as the aayaat in Soorat al-Maa’idah (5) which discuss ruling according to what Allaah has revealed, and mention the following topics:


The command to rule according to what Allaah has revealed: “And so judge between them by what Allaah has revealed . . .” [aayah 49]




Warning against ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed: “. . . and follow not their vain desires . . .” [aayah 49]




Warning against compromising on any detail of Sharee‘ah, no matter how small: “. . . but beware of them lest they turn you far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you . . .” [aayah 49]




Forbidding seeking the ruling of jaahiliyyah, as is expressed in the rhetorical question “Do they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance?” [aayah 50]




The statement that nobody is better than Allaah to judge: “. . . and who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?” [aayah 50]




The statement that whoever does not judge according to what Allaah revealed is a kaafir, a zaalim (oppressor or wrongdoer) and a faasiq (sinner), as Allaah says: “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.” [aayah 44]; “. . . And whoever does not judge by that which Allaah has revealed, such are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)” [aayah 45]; “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed (then) such (people) are the faasiqoon (rebellious or disobedient).” [aayah 47].




The statement that it is obligatory for the Muslims to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, even if those who seek their judgement are not Muslim, as Allaah says: “. . . And if you judge, judge with justice between them. . .” [aayah 42]


Judging or ruling according to other than what Allaah has revealed is contrary to faith and Tawheed, which are Allaah’s rights. It may be counted as kufr akbar (greater kufr) or kufr asghar (lesser kufr) according to circumstances. Kufr akbar will make a person no longer a Muslim in cases such as the following:






If he issues laws and regulations other than those revealed by Allaah, because the right to issue laws belongs to Allaah alone, Who has no partner, and whoever “competes” with Him in a matter which is His alone is a mushrik, because Allaah says: “Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed?” [al-Shooraa 42:21]


If the one who rules by other than that which Allaah has revealed denies the right of Allaah and His Prophet to rule, as is mentioned in Ibn ‘Abbaas’s comment on the aayah:“. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Whoever rejects what Allaah has revealed is a kaafir.”


If he prefers the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is in absolute terms or just in a few matters. Allaah says: “Do they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?” [al-Maa’idah 5:50]


If he regards the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal. Allaah says: “. . . Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).” [al-Baqarah 2:22]


If he thinks that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts the rule of Allaah and His Messenger, or he believes that it is not obligatory to rule according to what Allaah has revealed, or that the matter is optional. This is kufr which is contradictory to faith. Allaah revealed: “O Messenger! Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you, of such who say: ‘We believe’ with their mouths but their hearts have no faith. And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to others who have not come to you; they say, ‘If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!’ . . .” [al-Maa’idah 5:41]. He says: “Go to Muhammad (peace be upon him), and if he tells you that the ruling is lashes, accept it, but if he commands stoning, ignore what he says. Then Allaah revealed “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon (disbelievers)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44].


If he does not rule according to what Allah has revealed out of stubbornness and arrogance, he is a kaafir and has left Islaam, even if he does not deny the rule of Allaah. Stubbornness and arrogance may mean negligence and turning away, as Allaah says: “Have you seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot (false judges, etc.) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shaytaan wishes to lead them astray. And when it is said to them: ‘Come to what Allaah has sent down and to the Messenger,’ see they hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad) with aversion.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:60-61]


Among the things that may be counted as ruling by other than that which Allaah revealed and kufr akbar is what Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem said about man-made laws and ruling by them: “This is the worst, the most obvious and comprehensive opposition to sharee‘ah and rejection of Allaah’s laws. This is competing with Allaah and His Messenger, contradicting His laws in their preparation, support, structure, ruling and references.






The above is a summary of the things that may imply that ruling by other than that which Allah has revealed is a form of shirk akbar (major shirk):
(1) Ruling by other than that which Allaah has revealed.
(2) Denying the right of Allaah and His Messenger to rule.
(3) Preferring the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is complete or only in a few matters.
(4) Regarding the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal.
(5) Thinking that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts what Allaah has revealed, or believing that ruling by what Allaah has revealed is not obligatory or is optional.
(6) Refusing to rule by what Allaah has revealed.
By examining this topic from different angles, it becomes clear that what is counted as kufr akbar is the following:






Abolishing sharee‘ah as the law governing a country, as Mustafa Kemal (“Ataturk”) did in Turkey, as he abolished the book Majallah al-Ahkaam al-‘Adliyyah which was based on the Hanafi madhhab, and replaced it with man-made laws.


Abolishing sharee‘ah courts.


Imposing man-made laws, such as Italian, French, German law, etc., to judge between the people, or mixing these laws and Sharee‘ah, as Genghis Khan did in his book al-Yaasiq, which combined laws from different sources; the ‘ulamaa’ (scholars) ruled that he was a kaafir.


Confining the role of sharee‘ah courts to so-called “civil” matters, such as marriage, divorce and inheritance.


Setting up non-sharee‘ah courts.


Discussing sharee‘ah in parliament and voting on it; this indicates that implementing sharee‘ah is conditional upon a majority vote.


Making sharee‘ah a secondary or main source, along with other sources of law. Even when they say that sharee‘ah is the primary source of legislation, this is still kufr akbar, because it means that they are allowing the adoption of laws from other sources too.


Stating in the clauses of legislation that reference may be made to international law, or stating in treaties that in the case of dispute, the matter may be referred to such-and-such non-Islamic court.


Criticizing sharee‘ah in public or in private, such as saying that it is rigid, incomplete or backward, or suggesting that it is incompatible with our times, or expressing admiration for non-Islamic laws.






As regards the question of when ruling by other than what Allaah revealed is kufr asghar, which does not exclude a person from the ummah of Islam:
the answer is that this may be the case when a ruler or judge passes judgement according to other than what Allaah revealed out of disobedience or on a whim, or as a favour to someone, or because he was bribed, and so on, although he believes that it is obligatory to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, and that what he has done is a sinful and haraam deed.
As regards the one who is governed by a non-Islamic law, if he refers to it out of choice, then he is a kaafir whose kufr akbar means that he has left Islaam. But if he has no choice but to refer to this law, and does so reluctantly, then he is not a kaafir, because if he had been able to resort to sharee‘ah, he would have done so, and he believes that this non-Islamic law is false.
And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
309,975,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/975,What Are the Reasons for Ghusl?,"Question

 
What are all the conditions when ghusl is compulsory?  Is the only time you have to do it is after seminal discharge?","The reasons for ghusl are: the emission of semen, contact between the genitals, menstruation and nifas (post-natal bleeding), and death. Ghusl is recommended on the two ‘Eids, after washing a dead body; before entering ihram or entering Makkah; and for a woman who is suffering from istihadah.","Praise be to Allah.When is ghusl required?
The causes that make ghusl a must are:

The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""What requires water (ghusl ) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you."" (Muslim, no. 1/269)
Contact between the genitals , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of  Allah be upon him) said: ""If one part enters the other part (in another report: if one part touches the other part), then ghusl becomes obligatory."" (Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526) This ghusl is obligatory whether or not fluid (semen) is released. ""Touching"" here refers to the entry of the tip of the penis into the vagina, not mere touching.
Menstruation and nifas (post-natal bleeding), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): "". . . And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you. . ."" [al-Baqarah 2:222] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Fatimah bint Hubaysh, may Allah be pleased with her: ""When your period starts, stop praying, and when your period ends, perform ghusl then start praying again."" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, 309)
Death: the dead - apart from a martyr slain in battle - must be washed (ghusl), because when his daughter Zaynab died, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Wash her with water three or five times, or as many times as you see fit."" (Al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1175) When a man who was in a state of ihram was killed by his riding-beast, he said: ""Wash him with water and lote leaves and wrap him in his two garments, but do not embalm him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing the Talbiyah."" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, 1186)

There are other types of ghusl about which the scholars differed as to whether they are obligatory, such as performing ghusl on Fridays, or whether a person who becomes Muslim needs to perform ghusl upon entering the Faith.
When is ghusl recommended?
There are types of ghusl which are encouraged, such as: ghusl on the two ‘Eids ; ghusl after washing a dead body; ghusl before entering the state of ihram or entering Makkah; ghusl for a woman who is suffering from istihadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding) before every prayer; ghusl after being unconscious; and ghusl after burying a mushrik. (Tamam al-Minnah by al-Albani, p. 120)

310,976,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/976,Najaasah (impurity) of dogs and the ruling on keeping a dog,"Question

 
I am confused as to the position of the dog in Islam. I thought that what is najis is the nose (saliva) and that no other part of the dog is najis, except when it is wet. I also understood that keeping a dog as guard dog etc...is not haram. however, in Malaysia, there is a very strong aversion to the dog amongst Muslim communities to the extent that even in educational religious books produced from this country condemns the dog as najis (throughout) and haram to keep.
I hope you can clarify this.",,"Praise be to Allah. 
The fuqahaa are agreed that it is not permitted to keep a dog unless it is for a purpose, like hunting or guarding property or other uses that are not contrary to the Shareeah. The Prophet (peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for herding, hunting or farming, his reward will decrease by one qiraat every day."" (Reported by Muslim, 2948)
 
As far as keeping a dog to guard the house is concerned, Ibn Qudaamah said: ""It is not permitted, according to the most sound opinion."" (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/124)
 
For more information on this matter, please see question #377 .
 
As regards the najaasah (impurity) of the dog, the Shaafii and Hanbali ulamaa say that the whole dog is essentially naajis (impure). Some scholars say that any liquid excreted by the dog is naajis (not the dog itself). The saliva of the dog is extremely naajis, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away whatever was in it and wash it seven times."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 418).
 
Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The way to purify the vessel of any one of you if a dog has licked it is to wash it seven times, the first time with earth."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 420).
 
We must ensure that Muslims continue to be averse to dogs, even in the midst of what the kuffaar are used to do and what some Muslims have adopted of their habits.

It is sufficient, my sister, if you perform wudoo' before every prayer after the time for it has begun, and do not worry about anything that comes out after that.

I have been discussing the subject of using ""waseela"" while supplicating to Allah (swt) with some Muslims, and have come to know that there are quite different opinions about fact whether the use of ""waseela"" in duaa is halaal or haraam. Could you please provide me with some information about this subject, some ayaat from the Holy Quran or authentic ahaadeeth? With the term ""use of waseela"" I mean asking via the agency of someone, fx ""I ask You (O Allah) to grant me forgiveness via the agency of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him and his household)"" or via the agency of other Prophets (Peace be upon them), saints or other pious Muslims.",,"Praise be to Allah.What is meant by tawassul and waseelah is four things:


the kind of tawassul without which faith cannot be complete, which is seeking to reach Allah (tawassul) by believing in Him and His Messengers, and obeying Him and His Messenger, This is what is meant in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):


O you who believe! Do your duty to Allah and fear Him. Seek the means of approach to Him [Al-Maaidah 5:35]
This includes seeking to approach Allah through His Names and Attributes, or by doing acts of obedience and worship by which one seeks to approach Allah, and so on.
Seeking to approach Allah by asking His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to make dua for one during his lifetime, and the believers asking one another to make duaa for one another. This follows on from the first type and is encouraged.
Seeking to approach Allah by virtue of the status and virtues of some created being, such as saying, O Allah, I ask You by virtue of Your Prophet and so on. This is allowed by some of the ulama, but this opinion is daeef (weak). The correct view is that it is definitely haraam, because there can be no tawassul in duaa except by virtue of the Names and Attributes of Allah.
Tawassul as it is understood by many of the Muslims of later times, which is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and seeking his help (or seeking the help of the dead and so-called awliya). This is a form of major shirk, because calling on or seeking help from anyone other than Allah with regard to something that that only Allah is able to do is a kind of worship, and directing worship to anyone or anything other than Allah is major shirk.

314,983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/983,Can Women Go to the Mosque?,"Question

Here in my country (Surinam, South America), the Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah forbid women to go to the mosque, saying that the first Imam (Imam Abu Hanifah) learned to do what pleases the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and he had said once that it is better for the women to perform prayer at home, because there is more reward in that, and as we come here to earn reward, it is better to do this.
Is it right to forbid women to go to the mosque? If so, where in the Holy Quran or the hadith can I find this?","Women's prayer at home is better than praying in the mosque, but this does not mean that women are not permitted to go to the mosque.","Praise be to Allah.Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque?
There is no doubt that a woman’s prayer in her house is better for her than praying in the mosque, as is indicated by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: ""Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila’l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 7458)

Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""A woman’s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila’l-masjid. See also Sahh al-Jami‘, no. 3833).

Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa‘idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you."" He said: ""I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque."" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she met Allah (i.e., until she died). (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy)
Can women go to mosques?
But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith:
From ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, who said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ‘Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.’"" Bilal ibn ‘Abdullah said, ""By Allah, we will prevent them."" (Ibn ‘Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: ""I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say ‘By Allah, we will prevent them’!!"" (Reported by Muslim, 667)
Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques
But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows:

She should wear complete hijab .
She should not go out wearing perfume .
She should have the permission of her husband.

Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so.

                Is it permissible to hold the Jummah Khutbah in English if the majority of the community does not understand Arabic? Have the scholars agreed on this issue or is there a difference of opinions?",,"Praise be to Allah.Some of the scholars said 
          that it is not permitted to translate the khutbah given from the minbar 
          on Friday and the two Eids into foreign (non-Arabic) languages. Their 
          intention (may Allaah have mercy on them) was to maintain and preserve 
          the Arabic language, and to follow the way of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may 
          Allaah be pleased with them), which was to give the khutbah in Arabic 
          in the lands of the Persians and others, and to encourage the people 
          to learn Arabic and pay attention to it.  
Other scholars said that 
          it is permissible to translate khutbahs into other languages if most 
          of the people being addressed do not know Arabic, based on the reason 
          for which Allaah enjoined the khutbah, which is to teach the people 
          about the rulings that Allaah has prescribed for them and to tell them 
          of the sins which are forbidden, to guide them towards good characteristics 
          and to warn them against bad characteristics. Undoubtedly paying attention 
          to the aims and purposes is more important and takes precedence over 
          paying attention to the words used, especially when the audience does 
          not understand Arabic and the khutbah does not have any effect on them 
          and does not motivate them to learn Arabic. (Especially in these times 
          when the Muslims have fallen behind and others have advanced, and the 
          language of the dominant people has become widespread and the language 
          of the defeated is in a weaker position).  
If 
          the aim of conveying knowledge and Islamic teaching to the people can 
          only be achieved among non-Arabs by translating the khutbahs into their 
          languages, then the view that it is permissible to translate the khutbah 
          into the prevalent language of the audience so that they may understand 
          what is being said takes precedence and should be followed, especially 
          if not translating the khutbahs will lead to conflicts and arguments. 
          Undoubtedly translating the khutbah in such a case becomes essential 
          to serve the people’s interests and avoid mischief.
 If 
          there are some people in the congregation who do understand Arabic, 
          then the khateeb should combine the two languages, giving the khutbah 
          in Arabic then repeating it in the other language which the other people 
          understand. In this manner he will achieve the two purposes, avoiding 
          mischief and conflict among the people whom he is addressing.
 There 
          is a great deal of evidence to support that in the pure sharee’ah, such 
          as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
          We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order 
          that he might make (the Message) clear for them.” 
[Ibraaheem 
          14:4] 
         And 
          the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Zayd ibn Thaabit 
          to learn the language of the Jews so that he might send letters to them 
          in their language and establish proof against them, and so that he might 
          read their letters when they were sent, and explain to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what they said. And when 
          the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) attacked the Romans and 
          Persians, they did not fight them until they had called them to Islam 
          by means of interpreters. When they conquered the foreign countries 
          they called the people to Allaah in Arabic and commanded the people 
          to learn it. Whoever among them did not know Arabic, they called him 
          in his own language and made him understand what was meant in the language 
          that he did understand. Thus proof was established. Undoubtedly this 
          is the only way, especially at the end of time when Islam is like a 
          stranger and every people is clinging to its own language. There is 
          a very real need for translation now, and the daa’iyah cannot convey 
          his message without it.
       

The khateeb should do that which best suits the interests of the people 
          he is addressing. If the best is to give the khutbah part by part, in 
          Arabic and then translated, then he should do that. If the best is to 
          translate the entire khutbah, after giving the khutbah (in Arabic) or 
          after the prayer, then he should do that. And Allaah knows best."

      what can i do and how can I handle situation like this what can I do please helb me.
     thank you",,"Praise be to Allah.Before we find out what the Quraan says about despising 
  others because of their origins, we should know what the Quraan says about 
  having girlfriends. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 Wed them with the permission of their own folk and 
  give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be 
  chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]
In his commentary on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have 
  mercy on him) said: 
Muhsanaat [translated as chaste] means 
  that they should be pure, not indulging in zinaa (unlawful sexual conduct), 
  hence they are described as not being musaafihaat, which means promiscuous 
  women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them 
  Ibn Abbaas said: muttakhidhaati akhdaan means lovers. 
   Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend.  
  Allaah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that 
  situation
Now that you know the Islamic ruling on this matter and are sure 
  that what you have done is haraam and sinful, we will now move on to what Allaah 
  says about despising others for their origins. Allaah says (interpretation of 
  the meaning):
O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, 
  it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff 
  at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former 
  [al-Hujuraat 49:11]
Allaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they 
  may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished 
  from one another and thus get to know one another. Allaah says (interpretation 
  of the meaning):
O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, 
  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, 
  the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. 
  is one of the muttaqeen  the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. 
  [al-Hujuraat 49:13]
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary 
  on this aayah:
Here Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from 
  one soul, from which He created its mate  this refers to Aadam and Hawwa 
  (Adam and Eve)  and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. 
  Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families 
  and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers 
  to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are 
  equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, 
  upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, 
  i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding 
  envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality 
  as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, 
  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another  
  i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid 
  said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, 
  from such-and-such a tribe.  Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger 
  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable? He said: The 
  most honourable in the sight of Allaah are the most pious (those who have most 
  taqwa). They said, That is not what we were asking about. 
  He said: The most honourable of people is Yoosuf the Prophet of Allaah, 
  the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son 
  of the Friend (khaleel) of Allaah. They said: That is not 
  what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage 
  of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes. He said: 
  The best of you at the time of Jaahiliyyah are the best of you in Islam, 
  if they understand properly. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased 
  with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look 
  at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your 
  deeds.

317,992,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/992,Where Is Allah?,"Question

Some people say that Allah is above the heavens (according to one of the verses of the Quran), and may scholars say that Allah exists without a place, since only the creation has the characteristic of needing a place and we know the ayah ""Laysa-ka-mithli-he-shay"" - (proving Allah does not resemble His creation); is He everywhere, existing without a place, or above the heavens?","The people of Sunnah and Jama`ah believe that Allah is above heaven because of the evidence of the Quran, Sunnah, consensus of the scholars, common sense and man’s innate instinct (Fitrah).","Praise be to Allah.The people of Sunnah and Jama`ah (adherents to the prophetic way) believe that Allah is exalted above His creation because of the evidence of the Quran, Sunnah (prophetic traditions), consensus of the scholars, common sense and man’s innate instinct (fitrah).
Evidence from the Quran that Allah is above His creation
The Quran describes the ""exaltedness"" or ""highness"" of Allah in different ways, as His being high and above, and by describing how things come down from Him, and go up to Him, and by stating that He is above heaven . For example (interpretations of the meaning):

(Highness):
	""… and He is the Most High, the Most Great."" [2:255]
	""Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High."" [87:1]
(Above):
	""And He is the Irresistible, above His slaves …"" [6:18]
	""They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded."" [16:50]
(Things coming down from Him):
	""He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth … "" [32:5]
	""Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran) …"" [15:9]
(Things going up to Him):
	""… To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it …"" [35:10]
	""The angels and the Ruh (Jibril) ascend to Him …"" [70:4]
(Allah is above heaven):
	""Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you …?"" [67:16]

Evidence form the Sunnah that Allah is above His creation
Many reports were narrated ""Mutawatir"" (i.e. with a large number of narrators at every stage of the isnad/chain, such that it is impossible for them all to have agreed on a lie) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), describing his words and deeds and things of which he approved. 

For example, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say ""Subhana Rabbi Al-A`la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)"" in Sujud (prostration), and in some Hadiths (reports) he is reported to have said ""By Allah Who is above the Throne.""
Among his deeds is the gesture of pointing up with his finger, when addressing the people in the greatest gathering, on the Day of `Arafah during his Farewell Pilgrimage. He asked the people, ""Have I not conveyed the message?"" and they said, ""Yes!"" He asked again, ""Have I not conveyed the message?"" and they said, ""Yes!"" He asked a third time, “Have I not conveyed the message?"" and they said ""Yes!"" Each time, he said: ""O Allah, bear witness!"" - pointing up to the sky and then at the people. He also used to raise his hands towards heaven when he made Du`a (supplication), as reported in many Hadiths. This is proof via his actions that Allah is exalted and high.
An example of an approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that Allah is Exalted and High is the Hadith (report) concerning the young slave girl, to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Where is Allah?"" She said: ""In heaven (menaing above heaven, as explained in the answer to question #124469)."" He asked, ""Who am I?"" She said, ""The Messenger of Allah."" So he said to her master: ""Set her free, for she is a believer.""
	This young girl was uneducated, as many are, and she was a slave, but she knew that her Lord is above heaven . Some misguided people deny that Allah is above heaven , and say, ""He is neither above nor below; neither to the right nor to the left. He is everywhere!""

The consensus of the scholars that Allah is above His creation
The Salaf (pious predecessors) agreed that Allah is above heaven, as is reported by scholars such as Adh-Dhahabi, may Allah have mercy on him, in his book Al-`Aluw lil `Ali Al-Ghaffar.
Evidence form common sense that Allah is above His creation
Highness is a quality which is associated in people’s minds with perfection. If this is the case, then it should be attributed to Allah because every absolute perfection should be attributed to Him.
Evidence form the innate instinct of man that Allah is above His creation
There should be no dispute that man instinctively knows that Allah is above heaven. Whenever something overwhelming befalls a person, and he turns to Allah for help, he looks towards heaven, not in any other direction. But it is strange that those who deny that Allah is above His creation still raise their hands in supplication to no other direction than towards heaven.
Even Pharaoh, the enemy of Allah who disputed with Musa (peace be upon him) about his Lord, told his minister Haman (interpretation of the meaning):
""O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the god of Musa …"" [40:36-37]
He knew in his heart of hearts that Allah is real, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And they belied them (those ayat/signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof …"" [27:14]
These are a few of the indications that Allah is above the heavens; this proof comes from the Quran, the Sunnah, the consensus of the scholars, common sense, man’s own instincts and even the words of the non-Muslims.
We ask Allah to guide us towards the Truth.

318,996,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/996,Wudu is a prerequisite for wiping on socks,"Question

Is it permissible to do masah(wiping) on the socks even if one did not have wudu prior to putting on his socks. Example: It is hard to wash ones feet at their business, because people think we are making a mess.",,"Praise be to Allah.First: A Muslim must be proud of his religion and not feel ashamed of its rites and rituals being performed in front of others, or of what shari’ah imposes upon him. If he fears that seeing the implementation of a religious practice or ruling may cause the unbelievers to have an aversion to the religion, then he wisely conceals, aiming at presenting Islam gradually and in an appropriate way. This doesn’t mean to be ashamed or weak or feeling disgrace from implementation of some religious rituals.
I suspect you fear from their disapproval because of their misunderstanding, inverted senses, and spoiled opinions, ideas, and inclinations. How could the removal of one’s socks and the washing of one’s feet be considered filthy or disgusting, when the fact that is that it effects cleanliness and the removal of sweat and unpleasant odor from the feet?
Second: It is not permissible for the person to pass wet hands over the socks unless he put them on in a state of purity. You can find the evidence in the following Hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah Ibn-Shu’bah, may Allah be pleased with him, in which he said:
""I was traveling with our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Prophet asked me saying, ""Have you got any water?"" I said, ""Yes"" … and poured out water so that the Prophet washed his face and hands... and his arms then wiped his head. Then I bent over to pull off his khuff (a type of thick sock) but the Prophet said ""Leave them for I put on my khuff in a state of purification"" then he wiped over them. (narrated by Al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari No. # 5353)
Ibn Hajar, may Allah bless him, quoted the following in his explanation of the portion of this Hadith in which the Prophet’s said ""I put them on a state of purification"":
Al-Hamidy related in his Musnad that the Prophet was asked whether one could pass wet hands over the khuff, the Prophet answered saying: ""Yes if the person puts them on in a state of purification.""
Ibn Khuzayma said that according to Hadith narrated by Safwan Ibn Assal, ""the Prophet ordered us to wipe over khuff if we put them on in a state of purification, for 3 days during traveling and for one day and night in residency"".
Safwan’s hadith, although it is sahih, does not meet the conditions defined by Al-Bukhari. But al-Mughirah’s hadith is in agreement with it in its indication of the stipulation of being in a pure state before putting on the socks.
Third: It is in fact easy to solve your problem; all you need to do is perform the complete ablution at home before going to work, washing your feet, then put on your socks. Then, if you want to perform ablution again at work, you can pass your wet fingertips over the back (i.e., top) of each foot.

If a woman's body has been altered so much during her pregnancies that she feels ashamed to show herself in front of her husband, is she allowed to have plastic surgery?","If the disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce an incidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it.","Praise be to Allah.Ruling on performing plastic surgery
Your question revolves around the ruling on performing plastic surgery, on which we will give you a brief summary.
Doctors who specialize in plastic or cosmetic surgery define it as surgery performed to improve the appearance of part of the body. This may be done by choice, or because it is necessary.
Plastic surgery that is considered necessary is that which is done when there is a need for it, when something does not look right, when something is missing, if there is too much or too little of something, or because something has been destroyed or deformed . At the same time, it is regarded as cosmetic surgery because it results in improved appearance.
Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery
Faults may be of two types: physical or congenital faults and faults which result from illness. Congenital faults include abnormally turned-out lips , hare-lips, twisted fingers or toes, etc. Faults which result from illness include the scars left by leprosy or other skin diseases, or scars caused by accidents and burns. 
There is no doubt that such faults and scars cause physical and psychological pain and harm, therefore Islam allows people afflicted with them to remove or reduce them by surgical means. They cause the kind of mental and psychological pain that allows this surgery as an urgent need, where necessity permits something that is ordinarily forbidden. 
Any cosmetic surgery which comes under this heading of need because of the fact that the reason for the surgery is causing harm is permissible, and is not considered to be changing the creation of Allah.
Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden 
To further understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden, we will quote the words of al-Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on the hadith: 
“Allah has cursed the women who make tattoos and the women who have this done, the women who pluck facial(eyebrow) hair and the women who have this done, and women who widen the gap between their own or others teeth for the sake of beauty, changing what Allah has created.” (Sahih Muslim, 3966)
Al-Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The woman who tattoos is one who uses a needle or similar implements to prick the skin of the hand, wrist, lips or other part of a woman's body until she draws blood, then she puts dye into the wound. It is haram to do this or have it done by choice. Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haram, whether one does it or asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haram to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger. It is haram to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadith, and because it involves changing what Allah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood. Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look beautiful, which indicates that what is haram is when this is done in the pursuit of beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best.” (al-Nawawi, commentary on Sahih Muslim, 13/107)
We should point out here that cosmetic surgeons do not distinguish between cases of serious need and other cases. Their concern is to earn money and satisfy their customers. Materialists and proponents of freedom think that man is free and can do whatever he wants with his body, but this is wrong; the body belongs to Allah and He can command whatever He wills concerning it. 
Allah has told us about the ways in which Iblis (Shaytan) promised to lead people astray, one of which is (interpretation of the meaning): “and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.” [al-Nisa 4:119]
Haram cosmetic surgical procedures
There are cosmetic surgical procedures which are haram and are not considered to be excusable; these are seen as tampering with the creation of Allah for the sake of beauty. Examples include: breast enlargement or reduction, and procedures aimed at reversing the signs of ageing, such as face-lifts etc. 
The Islamic view is that these are not permitted, because there is no urgent need or necessity for them; rather, the aim is to change and tamper with the creation of Allah for reasons of human vanity. This is haram and the one who does it is cursed because it involves two things mentioned in the hadith: pursuit of beauty and changing what Allah has created.
Added to this is the fact that these operations are aimed at deceit, and may involve the injection of materials extracted from aborted foetuses. These are very serious crimes. Moreover, many of these operations result in ongoing pain and other side effects, as the specialists themselves say. (See Ahkam al-Jirahah (Rulings on surgery) by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti).
On the basis of the above, we say to you: if the disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce an accidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it, in sha Allah. 
And Allah knows best."

from accepting or eating any food article (not necessarily of animals slaughtered in 
names other than of Allah) which are offered here in India, after Fatehakhani done in 
the names of saintly persons like Abdul Qadar Jeelani?",,"Praise be to Allah.The meaning of the Quranic Verse: ""Forbidden to you (for food) are: ..., and that on which has 
been invoked the name of other than Allah,..."" (Al-Baqarah, or the heifer, V173)

Ibn Kathir (May Allah have mercy on him) said in explanation of the above Verse:
""..that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,..."" means slaughtered animals 
on which has been invoked a name other than the name of Allah; such as an idol, an antagonist, 
an arrow of divination and the like for which Arabs of pre-Islamic periods slaughtered animals.
In explanation of Verse 3 of Surat al-Ma’ida, or the table, Ibn Kathir said: ""The Verse: ""..., and 
that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,..."" means that eating of animal 
food on which, upon slaughtering a name other than Allah is invoked is forbidden because Allah, 
the Exalted, prescribed that His Great Name be invoked upon slaughtering any of His creatures. It 
is the unanimous opinion that one is forbidden to select to invoke a name of an idol of any 
creature upon slaughtering an animal.
In explanation of the Verse ""... that which is sacrificed on stone (altars)..."", Mujahid and Ibn 
Jurayj said: Those were stones (altars) put around the Ka’bah. Ibn Jurayj said: There were 360 
stones (altars) at which pre-Islamic Arabs used to slaughter animal ... They would grill meat and 
put it on these stones.. Allah forbade such act and disallowed eating of such meat even if the 
name of Allah is invoked on it. Slaughtering of animal at stones (altars) is part of polytheism, 
which is prohibited by Allah and His Messenger. Comparison should be made to the foregoing to 
decide the rule for slaughtering of animals on which is invoked other than the name of Allah.
All slaughtered animals on which a name other than the name of Allah; such is the name of a 
prophet, a holy man, an idol, the devil, or an item of worship such as the cross and the like may 
not be eaten."

I would like to know which foods increase the sexual desire in the human body, and what element in food is responsible for this.",,"Praise be to Allah.We urge you to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to food. It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’diYakrab said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to give him enough strength. If his desire for food overwhelms him, then let him fill one-third with food, one-third with drink and leave one-third for air.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-At’imah, 3340; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 2704). Hence some of the scholars included this hadeeth under the heading of controlling desires. You should also fast a lot, heeding the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever is not able to do that then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677).

What is the evidence on celebrating birthdays?

It is not permitted to accept invitations to birthday celebrations , because this involves supporting and encouraging bid’ah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not allowed…?” [Al-Shura 42:21]
“Then We have put you (O Muhammad) on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that, and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah (if He wants to punish you). Verily, the wrongdoers are protectors to one another, but Allah is the Protector of the pious.” [Al-Jathiyah 45:18-19]
“Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any awliya (protectors, helpers, etc.) besides Him. Little do you remember!” [Al-A’raf 7:3]
According to sahih reports, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim); and “The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which have been newly invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.” There are many other ahadith that convey the same meaning.
Besides being bid’ah and having no basis in shari’ah, these birthday celebrations also involve imitation of the Jews and Christians in their birthday celebrations. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, warning us against following their ways and traditions: “You would follow the ways of those who came before you step by step, to such an extent that if they were to enter a lizard’s hole, you would enter it too.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).

33(Since I do not know Arabic):

her real father's name? Her real father is muslim, but she calls 
him daddy, and for the sake of unity in the home, we want her 
to call her stepfather Abi like the others do.",,"Praise be to Allah.
Before answering this question, it will be useful to shed more light on the 
issue of adoption and giving a child a name or lineage that is not really his.
In Islam, adoption (i.e., giving your name to a child who is not yours) is 
haraam, and is considered to be a major sin because of the wrongdoing 
and corruption that result from it. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
meaning): ""Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that 
is more just with Allaah"" [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. 
The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) said: ""Whoever claims knowingly to belong to someone other than his 
father will be denied Paradise."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, Fath, no. 
3982). He also said: ""Whoever claims to belong to someone other than his 
father, will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people, and Allaah 
will not accept any deeds or excuses from him on the Day of 
Resurrection."" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 
2433).
In his commentary on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi said: ""This is clearly stating 
the emphatic prohibition of claiming to belong to anyone other than one's 
real father because this involves ingratitude and a denial of the rights of 
inheritance, as well as cutting family ties and undutifulness to parents."" 
(al-Nawawi's statement ends). It also involves not carrying out the rules of 
inheritance, and ignoring the prohibited degrees of marriage to women [i.e. a 
man may unknowingly marry someone he is not permitted to, such as a sister, when true 
origins are concealed by not calling a child after his real father - translator's note], etc.
If a man wants to sponsor an orphan, the child must still be named after his 
father, if his name is known; it is not permissible to attribute this child to 
himself by giving him his name. If the child's real origins are not known, 
then he should be given an appropriate name by which he may be known to 
others, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Call them (adopted 
sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah. But if 
you know not their father's (names, call them) your brothers in faith "" 
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
In answer to your question, which has to do with a girl - for example - 
addressing the one who is sponsoring her and bringing her up as ""Father"" 
or ""Daddy,"" Shaykh 'Abd al-'Azeez ibn Baaz has issued a fatwa (ruling) 
stating that this is allowed, because he is acting in the position of a father to 
her, and we should not be so strict in this matter.
Note:	If a man is sponsoring a very young girl (less than two years old) he 
should try to establish the relationship of mahram by letting her breastfeed 
from his wife, mother or sister, so that she will become his mahram, 
otherwise he has to make sure that she does not uncover (take off her 
hijaab) in front of him when she grows up. The exception to this is a 
step-daughter (his wife's daughter from a previous marriage); she does not 
have to wear hijaab in front of her mother's husband even if no relationship 
is established through breastfeeding (al-radaa')."

According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered. However, some scholars allow uncovering the feet.","Praise be to Allah.The free woman who has attained the age of maturity is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer , apart from her face and hands, because all of her body is `Awrah. If she prays and any part of her `Awrah becomes uncovered , such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said:
""Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a Khimar (covering)"" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi, with an authentic chain of narration)
Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a Dir’ (chemise or upper garment) and a Khimar (head cover), but no Izar (lower garment). He said: ""The woman is `Awrah.""
As for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer , so long as no Non-Mahram men are present. 
According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered ; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite. 
Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a Khimar and Qamis (dress or gown). She said, ""There is nothing wrong with it if the Dir’ (chemise) covers her feet."" In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side.
As far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.

    T-shirts","Question

                Salam.There are T-shirts currently available in my area with the word
      ""Allah"" written on it. The issue has been raised that this is wrong because
      people may abuse the T-shirt by wearing it or throwing it on the floor out of
      carelessness. Also, it has been asked whether it can be worn to the toilet.What is your opinion on the matter ?Jazakallah.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to buy or wear these T-shirts, and the one who
    wears them should be denounced, because they involve disrespect towards the name of
    Allaah, which is bound to be mistreated by being printed on these shirts, whether they are
    thrown in places where Allaah’s name should not be put, such as in bathrooms
    (especially when they get dirty and need washing) or are mistreated in other ways. If you
    and other Muslims refrain from buying these shirts, this will narrow the market for them,
    which will force the producers – if their aim is merely commercial – to stop
    printing them. And Allaah knows best."

What are the confirmed sunnah prayers (Al-Sunan Al-Rawatib)? And when should they be performed?","The confirmed sunnah prayers are:
1- 4 rak’ahs before Zhuhr; 
2- 2 rak’ahs after Zhuhr; 
3- 2 rak’ahs after Maghrib; 
4- 2 rak’ahs after ‘Isha; and
5- 2 rak’ahs before the Fajr.","Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question about al-sunan al-rawatib is a Hadith by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in which he said:
""Allah will build a house in Heaven for whoever is diligent in observing 12 Sunnah Rak'at (as follows): 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr (Midday) Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib (Sunset Prayer), 2 after the ‘Isha (Evening) Prayer and 2 before the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer."" (Hadith sahih narrated by at-Tirmidhi No. 379 and by others. Hadith No. 6183 in Sahih al-Jami’.)
Anbasah ibn Abi Sufyan quoted Umm Habibah as saying ""Allah’s Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) said:
""A house will be built in Heaven for one who prays 12 Rak'at in a day and evening as follows: 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib Prayer, 2 after the ‘Isha Prayer and 2 before the Fajr Prayer.""

The ‘Asr (Late-Afternoon) Prayer has no routine Sunnah (basic recommended voluntary prayer). However, it is mustahab (preferable and recommended) that one prays 4 Rak'at before the ‘Asr Prayer. The 4 Rak'ahs are of less reward and significance in importance of adhering to them compared to the ""sunan al-rawatib"" described above. The 4 Rak'ahs are the ones intended by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in saying: ""May Allah have mercy on one who prays 4 rak’at before the ‘Asr Prayer."" (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi no. 395 and he declared it a hassan and gharib Hadith. Al-Albany rated the Hadith as hassan in Sahih al-Jami’ No. 3493.)
All the foregoing 4-Rak'ah voluntary prayers are to be prayed two at a time according to Imam ash-Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad.

      singing parties and soirees","Question

                In
      some cities and regions it is very common to people to organize singing
      parties and soirees where they listen to songs and trilling songs or
      verses from the local area and elsewhere, or to stage series of plays in
      some literary clubs, to which they invite singers and actors from all
      over. Sometimes entrance to these events is by tickets which are sold, and
      sometimes these events are free.
      My question, O Shaykh, is: what
      is the ruling on organizing these parties and soirees, and what is the
      ruling on attending them for the purpose of relaxation and leisure? Is it
      permissible for me to join in with them in singing these songs etc.?
      Please give us a fatwaa, may Allaah reward you, because this is a
      confusing matter. Some people say that there is nothing wrong with this
      because it is only entertainment, and others say that it is haraam and is
      not permitted. May Allaah bless you and benefit Islam through you.

      watching them in private and in public. They should know that He can see
      them and that nothing at all is hidden from Him on the earth or in the

“And
      take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is
      At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!”
      [al-Baqarah 2:197] –
      i.e., O you whose minds are aware and whose hearts are alive, strive to
      please Allaah by doing that which will bring you benefits in this world
      and in the Hereafter. Those who are not “men of understanding” are
      those who waste their efforts and their minds in things that earn the
      wrath of Allaah.
What
      the questioner has asked about, organizing singing parties and soirees to
      which singers and actors from all over are invited, to which entrance is
      free or there is a charge, and attending or watching these events, or
      taking part in them or supporting them – all of that is haraam and is
      not permitted, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And
      of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead
      (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of
      Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there
      will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).” [Luqmaan 31:6]
Ibn Mas’ood
      – may Allaah be pleased with him – used to swear that what this
      referred to was singing, because undoubtedly singing misleads people far
      away from the path of Allaah by wasting their time. It was reported from
      Abu ‘Aamir and Ibn Maalik al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with them)
      that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will permit illegal
      sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical instruments…”
      (narrated by al-Bukhaari). The meaning of the phrase “[they] will permit
      illegal sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical
      instruments…” is that these things are basically haraam. The word
      translated as “there will be” refers to something which will happen in
      the future. What this means is that there will be people who regard as
      halaal and allow themselves things that are haraam, such as zinaa, silk
      and musical instruments.  
It was
      reported from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report:
      “In this ummah there will be landslides, stones falling from heaven and
      transformation (of humans into monkeys, etc.). This will happen when
      alcohol is drunk, when people bring in female singers and play musical
      instruments.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi).
No doubt the
      things that bring about these punishments are haraam, and are in fact
      major sins – laa hawla wa laa quwwata
      illa Billaah (there is no strength and no power except with
      Allaah). The earlier scholars, such as Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy
      on him) stated that musical instruments – such as the ‘ood (lute),
      tanboor (long-necked stringed instrument similar to a mandolin), shabbaab
      (reed flute) and rabaab (stringed instrument resembling a fiddle) – are
      haraam, so the instruments that are known nowadays, which cause far more
      fitnah (temptation) are even more haraam than those which were known to
      the earlier scholars. Therefore: it is haraam to organize singing
      parties such as these. Let those who organize them fear Allaah, and let
      those who are in positions of authority fear Allaah and not take their
      children and families to these places. Let them realize that they are
      sinning by doing so, and tomorrow they will be asked about what they have
      done. Let them know that they can find relaxation in obeying Allaah and
      adhering to His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him), by fasting, visiting the Haramayn
      (Makkah and Madeenah), and by striving in jihaad for the sake of Allaah,
      spreading the religion of Allaah and calling others to Islam, and other
      kinds of good and righteous deeds. They can also find relaxation in other
      permissible activities, such as learning to swim, shoot and ride horses,
      as well as sailing, going to gardens and parks, etc., so long as they
      observe Islamic etiquette and good manners. May Allaah help us all to do
      what is good and right, and keep us away from the things that will earn
      His wrath and painful punishment. And Allaah knows best."

Prophets (upon whom be peace)? Even if it means enforcing 
laws on non-Muslims?
Partciluarly, is it permissible to enforce a law like punishing 
someone for speeding on the highway? What about allowing 
someone to drink alcohol if he is over 21 but not if he is 
under 21? Even though this is not Islamic, should a Muslim 
allow such behaviour among non-Muslims? Of course, 
Muslims will be accountable for these haraam actions in the 
Hereafter, but is it okay to let non-Muslims do this?",,"Praise be to Allah.
If a Muslim is able, through such work, to fight evil and oppression, or to 
prevent or reduce it by using the existing laws which may contain 
something of justice and decency, then it is permissible if his intention is 
to seek the pleasure of Allah. He may do this work even if it involves 
preventing only some people - but not all - from getting drunk, for 
example.
But if it involves enforcing laws that are unjust to people - whether they 
are Muslim or not - or enforcing something that goes against the 
Sharee'ah, like preventing people from wearing hijaab or praying, or 
giving some kind of protection to criminals, and so on, then this is not 
permitted at all.
The wise and clever Muslim knows from experience to what extent his 
work is in accordance with the Sharee'ah that is based on the common 
good and on preventing corruption. And Allaah knows best."

                There is a sect which is no less
      dangerous than the sect which rejects the Sunnah altogether; they say, “We accept the
      Sunnah as a source of legislation for matters of worship, but when it comes to legislation
      or conduct in the matters of this world, we are not obliged to follow any part of the
      Sunnah in this regard,” and they cling to weak evidence, such as the incident of the
      pollination of the date-palm trees. How should we respond to them?",,"Praise be to Allah.The story of the pollination of the date-palm trees describes how, when
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah, he saw the
    people there pollinating the date-palm trees by hand, and he said to them, “If you do
    not do this, it should still be fine.” So they did not do it, and the crop failed,
    producing only bad dates. He passed by them and said, “What is wrong with your
    date-palms?” They said, “You told us such-and-such.” He said, “You
    know best about the affairs of your world.” (Reported by Muslim, 4358).
    This report, if it indicates anything, indicates that
    with regard to worldly matters that have nothing to do with halaal and haraam or right and
    wrong, but are matters of trial and error, do not come under the mission of the Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as the conveyor of the Message from His Lord.
    This hadeeth indicates that these matters are subject to trial and error. The Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set us a practical example to encourage us, in
    worldly matters that have nothing to do with legislation, to do our utmost to find out
    which way of dealing with them is best, to research and explore these matters, to analyze
    our findings and observations, and to do other things that would help us to develop and
    make progress in the fields of agriculture, industry, construction and so on. In matters
    on which sharee’ah is silent and did not give any specific ruling, we are permitted
    to act within the general guidelines of Islam, such as the principle of not causing or
    reciprocating harm, and so on.
There is a big difference between this incident and its implications,
    and the reports in which the Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated
    that things were halaal or haraam, or that something would lead to punishment or not, or
    that certain transactions are valid or not, and other worldly or religious matters,
    because these formed the main part of his mission, and Allaah has commanded us to obey the
    Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in everything that he has conveyed
    from his Lord. (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 1/45).
    Those who try to confine Islam only to rituals of
    worship, such as prayer, fasting and Hajj, and want to separate religion from other
    aspects of life such as the social, economic and political spheres, and say that these are
    human affairs in which people can do whatever they want and can legislate and govern
    however they wish – these people are kaafirs and wrongdoers who do not want to make
    the sharee’ah of Allaah prevail in people’s lives or to allow Islam to guide the
    people’s affairs, even though Allaah has revealed it to govern and control and
    regulate, and life cannot be properly run and people cannot be happy without it. Without
    Islamic rule, people are lost and confused in the darkness, as we see today in all those
    societies that are not ruled by the sharee’ah of Allaah. We ask Allaah to guide us
    and to open our eyes and help us to accept and follow Islam. May Allaah bless our Prophet
    Muhammad."

Is this permissible?",,"Praise be to Allah.This swearing by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is haraam, and is a kind of Shirk, because swearing by something implies veneration of it, and a created being cannot venerate another created being. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by anything other than Allaah is guilty of kufr or shirk.”
(Saheeh, narrated by Ahmad, 2/125; Abu Dawood, 3251; al-Tirmidhi, 1535). This applies to swearing by the Prophets, angels, righteous people and all other created beings.

My question has two parts: 
First, what is the position of a man accepting Islam with a Christian wife, and practicing Islam independently of her, and 
Second, what of a promise to raise my children in a religion other than Islam.  Obviously, I would seek to expose them to Islam, but I am wondering about things such as supporting her desire to have them attend her church, etc.Thanks very much, (name witheld).",,"Praise be to Allah.Dear (name witheld),

As-salaamu 'ala man ittaba'a al-huda
(peace be upon those who follow the true guidance).
I was delighted to learn of your serious consideration and possible intention to accept the Islamic religion.  No doubt that step would be the greatest thing in the entire NN years of your life.  This step is the one that will protect you from the everlasting punishment of Hell and open to you the path to Heaven after death and will result in success and happiness in this life and the hereafter.  I advise you to hasten with your decision and do not hesitate and postpone.  You seem to me to be of sound wisdom that will lead you the path of truth by the will of God (Allaah).


As for your first question, it is permissible in the Islamic religion for a Muslim to marry a woman from the People of the Book (Christain or Jew) if she is chaste (i.e. of high moral character) and virtuous, as Allaah has stated in the noble Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning of verse number 5 in the chapter entitled ""Al-Maa'ida,"" The Table):


""This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them.  (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues (girlfriends or lovers)...""


Based on this verse, your marriage contract will remain valid if you accept Islaam and become a Muslim, and it will not require renewal.  Your remaining with your current wife is permissible as long as she is virtuous and chaste in marriage.


As for your second question, the child in Islamic law must follow the Muslim among his or her parents, and it is the Muslim parent's right and responsibility to ensure his or her proper upbringing, guidance, and supervision.  Your statement that you would seek to expose your children to Islaam is a wise and judicious foresight.  And we hope that with the passing of time that they will be convinced of this religion and implement it in their lives.


No doubt that you will face some difficulty in convincing your wife to raise your children in the Islamic religion considering the promise you have made to her.  However, the use of wisdom and gentle judgment will aid you, God willing, in overcoming this difficulty.  This is important especially considering that it is expected that you will exert a concentrated effort in inviting your wife to Islam, since if she accepts it, the problem will be solved from its roots.


In any case, and no matter what the results, the first step towards success will be your accepting the religion of Islaam yourself.  We pray to God (Allaah) the Almighty and Magnificent that He eases your affairs and brings you success in finding the path of truth and that he guides your entire famliy to Islam.


I would be more than happy to dicuss any other questions or concerns you may have.
Salaam.  Peace."

Are a men and women allowed to have sex on their wedding night?
If so, how often are the husband and the wife allowed to have intercourse; once a week and so on?",There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate how often the husband and wife make love because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences.,"Praise be to Allah.How often husband and wife make love
Yes, the couple can have intercourse on the first night of their marriage if they want to. There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate the number of times a couple may or should have intercourse, because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences. 
As long as people vary in their abilities, it is not possible for the Shari`ah to impose a specific number in such cases. But intercourse is the right of the wife and is a duty on the husband . 
Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Intercourse is a duty on the man – i.e., the husband should have intercourse with his wife – so long as he has no excuse. This is also the opinion of Malik.” (al-Mughni, 7/30)
Imam al-Bukhari reported from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘O ‘Abd-Allah, have I not heard that you fast all day and stand all night in prayer?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Do not do that. Fast and break your fast, stand in prayer and sleep. For your body has rights over you, your eyes have rights over you, and your wife has rights over you.’” In the commentary on this hadith, it says: “The husband should not exhaust himself in worship to the extent that he becomes too weak to fulfil her rights by having intercourse with her and by earning a living.” (Fath al-Bari)
It is also the wife’s right that her husband should spend his nights with her. Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali said: “If he has a wife, he should spend one night in four with her, so long as he has no excuse.” (Al-Mughni, 7/28; Kashf al-Qina’, 3/144).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“It is obligatory for the husband to have intercourse with his wife as much as is needed to satisfy her, so long as this does not exhaust him physically or keep him away from earning a living… If they dispute over this matter, the judge should prescribe more in the way of intercourse just as he may prescribe more in the way of spending.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah min Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 246)
The Shari`ah also requires that a wife be protected from immorality by means of her husband having intercourse with her, as much as is needed to satisfy her and to provide this protection. But there is no way that this can be stated in terms of a specific period of time, such as four months, or more, or less. It should be defined according to the wife’s needs and her husband’s ability to fulfil her rights… All of this applies in normal circumstances, when the husband is present and living with his wife.
If the husband is absent from his wife because he is travelling for a legitimate purpose or other legitimate excuse, in this case the husband should try not to be absent from his wife for too long.
If he is absent because he is doing something for the benefit of the Muslims as a whole, such as participating in jihad for the sake of Allah or patrolling the borders of Islam, he should be permitted to go back to his family once every four months or less, so that he can spend time with them before returning to his duties in jihad or border patrol. This was the policy of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who stipulated that soldiers and members of the border patrol should be absent from their wives for only four months, after which time they should be brought back and others sent to take their place…” (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah by Zaydan, 7/239)

A man was writing on a piece of paper, and whilst he was writing he made a mistake with some of the words. He got very upset, and because he was so angry he cursed the pen and paper [the Arabic wording states that he “cursed the religion and the heaven of the pen and paper” – Translator]]. Is cursing [the religion and the heaven of] the pen or paper or rock or tree or chair or whatever considered to be Kufr (disbelief)?",,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly this kind of cursing is haram (impermissible). Even if we say that the pen and paper have no religion in the sense of doing acts of worship, nevertheless the religion is one, and it is Allah Who has subjugated these pens and other tools and made it easy for us to use them, so there is the fear that this cursing may be referred back to Allah. So this person has to repent and seek forgiveness, and not do anything like this again.

                I am very interested in Islam. I have since 1994 started to read the Qur'an and the Prophets Hadiths (pbuh)since early this year and I have found great spiritual fulfillment in Islam. I will (Insha Allah) soon be receiving Namaaz lessons as I plan on embracing Islam. I am not sure of the meaning of a particular verse in the Qur'an from Surah Ya-Sin and I hope that you can be of help.
And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk (36:39)
I will appreciate your help. May Allah guide, protect and bless you for all the help you have given to so many people across the world by answering our questions and ending our dilemmas.",,"Praise be to Allah.

First of all, let me congratulate you for reaching a conviction that Islam is true and that it is the only religion which meets the needs of mans soul and fills it with tranquillity and joy. From the way in which you phrased your question, it is clear that what you have read about Islam has had an effect on you, so much so that if you had not stated that you are Hindu, we would have thought you were Muslim.

The most important thing I want to say to you is to advise you to hasten to enter Islam, and do it sooner rather than later. Once a person is convinced of the truth, what reason is there to delay embracing Islam?

There is another point which also needs to made clear. Some of those who want to enter Islam delay doing so until they have learnt some practical aspects of this faith, such as how to pray and so on, because they think that they are not fit to enter the religion until they have learnt some of its teachings. This is not correct; once the truth is clear to a person, it is his duty to follow it and enter Islam straight away. Then he can learn about the Quran and Sunnah and broaden his understanding of Islam. The Muslim is required to take learning and practice step by step, as much as he is able to, because no one knows when he or she will die. If a person meets Allaah (dies) with a religion other than Islaam, he will be one of the doomed. Furthermore, a person will not be rewarded and no hasanaat will be recorded for him until after he has entered Islaam, so he will lose a lot of benefits if he delays his Islaam; time wasted can never be recovered.

Now let us go back to your question, which has to do with the thirty-ninth aayah of Soorah Yaa-Seen.

In this aayah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse)"" [Yaa-Seen 36:39], i.e., We have made it progress through stages by which the passing of months can be measured, just as night and day are known from the sun.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
""They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage . . ."" [al-Baqarah 2:189]
""It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light , and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of their years and the reckoning. . ."" [Yoonus 10:5]

Allaah has given the sun its own light and has given the moon a (reflection) of light, and has made their courses different, so that the sun rises every day and sets at the end of of the day with one unchanging kind of light, but the positions of its rising and setting vary from summer to winter, because of which the days may be long and the nights short, then the days become short and the nights long. The sun is dominant in the day, so it is the heavenly body of the daytime.

As for the moon, Allaah has measured for it mansions or stages, so that on the first night of the month it rises as a faint crescent, giving little light, then its light increases in stages and its position gets higher each night. Every time its position is higher, it has more light, even though it is a reflection of the suns light, until its light becomes complete, on the fourteenth of the month, when it is a full moon. Then it starts to decrease until, at the end of the month, it ""returns like the old dried curved date stalk""

Ibn Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: ""This is the stalk of a bunch of dates."" Mujaahid said: ""It is a dried stalk."" Ibn Abbaas meant: the stalk of a bunch of dates when it becomes old, dry and bent. (Reference: Tafsir Ibn Katheer).

This likening of the moon at the end of the month to an old dried curved date stalk is a beautiful example of eloquence, by choosing a simile from the environment of the first listeners.

And Allaah knows best."
352,1087,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1087,Ruling on saying ‘I am a Salafi’,"Question

I have come to know a person who follows the Salafi da’wah and I have read a book about this movement. I believe that the Salafi da’wah is correct and that those who follow it have the sound ‘aqeedah (belief), but there are some matters I want to ask about.
How correct is it from an Islamic point of view to use the word “Salafi” and to describe oneself in this way?
If a person says that he is a Salafi, is he praising himself? Is this considered to be dividing the ummah?
If we tell the Sufis that their madhhab is not correct, and that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions taught it, they will respond that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions did not use the word “Salafi” either, so how should we reply to them?","Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). For more about saying ‘I am a Salafi’, see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah?
We can answer this question with the following points:
Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the mushrikeen (polytheists… those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah).” [Yusuf 12:108]
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the oath he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination!” [al-Nisa 4:115]
Who are the Salaf? 
Whoever follows the way of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) belongs to the salaf al-salih , even if the people call him something else; by the same token, whoever goes against it and deviates from the Sunnah is an innovator, even if he claims to be a Salafi.
Can you say ‘I am a Salafi’?
If a person calls himself a Salafi to express his gratitude for having been guided to this way, or to clearly distinguish himself from innovation, then this is OK and is allowed in Islam. But if he says it only for the purpose of praising himself, then this is not allowed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… therefore justify not yourselves…” [al-Najm 53:32]. 
Similarly, it is not allowed if it is said in a spirit of tribalism or sectarianism, because such attitudes are forbidden, as is clear from the following story: Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: “A man from the Muhajireen shoved a man from the Ansar from behind, so each man’s people gathered around him, saying ‘O Muhajireen (come and help)!’ or ‘O Ansar (come and help)!’ News of this reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said, ‘Stop this, for it is repulsive.’ Then he said, ‘What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah? What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah?’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 14105; the hadeeth is also to be found in al-Sahihayn).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it the call of the people of jahiliyyah and described it as repulsive, even though the words “Ansari” and “Muhajiri” are Islamic words, the first referring to those who supported Allah and His Messenger, and the second referring to those who left the land of kufr and migrated to Allah and His Messenger. Why were they described in this manner? Because in this instance, the words were not used in a permissible fashion; the usage was a sectarian and political one that could have led to fighting between the two groups. The same applies to the word “Salafi”.
If the Ahl al-Sunnah and the salaf draw a line between themselves and the innovators, this is not considered to be dividing the ummah, as those who criticize the use of this word think is the case, but this distancing of oneself has to be done in accordance with the degree of bid’ah – whether it is major or minor – and should be regulated by the overall interests of the Islamic da’wah.
Response to the Sufi claims
The Sufi claims mentioned in the question are not valid. The denunciation is not merely because of the word “Sufi”, which is a general word that may be applied to things approved of in Islam, such as asceticism (zuhd) and fear of Allah, or it may be applied to innovations such as monasticism and extremism. Rather the denunciation is because of the various types of shirk, major and minor, that are connected with Sufism and its tariqahs . 
The word Tasawwuf (Sufism) now refers to the Sufi tariqahs and the kinds of innovations they have. Sufism – as is obvious from their books and how Sufis actually are – includes deviant ideas of kufr, such as hulool (incarnation or the belief that the Creator may be indwelling in His creation – exalted be Allah above what they say), ittihad (union) and wahdat al-wujood (pantheism or the unity of existence, which is the belief that the Creator and His creation are the same thing, and that everything in existence is Allah – exalted be Allah above what they say), and going to extremes in what they say about the awliya, in addition to their innovations in the matter of acts of worship and awrad (du’as).
Your way to salvation
The one who is seeking salvation has to work hard to gain beneficial knowledge and do righteous deeds, and he should avoid vain arguments and futile discussions in which there is no benefit.
We ask Allah to help us and you to follow the truth and act upon it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

The Holy Qur'an, Surah 30: Al Rum 17 ""SO (GIVE) GLORY TO ALLAH, WHEN YE REACH EVENTIDE AND WHEN YE RISE IN THE MORNING;"" 18 ""YEA,TO HIM BE PRAISE, IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH; AND IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND WHEN THE DAY BEGINS TO DECLINE."" These verses only mention four prayers,but yet Muslims pray five times a day (plus Sunnah). Why does it not state the fifth prayer? PS. I'am a practicig Muslim (Inshallah) and I'am in no way trying to prove the Quran wrong.",,"Praise be to Allah.In the Tafseer of this aayah, it is reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The five daily prayers are (mentioned) in the Quran.” He was asked, “Where?” He said, “Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So glorify Allah when you come up to the evening’ is maghrib and ‘isha’; ‘and when you enter the morning’ is fajr; ‘in the afternoon’ is ‘asr; and ‘the time when the day begins to decline’ is zuhr.” Other mufassireen, such as al-Dahhaak and Sa’eed ibn Jubayr said the same thing. 
Some of the mufassireen said that these aayat mention only four of the prayers; ‘isha’ is not mentioned here, but it is mentioned in Soorat Hood, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and in some hours of the night…” [Hood 11:114] 
Most of the mufassireen are of the first opinion. Al-Nahhaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars of Tafseer say that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So glorify Allah when you come up to the evening and when you enter the morning…’ [al-Room 30:17] refers to the prayers.” 
Imaam al-Jassaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… The prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times [mawqootan].’ [al-Nisa’ 4:103]. It was reported that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: ‘[Mawqootan means that] Salaah has an appointed time just as Hajj does.’ It was reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid and ‘Atiyyah said [that mawqootan means] ‘It is obligatory’… The word ‘mawqootan’ means that it is obligatory at certain times. The times are referred to in general terms in this aayah and are explained elsewhere in the Book, without defining precisely when those times start and end – that was explained in detail by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  What Allah mentioned about the times of the prayers in His Book is (interpretation of the meaning): “Perform al-Salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night and recite the Quran in the early dawn…” [al-Isra’ 17:78]. Mujaahid reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “’Mid-day’ means when the sun has passed its zenith for salaat al-zuhr, and ‘the darkness of the night’ means the beginning of the night, for salaat al-maghrib.” It was also reported from Ibn ‘Umar that mid-day meant the zenith…  Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night” [Hood 11:114]. ‘Amr reported from al-Hasan that ‘the two ends of the day’ means fajr at the first end and zuhr and ‘asr at the other; ‘some parts of the night’ means maghrib and ‘isha’. So according to this opinion the aayah refers to all five prayers….  Layth reported from al-Hakam from Abu ‘Ayyaad that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “This aayah mentions all five prayers together. ‘So glorify Allah when you come up to the evening’ refers to maghrib and ‘isha’, ‘and when you enter the morning’ refers to fajr, ‘in the afternoon’ is ‘asr; and ‘the time when the day begins to decline’ is zuhr.” Something similar was also reported from al-Hasan. 
Abu Razeen reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “ ‘…and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting’ [Qaaf 50:39 – interpretation of the meaning] refers to the prescribed prayers. ‘… and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and during some of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day, that you may become pleased with the reward which Allah shall give you.’ [Ta-Ha 20:130 – interpretation of the meaning] This aayah also includes the times of the prayers. All of these aayaat mention the times of the prayers.” 
Ahkaam al-Quran by al-Jassaas, Baab Mawaaqeet al-Salaah. 
What you should also know is that the Quran does not contain details of all the rules. The Quran mentions many rules, but it also tells us that the Sunnah is a source of evidence in which many rules are mentioned in detail that are not mentioned in the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… and We have also sent down to you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them and that they may give thought.” [al-Nahl 16:44]
“… and whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it…” [al-Hashr 59:7]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Quran and something like it with it…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16546; this is a saheeh hadeeth). Whether the rules were narrated in the Quran or in the Sunnah, all of it is true and right, and all of it has one source, which is the wahy or revelation from the Lord of the Worlds."

                I am speaking under correction. Please do correct me if I don't have my facts right:
According to The Bible there is no country such as Israel, only Palestine. The Jew and the Arab, both stemming from Abraham is in fact half brothers. So why can they not live in harmony in a new country called Palestine?",,"Praise be to Allah.Your question may be answered by the following points:


There is no doubt that the Prophet of Allaah Ibraaheem (Abraham) was a pure monotheist, and he was not among the polytheists and disbelievers. Although the Jews are among the offspring of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), they went against his way by associating partners in worship with Allaah and claiming that Uzayr (Ezra) was a son of God. They said that God is miserly and that His hand is tied up, and they said, He is poor and we are rich. They also said that when God created the heavens and the earth in six days, He got tired, so He rested on the Sabbath day exalted be Allaah far above all that they say about Him. They also likened the attributes of God to human attributes (anthropomorphism) and killed the Prophets, etc., etc.


Once this distinction and contrast is made clear, there can be no brotherhood between a monotheistic believer and a polytheistic disbeliever, as Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever, - until you believe in Allaah Alone, except the saying of Ibraaheem to his father: Verily, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allaah) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allaah. Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return, - Certainly, there has been in them an excellent example for you to follow, - for those who look forward to (the Meeting with) Allaah (for the reward from Him) and the Last Day. And whosoever turn away, then verily, Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all Praise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:4,6]


Once this separation and enmity is clear, it is unavoidable that there will be hostility and disavowal and the resulting struggle against the enemies of Allaah. So long as the laws and wisdom of Allaah dictate that there should the distinction between believers and disbelievers, there has to be this clearly-stated enmity. There can be no change to the laws of Allaah.
There cannot be harmony between Jews who are usurpers and aggressors, who have oppressed and persecuted others, and who are known for their treachery and corruption throughout the world, historically and in the present age and the purely monotheistic Muslim owners of the land, whose menfolk the Jews have killed, and imprisoned their sons, and destroyed their homes, and taken possession of their lands by force, and prevented them from earning a proper living, and carried out chemical and radiational experiments on their prisoners, and taken organs from them for transplant into Jewish patients and all other kinds of persecutions and atrocities.
In addition to this, the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal; it is not possible to trust them at all. Their current conduct bears this out: is there any treaty or agreement signed by them that they have actually fulfilled? This is no big surprise for the Muslims, who know what Allaah has said in His Book about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside? Nay! The truth is most of them believe not. [al-Baqarah 2:100].
Moreover, if the Muslims agreed to live in peace with the Jews, who would be in charge? One of the basic principles of Islam is that Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. One of the conditions for People of the Book (Jews and Christians) living with Muslims in a Muslim country is that they should live under certain conditions (shuroot ahl al-dhimmah) in return for the security and protection afforded them by the Muslims. One of the most important of these conditions is that they should not openly display their shirk and kufr (polytheistic disbelief) in the Muslim lands, whether by word or deed.
As the Muslims and Jews are enemies residing in opposing religious and doctrinal camps, it is not possible for them to be brought together unless one is made to submit to the other by force. Indeed, the Jews now are not allowing the Muslims to remain in their homes, even if there was no provocative action on the part of the Muslims; they are seizing the Muslims property by force, building their settlements on the Muslims lands and expelling the Muslims by any means. They have expelled millions to the neighbouring countries, which have accommodated them in the so-called Palestinian refugee camps.
Finally, although the Muslims nowadays are in a position of weakness and humiliation because they have turned away from their religion and are unable to fight the Jews, take back their stolen lands and impose the rule of Islamic shareeah in Palestine, this does not mean that this will always be the case until the end of the world. Things have to change, and one of the indications of this is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who informed us of some things that are to happen in the future. He was supported by Revelation from his Lord; he did not speak of his own whims and desires, but of that which was revealed to him. He said:
You will fight the Jews and will prevail over them, so that a rock will say, O Muslim! There is Jew behind me, kill him!
(Reported by Muslim, 2921; al-Bukhaari, 2926).
According to a report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Hour [the Day of Judgement] will not begin until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. A Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him! except for the gharqad (box thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.
(Reported by Muslim, 2922).
We would like to express our appreciation for your question, your desire to find out the truth, and the polite and eloquent manner in which your inquiry was phrased. We invite you to believe in Allaah as your Lord, in Islam as your religion, and in Muhammad as your Prophet, for this by Allaah will save you and benefit you and protect you in this world, in the grave after death, and in the Hereafter on the Day of Reckoning.

Please accept my apology if this questions offends, but in the pursuit of Islamic knowledge, we cannot afford to be shy for fear that if we are not well advised, we may commit a sin.
I have been advised by a friend that there is a ""qawl"" (opinion) among some ulamaa' (scholars) that it is permissible to conduct anal sex (anal penetration) (between man and wife only) during the time of the wife's haydh (menstruation).
Is this correct?
Please also advise the laws and penalties relevant to it.",,"Praise be to Allah. 

Your apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary.

As regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: ""Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865).

The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: ""The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918).

In spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born.

Another reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah.

It is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal.

I ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers."
359,1106,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1106,Differences in Prayer for Men and Women,"Question

                Is there any prove from the Sunnah or ijtihad of the Sahaba that the praying (salat) 
of a woman is on some points different from the man, like it is in the Hanafi 
madhhab?",,"Praise be to Allah.
  The general principle is that women are equal to men in all religious rulings, 
  because of the hadeeth ""Women are the twin halves of men"" (Reported 
  by Imaam Ahmad and classified as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami’ 1983), except 
  when there is evidence (daleel) of a specific ruling which applies only to women. 
  One of the cases in which the scholars mention specific rules for women is prayer, 
  where there are differences as follows:
Women do not have to give adhaan or iqaamah, 
    because adhaan requires raising the voice, which women are not permitted to 
    do. Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""We know of no 
    difference between the scholars (on this point)."" (Al-Mughni 
    ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/438). 
All of the woman’s body is ‘awrah 
    and must be covered during prayer, except for her face, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ""No prayer will be accepted from an adult woman unless she wears a khimaar 
    (head-cover). (Reported by the five Muhadditheen) 
    There is some dispute as to whether her heels and feet should be covered. 
    The author of al-Mughni (2/328) said: ""As for the rest of the free woman’s 
    body, it must be covered during prayer. If any part becomes uncovered, it 
    renders her prayer invalid, except if only a little bit is uncovered. Maalik, 
    al-Oozaa’i and al-Shaafi’i said the same.
The woman should keep her limbs close 
    to her body during rukoo’ and sujood, and not spread them out, because 
    this is more modest and covering. (Al-Mughni 2/258). Al-Nawawi 
    said: ""Al-Shaafi’i said, in al-Mukhtasar: there is no difference 
    between men and women in prayer, except that women should keep the parts of 
    their bodies close to one another, and they should make their stomachs touch 
    their thighs during sujood. This is more covering and preferable, in rukoo’ 
    and the rest of the prayer too."" (See al-Majmoo’ 
    3/429).
It is preferable for women to pray in 
    congregation, led by one of their number, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Umm Waraqah to lead the women 
    of her household in prayer. There is some difference among scholars on this 
    matter. (See al-Mughni, 2/202 and al-Majmoo’ al-Nawawi, 
    4/84-85). The woman leading the prayer should read aloud 
    as long as no non-mahram man can hear her.
It is permissible for women to go out 
    and pray in the mosque with men, although their prayer at home is better for 
    them, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Do not prevent the women from going out 
    to the mosques, even though their homes are better for them."" (For 
    more details on this matter, see Question#973).
Imaam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy 
    on him, said (al-Majmoo’ 3/455): 
    ""Women differ from men in congregational prayer in a number of ways:
(1) Congregational prayer is not required 
    of them in the same way as it is of men.
    (2) The imam of a group of women stands in the middle of the (first) row.
    (3) (If one woman and one man are praying), she should stand behind him, not 
    next to him.
    (4) If women are praying in rows behind men, the back rows are better for 
    them than the front rows.
What we can learn from the above is that 
  women and men are forbidden to mix. Allaah is our Helper and Support."
360,1107,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1107,Ruling on watching    movies based on shirk beliefs or predictions of the future,"Question

Is it halal for a Muslim to watch a film such as Hercules which is based on Shirk stories/ideas?
I eagerly await your response insha'Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to watch these kinds of movies which tell stories of shirk. Seeing and hearing them can cause serious damage to the heart of the Muslim. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got angry with Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) when he saw him with a piece of the Tawraat (Torah) in his hand, and told him to destroy it. Many of the Muslims do not have sufficient protection or the level of knowledge required to recognize the corrupt ideas in these movies, so some viewers may develop doubts that damage their eemaan and shake their belief; they may start to believe some of the false ideas and their hearts may be filled with evil poisons as a result of watching these movies. This is in addition to the haraam content in many of these movies, such as pictures of women, music and so on. We may also note the recent appearance of movies based on distorted Biblical beliefs or the false prophecies of liars and charlatans. These movies have become very popular in the West because of the spiritual vacuum resulting from the lack of true religion. Due to the environment surrounding the Muslims in western countries, some of them have started to follow these movies. Muslims should fear their Lord and avoid watching these films of kufr. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily! The hearing, and the sight, of each of those you will be questioned by Allah. [Al-Isra 17:36]
If Muslims want to entertain themselves, let them do so in permissible ways. And Allah is the guide to the Straight Path."
361,1108,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1108,The Unlettered Prophet,"Question

                Is there any evidence that the Prophet Muhammad was unable to read or write?",,"Praise be to Allah.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful al-Tayyibaat (i.e., all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful al-khabaa’ith (i.e., all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah’s Covenant) and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honor him, help him and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.""
[al-A’raaf 7:157]

Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: ""Allaah says ‘al-ummi.’ Ibn ‘Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: ‘Your Prophet was unlettered, unable to read or write or calculate.’ Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’an), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . .’
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:48].""

Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the second aayah quoted [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48]:
""Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’aan), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . .’ i.e., ‘you (O Muhammad) lived among your people for a while before you brought this Qur’aan to them, and you never read any book or were able to write anything. Everyone among your people and others knows that you are an unlettered man, who does not read or write.’ This is how he was described in the previous Books as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden) . . .’ [al-A’raaf 7:157].

Hence the Prophet will remain unable to write even one line or one letter, until the Day of Resurrection. He had scribes who would write down in front of him the Revelation and letters to different regions. . . . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘. . . In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted.’ [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48], i.e., if you had been good at it (reading and writing), some of the ignorant people would have doubted you and said that you had learnt this from the previous Books left by the Prophets. Indeed, they say this despite the fact that they know he was unlettered and unable to write, as it says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And they say: ""Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.""’ [al-Furqaan 25:5]""

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

""He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book and al-Hikmah (al-Sunnah). And verily, they had been before in manifest error.""
[al-Jumu’ah 62:2]

Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:
""It was said: ‘the unlettered ones’ means those who do not write. Such were the Quraysh. Mansoor reported from Ibraaheem, who said: ‘Al-ummi (the unlettered one) is the one who neither reads nor writes. ""A Messenger from among themselves"" means Muhammad , who was unlettered and never read a book nor learned how.’ Al-Mawardi said: ‘What is good about the fact that Allaah sent an unlettered Prophet? There are three things:
(i) his message fulfilled the foretelling of the previous Prophets;
(ii) this made him similar to and closer to other Prophets (illiterates);
(iii) this would eliminate all suspicion that he had learned the message he preached from books and writings that he had read.""

I say: all of this is evidence of the miraculous nature and truth of his Prophethood.

(The above has been summarized from the Tafseer of al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him)."

I am deeply in love with a Muslim man and want to marry him. I know that Allah forbids girlfriend-boyfriend relationships, and feel very sorry in my heart for our relationship. I feel that because we have been in this relationship which is abhorred by Allah, he will never marry me because he has lost respect for me. What does the Quran say about having a girlfriend or a boyfriend?","It is haram for a man to have a girlfriend and it is haram for a woman to have a boyfriend. The evil consequences and misery caused by such relationships are obvious to anyone who observes real life. For more, see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends…” [al-Nisa 4:25]
In his commentary on this ayah, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Muhsanat [translated as “chaste”] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zina (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musafihat , which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them. 
Regarding the phrase wa la muttakhidhati akhdan (‘nor taking boyfriends’), Ibn 'Abbas said: ‘al-musafihat means those who are known to commit zina, meaning those who will not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them.’ Ibn 'Abbas also said: ‘muttakhidhati akhdan means lovers.’ A similar interpretation was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, al-Sha’bi, al-Dahhak, ‘Ata al-Khurasani, Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, Muqatil ibn Hayyan and al-Saddi. They said: (it means) lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: ‘It means a (male) friend.’ Al-Dahhak also said: ‘wa la muttakhidhati akhdan also means a woman who has just one boyfriend or lover with whom she is happy. Allah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation…’”
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Made lawful to you this day are al-tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) foods…]. The food of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other articles of Faith, then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.” [al-Maidah 5:5]
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Muhsineen ghayr musafiheen wa la muttakhidhi akhdan (‘desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends’ ). Just as Allah imposed the condition of chastity on women, meaning that they refrain from zina, so it is also imposed on men. The man must also be pure and chaste. So they should be ghayr musafiheen, meaning they should not be adulterers who do not refrain from sin and do not refuse any who come to them (for immoral purposes). Nor should they be muttakhidhi akhdan, meaning those who have girlfriends or female lovers with whom they have an exclusive relationship, as quoted above from Surat al-Nisa. (The one with many lovers or the one with just one lover) are both the same. For this reason Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is not right to marry a promiscuous woman unless she has repented, or to arrange a marriage of such a woman to a chaste man, so long as she is still conducting herself in this manner. Similarly, he (Ahmad) says that it is not right for a promiscuous man to marry a chaste woman unless he repents and gives up his immoral conduct, because of this ayah… We will discuss this matter in further detail after quoting the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Nur 24:3]
The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends
Among the stories that show that it is forbidden to have girlfriends or to marry them is the story of Marthad ibn Abi Marthad, who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah to Madinah. There was a prostitute in Makkah, called ‘Anaq, who had been a friend of Marthad’s. Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madinah. He said: “I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then ‘Anaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: ‘Marthad?’ I said, ‘Marthad.’ She said: ‘Welcome! Stay with us tonight.’ I said, ‘O ‘Anaq, Allah has forbidden zina (unlawful sexual relations)’ … I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I marry ‘Anaq?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent and did not answer me at all, until the ayah ‘Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman; to the believers such a thing is forbidden’ [al-Nur 24:3 – Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation] was revealed. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘O Marthad, Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman, so do not marry her.’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3101; he said: it is a hasan gharib hadith).
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mughaffal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: “Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam.” So he left her alone and went away, still looking at her, until he walked into a wall, hitting his face. He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You are a man for whom Allah wishes good. When Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, wishes good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for his sin, so that it is dealt with before the Day of Resurrection.” (Reported by al-Hakim, 1/349, who said this hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. See Sahih al-Jami’, 308).
The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam
These ayat and ahadith clearly indicate that it is haram (forbidden) for men to have any kind of friendship or relationship with non-mahram women (women to whom they are not closely-related and to whom they could get married). 
The evil consequences and misery caused by such relationships are obvious to anyone who observes real life. A similar question has been asked under #2085 . 
We ask Allah to keep us far away from that which is forbidden, to protect us from all that may earn His wrath and to keep us safe from a painful punishment. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

I see many ""Muslims"" joining in Christmas and other celebrations. Is there any evidence from the Quran and Sunnah that I can present to them to show that these are indeed very sinful practices?",It is not permissible to join in the non-Muslim festivals because this entails imitating or resembling them and taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them.,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to join in the non-Muslim festivals for the following reasons: 

Firstly: because this entails imitating or resembling them , and “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud). This is a serious warning. `Abdullah ibn Al-`Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever lives in the land of the disbelievers and celebrates their Nowruz (New Year) and their Mahrajan (festivals), and imitates them until he dies, he will be a loser on the Day of Resurrection. 
Secondly: taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliya’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them…”  [Al-Ma’idah 5:51]
“O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them.” [Al-Mumtahanah 60:1] 

Thirdly: festivals are matters that are related to religion and beliefs and not to worldly customs, as is indicated by the Hadith: “Every nation has its Eid, and this is our `Eid.” Their `Eid or festival reflects their corrupt disbelief and polytheism. 
Fourthly: “And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass it by with dignity.” [Al-Furqan 25:72 – interpretation of the  meaning] The scholars interpreted this verse was referring to the festivals of the non-Muslims. It is not permissible to give any of them cards for their festivals , or to sell them cards or any of the other things they need for their festivals such as lights, trees or food – including turkey, candy canes, etc.

In Paradise will the servants of Allah remember the Previous world, and therefore, be able to desire Things that they desired on earth?",,"Praise be to Allah.There is evidence in the Quran that the people of Paradise will remember the life of this world. For example, in Soorat al-Toor, Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning):
""And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with our families (of the punishment of Allah). But Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."" [al-Toor 52:25-28]
They will also remember the evil people who tried to make the people of faith have doubts and called them to kufr. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. A speaker of them will say, ‘Verily, I had a companion (in the world), who used to say, ""Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death), (that) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?"" [al-Saffaat 37:50-53]
They will remember the trials and tribulations they went though in this world, with regard to themselves, their children, their families and their wealth, and they will say joyfully: ""… ‘All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).’"" [Faatir 35:34]
They will also be reminded of this life when they see the fruits which will resemble those which they used to eat in this world, but whose size and taste are different. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""… Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: ‘This is what we were provided with before,’ and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e., in the same form but different in taste)…"" [al-Baqarah 2:25]
They will also recall their du’aa’s in times of hardship, when they raised their hands to heaven asking for their deeds to be accepted and for help to do righteous deeds and to be included among those who would inherit blessings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with out families (of the punishment of Allah). But Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."" [al-Toor 52:25-28]
As regards the matter of them desiring something like the blessings of this world, they will in fact desire something better than that, because even the person who is the lowest in status in Paradise will enjoy something like ten times the joys of this world. ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said: ""The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ‘I know who will be the last person to be brought out of Hell and the last person to enter Paradise. It will be a man who will come out of Hell crawling. Allah will say to him, ""Go and enter Paradise."" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, ""O Lord, I found it full."" Allah will say to him a second time, ""Go and enter Paradise."" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, ""O Lord, I found it full."" Allah will say to him, ""Go and enter Paradise, for there you will have something like the world and ten times more."" The man will say, ""Are You making fun of me (or are You laughing at me), and You are the King of all?""’ - and I saw the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) smiling so broadly that his back teeth could be seen. He used to say, ‘That is the person who is lowest in status in Paradise.’"" [Agreed upon; this version is reported by Muslim, no. 272]
Everything that the people of Paradise desire will be theirs, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""… (there will be) therein all that one’s inner-self could desire, all that the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever."" [al-Zukhruf 43:71]
A number of ahaadeeth state that the people of Paradise will have their desires for children or to grow things fulfilled, without having to wait for them.
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was speaking about the people of Paradise one day when a Bedouin was present. He described how a man of the people of Paradise will ask his Lord’s permission to grow some plants. (In Arabic, the past tense is used here to show that this will undoubtedly happen). Allah will ask him, ""Do you not already have all that you want?"" He will say, ""Yes, but I like to grow things."" So he will go and plant his seeds, and within the blinking of an eye they will grow, ripen, be harvested and piled up like mountains. Allah will say, ""Here you are, O son of Adam, nothing makes you satisfied!"" The Bedouin said, ""O Messenger of Allah, you will find that he is either from Quraysh or the Ansaar, for they are the ones who like to grow things; we don’t like to grow anything!"" The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) smiled broadly. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6965).
Ibn Hijr reported the following hadeeth in Fath al-Baari; from it we learn that whatever worldly desires one wishes for in Paradise can be fulfilled.
Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2487. Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6649)
We ask Allah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy.
And Allah knows best."

    zakaah to a Raafidi","Question

                What is the ruling on giving the zakaah
      of the Sunnis to the Raafidi (Shi’ah) poor? If a Muslim who is obliged to pay zakaah
      gives it to a poor Raafidi, has he discharged his responsibility or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.In the chapters of their books which discuss who is
    entitled to receive zakaah funds, the scholars have stated that these funds are not to be
    given to a kaafir or an innovator (follower of bid’ah). The Raafidis are undoubtedly
    kuffaar for four reasons:
They cast aspersions on the Qur’aan, claiming that two-thirds of it
        has been omitted, as is stated in their book by al-Noori which is called Fasl
        al-Khitaab fi Ithbaat Tahreef Kitaab Rabb al-Arbaab, and in Al-Kaafi, and other
        books. Whoever casts aspersions on the Qur’aan is a kaafir who disbelieves in the
        words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “and surely, We will guard it
        (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]

They cast aspersions upon the Sunnah and the saheeh ahaadeeth. They do
        not follow them, because they were narrated from the Sahaabah who, according to them, are
        kuffaar. They believe that the Sahaabah became kaafirs after the Prophet 
 (peace and
        blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, apart from ‘Ali and his descendents, Salmaan,
        ‘Ammaar and a few others. But with regard to the first three khaleefahs and the
        majority of the Sahaabah who gave their bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to them,
        they think that they all apostatized and became kaafirs, so their ahaadeeth cannot be
        accepted. This is stated in al-Kaafi and other books of theirs.

They regard the Sunnis (Ahl al-Sunnah) as kaafirs, so they do not
        pray with you. Whoever prays behind a Sunni will repeat his prayer. Indeed, they think
        that we are naajis (impure), and when they shake hands with us they go and wash
        their hands. Whoever regards the Muslims as kaafirs is himself a kaafir, so we regard them
        as kaafirs just as they regard us as kaafirs, and more so.

They commit clear shirk in their exaggerations about ‘Ali
        and his descendents and in their calling upon them alongside Allaah. This is stated
        clearly in their books, where they exaggerate about them and describe them in terms that
        are befitting only for the Lord of the Worlds. We have heard this in their tapes. They do
        not participate in the charity work of the Ahl al-Sunnah, or give charity to the Sunni
        poor; if they do these things, it is with deeply rooted and hidden hatred, and they do
        that as a form of taqiyyah (dissimulation, calculated deception). On these grounds,
        anyone who has given zakaah to them must pay his zakaah again, because he has given it to
        someone who will be helped in his kufr and to wage war against the Sunnah thereby. Whoever
        is obliged to pay zakaah is forbidden to give it to a Raafidi; if he does this, he has not
        discharged his obligation and he has to pay it again because he did not give the money
        with which he had been entrusted to the people who were entitled to receive it. Whoever
        doubts this, let him read the books that have been written in refutation of them, such as
        the book by al-Qifaari which refutes their way, and al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah by
        al-Khateeb, and the books of Ehsan Ilahi Zaheer, and others. And Allaah is the Source of
        Strength. [Note: al-Khutoot al’Areedah and the books of Ehsan Ilahi

I am a young man from Denmark, who for some time have been interested in Islam. I have now reached a point where I am absolutely sure that I want to become a Muslim. My questions are as follows:
- Since I would have to be circumcised to become Muslim (this I gladly accepts) I would like to know how this comes about. Is it done by a doctor, an imam or by oneself?
- I feel changing my name as I become Muslim is a truly happy occasion. But I would like to now which of the following names you find to be most suitable as my new first name?

Qasim
Aasim
Taymullah
or Sayyid


I will be very grateful indeed to get a response to my letter.
Sincerely",,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allah,
All Praise is due to Allah for having guided you to this path which you would not have been guided to without Allaahs Guidance. Your interest in embracing our religion is very pleasant news for us tonight. We pray to Allaah that you successfully embrace Islam and become steadfast on it.
As for your first question, if circumcision does not cause you harm, you can have it performed by a surgeon whos experience and skill you trust. If it would cause you harm, then you dont have to do it and that will not adversely affect your Islam, InShaa'a Allah (Allah Willing).
As for changing your name, note that the most beloved names to Allah are: Abdul-llah (The Slave/worshipper of Allah) and Abdul-Rahman (The Slave/worshipper of the Most Merciful one of the names of Allah). This came to us in the authentic Hadeeth (sayings) of the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) which was narrated by Muslim (hadeeth number 3975).
If you want us to choose one of the names that you have listed, you can use Aasim which means: protector preserver defender guarder.
We pray to Allaah for you to have a Blissful and Pleasant life in the shadow of the Great Islam."

                When does a woman in labour (for childbirth) stop performing the salah? Does she still perform the salah if she is having contractions but no fluid has come from her body yet?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh
    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him:
If a woman whose pregnancy has reached full term passes blood
    and has pains, but she does not know whether these are the contractions that will lead to
    childbirth or contractions that will later ease off [“practice” contractions,
    also known as Braxton-Hicks contractions], should she pray or not?
He answered, may Allaah preserve him:
Of course, there are two things we may assume here: 
The first is that the pregnancy will continue without
    contractions.
The second is that the apparent case is that these are
    contractions, so she should stop praying.
If this is what usually happens to her, and she may carry on
    having contractions for four or five days without giving birth, then in this case she
    should still pray.
Question:
If she acts upon the second assumption, then the contractions
    ease off, should we tell her to make up the prayers she has missed?
Answer:
It is preferable to make them up, because she took her
    decision on the basis of an assumption.
In summary, then:
If this woman usually has contractions for a number of days
    – more than two or three – then this is not nifaas and she should pray. If that
    is not what usually happens, then we assume that it is nifaas in the sense that she should
    stop praying. If she stops praying, then it turns out that it was not nifaas, then in this
    case we say that if she makes up the prayers she has missed, this is good, and if she does
    not make them up, there is nothing wrong with that because she acted on an assumption.

The young is told to start praying when they are seven year old and they are to be punished for not performing prayer when they ten, according to Sunnah. Does the same rule apply for fasting?",,"Praise be to Allah.The young boy is ordered to fast when he reaches the age of 7 is if he is physically capable of bearing it. (Some Muslim scholars that he should be physically reprimanded if he does not fast by the age of 10, which is the same rule that is applied to prayer; refer to Al Mughni 3/90). The boy will get a reward for fasting and his parents will get a reward for teaching him well and guiding him to that which is good. Al Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwadh (may Allah be pleased with her) said about fasting ‘Aashouraa’ at the time when it was mandatory to fast it and not voluntary: we used to make our young boys fast, and we made them a toy made out of wool. If one of the boys cried [wanting] food, we would give him [the toy to distract him] until it was time to break the fast."" (Al Bukhari Fath # 1960). (Ashouraa is the tenth day of the month of Muharram. Although fasting this day is now voluntary the majority of Muslims usually fast.) Some people are quite lenient and lax when it comes to making their children fast. A situation may even arise where the young child feels enthusiastic and chooses to fast and is physically capable of doing so, then his father or mother order him to break his fast claiming that it is out of sympathy. Little do they know that real sympathy is in stressing the importance of fasting and teaching the child about it. Allah said in Surat ul-Tahreem (interpretation of the meaning): ""O you who believe! Ward yourselves and your families off from a fire (Hell) whose fuel is of men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who do not disobey the commands they receive from Allah, and execute that which they are commanded."" We must pay extra attention to the young girl when she first starts fasting after she reaches puberty. There is a possibility that she will fast while she has her period (the first time) out of shame or shyness, and end up not making up the days later on.

So, this means it is permissible to continue eating and drinking unless it is evident for one that it is 
time for Fajr. Fajr can be defined as the ‘white’ light spreading across the horizon from the 
eastern side. If one was unable to sight Al-Fajr and there was no one else who could tell him 
about it through means such as raising the Azaan (The call to prayers), then one should follow the

This is due to the limitations of their small size and its numbers. Is this permissible?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is rather unusual [in my opinion] to raise this kind of question. We ought to ask ourselves; is it really beyond our reach to have a large enough place, even if it were to be in a park, a stadium, etc., which would be sufficient to cater for the large number of praying people? How were our Muslim ancestors performing their Salaat-ul ‘Eed? Did not they perform it in an open place nearby their town, even though it might have been on a rainy or chilly day, which was the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, let us assume that the matter is neither due to laziness nor disorganisation, nor due to the fact that they are accustomed to performing Salaat in enclosed places and are not acclimated to performing it in open places. If all the aforementioned is true and the excuse is a valid one, the solution, as Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Ibn Baaz states, is to have numerous places where the Salaat can be performed, not through holding many congregations [at the same place]. This is because if they were to hold a second [or more] Salaat-ul ‘Eed then it would count as if one is performing a missed Salaat, not as performing a Salaat at its due time, even though the Imaam would be changed and the congregation is a different one.

                I know that we are supposed to let
  our beards grow in order to be different from the mushrikeen, but nowadays they let their
  beards grow too. What is your opinion?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is waajib (obligatory) to let the beard grow, and shaving it is
haraam (forbidden). Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others narrated from Ibn
‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) that the Prophet 
 (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Be different from the mushrikeen: let
your beards grow and trim your moutsaches.” Ahmad and Muslim reported from Abu
Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) said: “Cut your moustaches and let your beards grow: be different
from the Magians.” Persisting in shaving one’s beard is a major sin (kabeerah);
the one who does this should be advised against it, and his action should be denounced,
especially if he is in a position of religious leadership. 
The idea of being different from the Magians and other mushrikeen does
not mean being different from them in every single thing, particularly if they happen to
be doing something righteous or good in accordance with the fitrah (natural inclinations
of man). What is meant is that we should be different from them in matters where they have
gone astray and deviated from the truth and the dictates of the fitrah, and gone against
the way of the Prophets and Messengers by shaving their beards. We should differ from them
in this case by letting our beards grow and cutting our moustaches, following the guidance
of the Prophets and Messengers, and in accordance with the fitrah. It is proven that the
Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ten
things are part of the fitrah: cutting the moustache, letting the beard grow, cleaning the
teeth with a siwaak, rinsing the nose with water, cutting one’s nails, washing
between the finger-joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubic hair and cleaning
one’s private parts with water.” (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and the four
authors of Sunan, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased
with her). Even if the kaafiroon start letting their beards grow, this does
not mean that the Muslims are allowed to shave theirs, because as we have stated above,

                What is the ruling about women wearing
      wigs to appear attractive to their husbands?",,"Praise be to Allah.Both husband and wife should make themselves attractive to one another,
    in ways that the other likes, so as to strengthen their relationship, but this has to be
    within the limits of what is allowed in sharee’ah, not by doing things that are
    prohibited. The use of wigs started among non-Muslim women, who were so well known for
    wearing them and adorning themselves with them that this became one of their
    distinguishing features. If a woman wears a wig and adorns herself with it, even if she
    does this for her husband, she is imitating the kaafir women, which the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade: “Whoever imitates a people is
    one of them.” Wigs also come under the ruling about hair extensions, which is even
    more vehement in its prohibition: the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) forbade this practice and cursed the one who does it. Fataawa al-Lajnah
    al-Daa’imah, 5/191.
    Humayd ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf reported
    that he heard Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan at the time of Hajj, standing on the minbar
    and holding a piece of hair that had been seized by his guards, saying: “Where are
    your scholars? I heard the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) forbidding this kind of thing and saying that Bani Israa’eel were destroyed when
    their women started to use such things.” Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with
    him) reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Allaah has cursed the woman who adds false hair and the woman who has this done, and
    the woman who tattoos and the women who has this done.” (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 5477). And Allaah knows best."

400,1182,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1182,Ruling on enforced isolation of those who have AIDS and on those who deliberately infect others,"Question

We have recently seen the spread of AIDS, which has many repercussions on society. This raises a number of questions, such as whether the person who has AIDS should be forcibly isolated from people who do not have the disease. What is the ruling on a person who deliberately transmits the disease to others? Is the person who has this disease considered to be suffering a terminal illness, because this is a factor in matters of divorce and financial transactions?",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: isolation of the sick.
The medical information that is currently available states that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through living with a person or touching him; it is not airborne; it is not transmitted through insects or through sharing food, drink, swimming pools, seats, eating utensils, and whatever else has to do with the ordinary details of living together day by day. The disease is primarily transferred in one of the following ways:

Sexual contact, of whatever kind.
Transfusion of infected blood or blood products.
Using infected needles, especially among those who use drugs; using infected razors.
AIDS may be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or childbirth. 

On the basis of the above, it is not necessary to isolate infected people from their healthy colleagues if there is no fear of them passing on the disease. The patient may be dealt with according to regular medical procedures. 
Secondly: deliberately transmitting the disease.
Deliberately passing on AIDS to a healthy person is the deliberate commission of a haraam (forbidden) deed, and is counted as a serious major sin. It requires a punishment in this world, to be determined in accordance with the level of the crime and its impact on individuals and society as a whole.
If the intention was to spread this terrible disease in society, this is counted as a kind of aggression and spreading mischief on earth, which should be met with one of the punishments referred to in the aayah:
“The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.” [al-Maa’idah 5:33]
If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, and this is what happens, but the person who has been infected has not yet died, the person who did this should be punished with ta’zeer (a punishment to be determined by the qaadi or judge). If the infected person dies, then the matter of execution should be looked into.
If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, but this does not happen, then he should be punished with ta’zeer.
Thirdly: considering AIDS to be a terminal illness:
In sharee’ah, AIDS is counted as a terminal illness once it is full-blown and the patient is no longer living a normal life and death is approaching."

                A while ago, Allaah guided me and I came

      and this sunnah reached some of my family members too. At home we were able to create an
      Islamic atmosphere and all the sisters in the house put on Islamic dress. We adhered to
      the Qur’aan and Sunnah as much as possible. Then there was some trouble in our
      country, and the people turned against those who have beards and started to harass them.
      They think that everyone who has a beard wants to kill people and shed their blood, but
      we, as Muslims, have no desire whatsoever to kill people whom our Lord has forbidden us to
      kill. My father, my mother and my family have started urging me to shave my beard. My
      mother says that my father is angry with me, but I am afraid to do anything that goes
      against what the Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and I am
      afraid to commit a sin.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, may Allaah reward you with good for following the guidance of
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for calling
    your family to do likewise.
Secondly, shaving the beard is haraam, and letting it grow is obligatory,
    as you know. Obedience to the Creator takes precedence over obedience to any created
    being, even the closest of relatives. There can be no obedience to any created being if it
    involves disobedience to the Creator, and obedience to any other created being should only
    be with regard to what is good (ma’roof). What you describe of your father being
    angry and upset because you are letting your beard grow is only because he loves you and
    is afraid that what has happened to others may happen to you too. But what happened to
    others was, in most cases, because of provocation on their part, not just because they let
    their beards grow; it also happened to some of those who shave their beards. You must be
    steadfast in your adherence to the truth, and continue to let your beard grow in obedience
    to Allaah and in order to earn His pleasure, even if His creatures are angry. You must
    also avoid the sources of trouble, and put your trust in Allaah, hoping that He will
    provide a way out for you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “…
    And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get
    out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah
    will accomplish His purpose. Indeed, Allaah has set a measure for all things”
    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] and, “…and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty
    to Him, He will make his matter easy for him. That is the Command of Allaah, which He has
    sent down to you, and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will remit his
    sins from him and will enlarge his reward.” [al-Talaaq 65:5].

What is the ruling on shaving the beard or removing part of it?",It is haram to shave your beard because of the general application of texts that forbid resembling the unbelievers. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Trim your moustaches and let your beards grow.”,"Praise be to Allah.Shaving the beard is haram because of the sahih ahadith that clearly state this, and because of the general application of texts that forbid resembling the unbelievers. 
Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the polytheists; let your beards grow and trim your moustaches.” According to another report: “Trim your moustaches and let your beards grow .” 
There are other hadith which convey the same meaning, which is to leave the beard as it is and let it grow long, without shaving, plucking or cutting any part of it. 
Ibn Hazm reported that there was scholarly consensus that it is an obligation to trim the moustache and let the beard grow . He quoted a number of ahadith as evidence, including the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above, and the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not remove any of his moustache is not one of us.” (Classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi). 
Ibn Hazm said in al-Furu’: “This formula according to our colleagues [i.e., the Hanbalis] means that it is haram to shave the beard .” 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Quran, Sunnah and ijma’ (scholarly consensus) all indicate that we must differ from the unbelievers in all aspects and not imitate them, because imitating them on the outside will make us imitate them in their bad deeds and habits, and even in beliefs, which will result in befriending them in our hearts, just as loving them in our hearts will lead to imitating them on the outside. Al-Tirmidhi reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “He is not one of us who imitates people other than us. Do not imitate the Jews and Christians.” According to another version: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them. ” (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad)
‘Umar ibn al-Khattab rejected the testimony of the person who plucked his beard. Al-Imam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamhid: “It is forbidden to shave the beard, and no one does this except men who are effeminate” i.e., those who imitate women. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a thick beard (reported by Muslim from Jabir).

For example, in Britain, the women think that washing thick hair is too difficult in a cold climate, so they cut their hair short.",,"Praise be to Allah.If that is indeed the case, then it is permissible for them to cut their hair short, but only as short as is necessary, and they are not permitted to cut their hair short to look like kaafir women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”
(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 5/182).
Similarly, they are not permitted to cut their hair short in ways that resemble men’s hairstyles, because of the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5435).

When my father became very old and was no longer able to take care of his own personal hygiene needs, I used to trim his moustache and shave his pubic hairs for him, but this meant that I saw his ‘awrah (private parts, which should remain covered) without intending to. Is this a sin on my part or not? I heard that the person who sees his parents’ ‘awrah has to fast for two months – is this correct or not?",,Praise be to Allah.There is no sin on you if you remove your father’s pubic hair when he cannot do this for himself. What you have heard about having to fast for two months is not correct.

    colour and “relaxing” the hair","Question

                I have seen that some people use
      materials to dye their hair different colours, be it black, red, etc., and also using
      something else to make curly hair straight. It is permissible to do such things, and does
      the ruling apply equally to young and old?",,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with changing the hair colour and dyeing it any
    colour, except black. There is also nothing wrong with using something to make curly hair
    straight. This ruling applies to young and old alike, so long as no damage results from
    doing this and the material used is pure (taahir) and something that is allowed in Islam.
    However, dyeing the hair pure black is not allowed for men or women, because the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Change this grey hair, but
    avoid black.” (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 5/168)."
413,1195,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1195,Is It Haram to Have Long Nails?,"Question

What is the ruling on men or women letting their nails grow long? If it is forbidden, what is the wisdom behind this prohibition?",Having long nails is against the fitrah. The reason behind cutting the nails is cleanliness and hygiene because dirt can gather under the nails.,"Praise be to Allah.Cutting the nails is part of the fitrah . Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The fitrah is five things: circumcision , removing the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit hairs .” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).
According to another hadith, ten things are part of the fitrah, including cutting the nails. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set a time limit for us to cut our moustaches, cut our nails, pluck our armpit hairs and shave our pubic hairs: we were not to leave it any longer than forty days.” (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and al-Nasai; this version narrated by Ahmad).
Whoever does not cut his nails is going against the fitrah. The reason behind this is cleanliness and hygiene, because dirt can gather under the nails. It also serves the purpose of making us different from those among the non-Muslims who allow their nails to grow long, and from animals that have claws and talons. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/173)
Another bad habit that many people have is to leave one nail long. All of this is clearly contrary to the ways of the fitrah. 
We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. Allah is the Guide to the Straight Path.

414,1196,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1196,Is Muhammad peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) created from light? What is wrong with celebrating his birthday?,"Question

                In our locality there are people who hold
      celebrations of the birthday of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) every year. They think that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) is not like the rest of mankind, but that he is light from the Light of Allaah
      Himself, that he is present and watching in every place, and that he himself attends every
      gathering held to celebrate his birthday, he hears what the people say about him, and he
      is there with them. For that reason they stand up and say in unison: “Yaa
      Nabi-Allaah, yaa Rasool-Allaah, yaa Habeeb-Allaah, salaam ‘alayka (O Prophet of
      Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, O Beloved of Allaah, peace be upon you).” They call
      out to him as if he were present and ask for his help and support. What is the Islamic
      ruling on this? Is it correct or not? Is it sunnah, bid’ah, or what?",,"Praise be to Allah.alone, and peace and blessings be upon 
  His Messenger and his family and companions.

Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an innovation (bid’ah) 
      which goes against the guidance of the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs 
      (al-khulafaa’ al-raashidoon) and the Sahaabah, may Allaah be 
      pleased with them. It is proven that the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does anything 
      that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” 
      (For more details, please see Question # 249).


Believing that the Prophet  (peace 
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is not like the rest of humanity, and 
      that he is light from the Light of Allaah Himself is not a correct belief, 
      because it contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah has stated that the Prophet 
       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
      is human, and has explained what makes the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) different from the rest of mankind. 
      He said (interpretation of the meaning):

“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It 
    has been inspired to me that your God is One God (Allaah). So whoever hopes 
    for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none 
    as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” [al-Kahf 18:110]
Mankind, human beings, are created, as Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning):
“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from 
    a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife (Hawwa/Eve), and 
    from them both He created many men and women…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:1]
“O mankind, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, 
    then verily! We have created you from dust, then from a nutfah (mixed drops 
    of male and female sexual discharge)…” [al-Hajj 22:5]
“O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a 
    bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, - and as one who invites to Allaah by 
    His leave, and as a lamp spreading light.” [al-Ahzaab 33:45-46]
In contrast, Allaah is the First, and He has no beginning, as 
    He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing 
    is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him), and the Most Near (nothing 
    is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.” [al-Hadeed 
    57:3]
Allaah called His Prophet “light” and a “lamp 
    spreading light” because of the guidance and light with which Allaah 
    sent him, with which Allaah guides all those who answer his call  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):
“… Indeed, there has come to you a light (Prophet 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)) and a plain Book (this Qur’aan).” [al-Maa’idah 5:15]
Saying that he is present and watching in every place, that 
      he is himself present at every gathering to celebrate his birthday, and 
      that he hears what the people present are saying, is all false. There is 
      no basis for this in either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah.
Calling on him and seeking his help and support is a form 
      of major shirk which is not permitted, whether one is calling on the Prophet 
       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
      or on any other created being, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
      meaning):
“… so invoke not anyone along with Allaah.” 
      [al-Junn 72:18]
“And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allaah, any 
      other god of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. 
      Surely! Al-kaafiroon (the disbelievers) will not be successful.” [al-Mu’minoon 
      23:117]
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/4)
The Muslim should follow, not innovate. He should believe in 
  Allaah alone, call on Him alone and seek His help alone. He should not call 
  on or seek the help of anyone else. The consequences of shirk are devastating, 
  as it will wipe out all a person’s good deeds and lead to his doom in Hell. 
  Bid’ah is a serious matter, which will cause a person’s deeds to be 
  thrown back at him, not accepted. The Muslim should love, respect, honour and 
  obey the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
  be upon him), and give his words precedence over the words of any other human 
  being, but it is not permitted to exaggerate about him, or to raise his status 
  above that which has been bestowed upon him by Allaah, or to call on him instead 
  of Allaah, because this is a violation of the rights of Allaah, and involves 
  directing acts of worship to someone other than Allaah, when they should only 
  be directed towards Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. We ask Allaah to 
  help us to do that which will please Him and to avoid that which will earn His 
  wrath, and to help us to love Him and His Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad. 
  And Allaah knows best."

418,1200,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1200,Evidence Prohibiting of Mixing of Men and Women,"Question

My husband and I wanted to know if it were permissable to take Arabic classes at a college where the classes are mixed (men-women). We understand that there is no mixing between the sexes, but confused about the definition of ""mixing"". Please tell us what is permissable, what is not and give proof",,"Praise be to Allah.The meeting together, mixing, and intermingling of men and women in one place, the crowding of them together, and the revealing and exposure of women to men are prohibited by the Law of Islam (Shari'ah). These acts are prohibited because they are among the causes for fitnah (temptation or trial which implies evil consequences), the arousing of desires, and the committing of indecency and wrongdoing.
Among the many proofs of prohibition of the meeting and mixing of men and women in the Quran and Sunnah are:
Verse No. 53 of Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates (Interpretation of the meaning); ""...for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs...""
In explaining this Verse, Ibn Kathir (May Allah have mercy on him) said: ""Meaning, as I forbade you to enter their rooms, I forbid you to look at them at all. If one wants to take something from them, one should do so without looking at them. If one wants to ask a woman for something, the same has to be done from behind a screen.""
The Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) enforced separation of men and women even at Allah’s most revered and preferred place, the mosque. This was accomplished via the separation of the women’s rows from the men’s; men were asked to stay in the mosque after completion of the obligatory prayer so that women will have enough time to leave the mosque; and, a special door was assigned to women. Evidence of the foregoing are:
Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said that after Allah’s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said ""as-Salamu ‘Alaykum wa Rahmatullah’ twice announcing the end of prayer, women would stand up and leave. He would stay for a while before leaving. Ibn Shihab said that he thought that the staying of the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) was in order for the women to be able to leave before the men who wanted to depart."" Narrated by al-Bukhari under No. 793.
Abu Dawood under No. 876 narrates the same hadith in Kitab al-Salaat under the title ""Insiraaf an-Nisaa’ Qabl al-Rijaal min al-Salaah"" (Departure of Women before Men after the Prayer). Ibn ‘Umar said that Allah’s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""We should leave this door (of the mosque) for women."" Naafi’ said: ""Ibn ‘Umar never again entered through that door until he died."" Narrated by Abu Dawood under No. 484 in ""Kitab as-Salah"" under the Chapter entitled: ""at-Tashdid fi Thalik"".
Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: """"The best of the men’s rows is the first and the worst is the last, and the best of the women’s rows is the last and the worst in the first."" Narrated by Muslim under No. 664.
This is the greatest evidence that the Law of Islam (Shari'ah) forbids meeting and mixing of men and women. The farther the men are from the women’s rows, the better, and vice versa.
If these procedures and precautions were prescribed and adhered to in a mosque, which is a pure place of worship where people are as far away as they ever are from the arousal of desire and temptation, then no doubt the same procedures need to be followed even more rigorously at other places.
 
Abu Usayd al-Ansari narrated that he heard Allah’s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) say to the women on his way out of the mosque when he saw men and women mixing together on their way home:
‘Give way (i.e., walk to the sides) as it is not appropriate for you to walk in the middle the road.’ Thereafter, women would walk so close to the wall that their dresses would get caught on it. Narrated by Abu Dawood in ""Kitab al-Adab min Sunanihi, Chapter: Mashyu an-Nisa Ma’ ar-Rijal fi at-Tariq.""We know that the intermingling, mixing and crowding together of men and women is part of today’s unavoidable yet regrettable affliction in most places, such as markets, hospitals, colleges, etc., but:
 
· We will not willfully choose or accept mixing and crowding, particularly in religious classes and council meetings in Islamic Centers.
 
· We take precautions to avoid meeting and mixing of men and women as much as possible while at the same time achieving desired goals and objectives. This result can be achieved by designating separate places assigned for men and women, using different doors for each, utilizing modern means of communication such as microphones, video recorders etc., and expediting efforts to have enough female teachers to teach women, etc.
 
· We show fear of Allah as much as we can by not looking at members of the opposite sex and by applying self-restraint.
There follow some of the results of a study on mixing undertaken by some Muslim social science researchers. 
When we put the following question: What is the Islamic ruling on mixing as far as you know? The results were as follows:
76% of respondents said “It is not permitted.”
12% said, “It is permitted” – but moral, religious, etc. restrictions apply…
12% said, “I don’t know.” 
Which would you choose?
 If you had the choice between working in a mixed workplace and working in another where there was no mixing, which would you choose?
The responses to this question were as follows:
76% would choose the workplace where there was no mixing.
9% preferred the mixed workplace.
15% would accept any workplace which suited their specialties, regardless of whether it was mixed or not. 
Very embarrassing 
Have any embarrassing situations ever happened to you because of mixing? 
Among the embarrassing moments mentioned by respondents in this study were the following: 
I was at work one day, and  I went into one department where one of my female colleagues who wears hijaab had taken off her hijaab in front of her female colleagues. My entrance took her by surprise and I was very embarrassed as a result. 
I had to do an experiment in the lab at university, but I was absent on the day of the experiment. I had to go to the lab on the following day, and I found myself the only male among a group of female students, in addition to a female teacher and a female lab technician. I was very embarrassed and felt very awkward with all those female eyes glaring at me. 
I was trying to take a feminine towel out of one of the drawers when I was surprised by a male colleague standing behind me, who wanted to take something from his own private drawer. He noticed that I was embarrassed and he left the room quickly to avoid my embarrassment. 
It so happened that one of the girls at the university bumped into me when turning a corner in a crowded corridor. She was walking quickly, going to one of the lectures. As a result of this collision, she lost her balance, and I caught her in my arms, as if I was embracing her. You can imagine how embarrassed I and this girl felt in front of a group of careless young people. 
One of my female colleagues fell on the stairs in the university and her clothes fell open in an extremely embarrassing fashion. She landed upside down and could not help herself; the young men standing nearby had no option but to cover her and help her to get up. 
I work in a company and I went in to give some papers to my boss. When I was going out, my boss called me back. I turned around and saw him with his face turned away. I was waiting for him to ask me for a file or for more papers, and I was surprised by his hesitancy. I turned away to the left side of his office, pretending to be busy with something, and he spoke to me at the same time. I thought that this boss would say anything except what he actually said, which was to point out that my garment was stained with menstrual blood. Can the earth open up and swallow a human being at the moment of making sincere supplication? For I prayed that the earth would open up and swallow me. 
Victims of mixing… True stories 
Lost hope 
Umm Muhammad, a mature woman over the age of 40, tells her story. 
I lived a life of modest means with my husband. There was never any closeness and harmony, and my husband did not have the kind of strong personality that a woman would hope for, but his good nature made me overlook the fact that I was the one who was responsible for most of the decision making in the family. 
My husband often used to mention the name of his friend and business partner, and he would talk about him in my presence, and I often used to meet with him in his office which was originally part of our apartment. This went on for many years, until circumstances led to us exchanging visits with this person and his family. These family visits were repeated and because of his close friendship with my husband, we did not notice how the number of visits increased and how many hours a single visit would last. He often used to come on his own to sit with us, me and my husband, for long visits. My husband’s trust in him knew no bounds, and as days passed I got to know this person very well, and saw how wonderful and decent he was.  I began to feel a strong attraction towards this man, and at the same time I began to sense that the feeling was mutual.
 Things took a strange turn after that, when I realized that this man was the kind of person I had always dreamed about. Why had he come along now, after all these years? The more this man’s status increased in my eyes, the more my husband’s status diminished. It was as if I had needed to see the beauty of his character in order to discover how ugly my husband’s character was.
 The matter between this person and myself did not go beyond these persistent thoughts which were occupying my mind night and day. Neither he nor I ever voiced what we felt in our hearts… until today. Yet despite that my life is over and my husband is little more than a weak man with no self-esteem. I hate him and I do not know how all this hatred towards him started to boil over. I wonder how I put up with him all these years, bearing all these burdens by myself, facing life’s problems on my own.
 Things got so bad that I asked him for a divorce, and he divorced me at my request. After that he became a broken man. Even worse than that is that after my marriage was wrecked and my children and husband were devastated, problems arose in this man's family. His wife, with her feminine intuition, realized what had been going on in his heart of hearts, and his life became hell. She was overwhelmed with jealousy to the extent that one night she left her house at 2 a.m. and came to attack my house, screaming, weeping and hurling accusations. His marriage was also about to collapse.
 I admit that the lovely gatherings which we used to enjoy gave us the opportunity to get to know one another at a time that was not appropriate at this stage in our lives.
His marriage has been wrecked and so has mine. I have lost everything, and now I know that my circumstances and his will not permit us to take any positive step towards coming together. Now I am more miserable than I have ever been, and I am looking for illusionary happiness and lost hopes.
 Tit-for-tat
 Umm Ahmad tells us:
 My husband had a group of married friends, and because of our close friendship with them, we used to get together with them once a week in one of our houses, to enjoy an evening of chat.
 Deep down in my heart I was never really comfortable with the atmosphere in which we would have dinner, sweets, snacks and drinks of juice accompanied by waves of laughter because of the jokes and chit-chats that often went beyond the bounds of good manners. 
In the name of friendship, the barriers were lifted and every now and then one would hear suppressed laughter between a woman and the husband of another woman. The jokes were too much, dealing – with no sense of shyness –with sensitive topics such as sex and women’s private matters. This was usual and was even accepted and regarded as desirable.
 Although I indulged in these things along with them, my conscience made me feel guilty. Then the day came when it became quite clear just how ugly and filthy this atmosphere was.
 The telephone rang, and I heard the voice of one of the friends in this group. I said hello to him and apologized that my husband was not home. He replied that he knew that, and that he was calling to speak to me! After he suggested starting a relationship with me, I got very angry and spoke harshly to him and cursed him. All he could do was laugh and say, “Don’t try and show these good manners to me; go and check on your husband’s good manners and see what he is doing…” I was devastated by what he said, but I pulled myself together and said to myself, this person is only trying to cause the break up of your marriage. But he succeeded in planting the seeds of doubt concerning my husband. 
Shortly after that, the major disaster struck. I discovered that my husband was cheating on me with another woman. It was the matter of life or death as far as I was concerned. I found my husband out and I confronted him, saying: “You are not the only one who can have a relationship. I have received a similar proposition.” And I told him all about his friend. He was stunned and absolutely shocked. (I said:) “If you want me to respond in kind to your relationship with that woman, then this is for that, tit-for-tat.” This was a huge slap in the face for him. He knew that I did not intend to do that in reality, but he realized the great disaster that had befallen our lives and the immoral atmosphere in which we were living. I suffered a great deal until my husband finally left that loose woman with whom he was having a relationship, as he admitted to me. Yes, he left her and came back to his family and children, but how can I ever feel the same towards him as I used to? Who will restore respect for him in my heart? This huge wound in my heart is still bleeding out of regret and rage at that filthy atmosphere; it still bears testimony to the fact that what they call innocent get-togethers are in reality anything but innocent. My heart still begs for mercy from the Lord of Glory. 
Intelligence can also be a temptation (fitnah)
 ‘Abd al-Fattaah says: 
I work as the head of department in one of the big companies. For a long time I admired one of my female colleagues, not for her beauty, but for her serious attitude towards her work, her intelligence and her excellent achievements – in addition to the fact that she was a decent and modest person who focused only on her work. This admiration turned into attachment, and I am a married man who fears Allah and never misses any obligatory prayer. I expressed my feelings to her and she rebuffed me. She is married and has children as well. She sees no reason why I should have any kind of relationship with her, whether it be friendship, as work colleagues or based on admiration… etc. Evil thoughts come to me sometimes, and deep down I wish that her husband would divorce her so that I could get her.
 I started to put pressure on her at work and put her down in front of my bosses. Perhaps this was a form of revenge on my part, but she accepted it with good manners and did not complain or comment. She works and works; her performance speaks of her quality, and she knows this well. The more she resisted me, the stronger my infatuation grew. 
I am not a person who is easily tempted by women, because I fear Allah and I do not overstep the mark with them and go beyond what is required by my work. But this woman attracted me. What is the solution?… I do not know.
 Baby ducks know how to swim
 N.A.A., a nineteen-year-old girl, tells us: 
At that time I was a little girl. My innocent eyes watched those evening get-togethers when family friends would meet in the house. What I remember is that I could only see one man, who was my father. I watched him as he moved about the room, how his glances would devour the women present, looking at their thighs and chests, admiring this one’s eyes, that one’s hair, the other’s hips. My poor mother had no choice but to take care of these get-togethers. She was a very simple lady. 
Among the women present there was one woman who would deliberately try to attract my father’s attention, sometimes by coming close to him, and sometimes by making enticing movements. I would watch this with concern, whilst my mother was busy in the kitchen for the sake of her guests.
 These gatherings stopped suddenly and I tried, young as I was, to understand and make sense of what had happened, but I could not. 
What I remember was that my mother collapsed completely at that time, and she could not stand to hear my father’s name mentioned in the house. I used to hear mysterious words whispered by the adults around me: “Betrayal… bedroom… she saw them with her own eyes… despicable woman… in a very shameful position…” etc. These were the key words which only the adults could understand.
 I grew up and came to understand, and I bore a grudge against all men. All of them were treacherous. My mother was a broken woman and accused every woman who came to us of being a man-snatcher who wanted to make my father fall into her trap. My father hasn’t changed. He is still practising his favourite hobby of chasing women, but now he does it outside the home. Now I am nineteen years old and I know lots of young men. I feel great pleasure in taking revenge on them, because every one of them is an exact copy of my father. I tempt them and entice them, without letting them get anywhere near me. They follow me in gatherings and in the marketplaces because of my movements and deliberate gestures. Sometimes my phone never stops ringing and I feel proud of what I do to avenge the sex of Hawwa’ and my mother. But sometimes I feel so miserable and such a failure that it almost chokes me. My life is shadowed by a huge dark cloud, and its name is my father. 
Before it is too late
 S.N.A. tells of her experience: 
I never imagined that my work circumstances would force me to be in contact with the opposite sex (men), but this in fact is what happened… 
In the beginning,  I used to cover and screen myself from men by wearing niqaab (face-veil), but some of the sisters advised me that this dress was attracting more attention to my presence, and it would be better for me to take off the niqaab, especially since my eyes were somewhat attractive. So I removed the cover from my face, thinking that this was better. But by continuing to mix with my colleagues, I discovered that I was the odd one out because of my antisocial attitude and my insistence on not joining in the conversation and chatting with others. Everyone was wary of this “lone-wolf” woman (as they saw me), and this is what was stated clearly by one person who affirmed that he would not want to deal with such a snooty and stand-offish character. But I knew that I was the opposite, in fact, and I decided that I would not oppress myself and put myself in a difficult position with my colleagues. So I started to join in their chats and exchanges of anecdotes, and they all discovered that I could speak eloquently and persuasively, and that I could influence others. I could also speak in a manner that was determined yet at the same time was attractive to some of my colleagues. It was not long before I noticed some changes in the expression of my direct supervisor; with some embarrassment, he was enjoying the way I spoke and moved, and he would deliberately bring up topics in the conversation where I would see that hateful look in his eyes. I do not deny the fact that I started to entertain some thoughts about this man. I found it astonishing that a man could fall so easily into the trap of a woman who was religiously committed, so how must it be in the case of women who adorn themselves and invite men to commit immoral actions? In fact, I did not think of him in any way which went beyond the bounds of sharee’ah, but he did occupy a space in my thoughts for quite some time. But soon my self-respect made me reject the idea of being a source of enjoyment for this man in any way, shape or form, even if it was only psychological in nature, and I stopped getting involved in any kind of work that would force me to sit alone with him. In the end, I reached the following conclusions:
1-  Attraction between the sexes can occur in any circumstances, no matter how much men and women may deny that. The attraction may start within the bounds of sharee’ah and end up going beyond those bounds.
     Even if a person protects himself (by marriage), he is not safe from the snares of the Shaytaan.
3-  Even though a person may be able to guarantee himself and he works with the opposite sex within reasonable limits, he cannot guarantee the feelings of the other party.
     Finally, there is nothing good in mixing and it does not bear fruit as they claim. On the contrary, it corrupts sound thinking.
What now?
We may ask, what comes next, after this discussion on the matter of mixing?
It’s about time for us to recognize that no matter how we try to beautify the issue of mixing and take the matter lightly, its consequences are bound to catch up with us, and the harm it causes will have disastrous results for our families. Sound common sense refuses to accept that mixing is a healthy atmosphere for human relations. This is the sound common sense which made most of the people included in this survey (76%) prefer working in a non-mixed environment. The same percentage (76%) said that mixing is not permitted according to the sharee’ah. What makes us sit up and take notice is not this honourable percentage – which indicates the purity of our Islamic society and the cleanness of its members’ hearts – but the small number who said that mixing is permitted; they number 12%. This group, with no exceptions, said that mixing is permitted but within the limits set by religion, custom (‘urf), traditions, good manners, conscience, modesty, covering and other worthy values which, in their opinion, keep mixing within proper limits.
We ask them: is the mixing which we see nowadays in our universities, market-places, work-places and family and social gatherings, taking place within the limits referred to above? Or are these places filled with transgressions in terms of clothing, speech, interactions and behaviour? We see wanton displays of adornment (tabarruj), not proper covering; we see fitnah (temptations) and dubious relationships, with no good manners and no conscience and no covering. We can conclude that the kind of mixing that is happening nowadays is unacceptable even to those who approve of mixing in a clean atmosphere. 
It’s about time for us to recognize that mixing provides a fertile breeding-ground for social poisons to invade and take over our society without anyone ever realizing that it is mixing which is the cause. Mixing is the prime element in this silent fitnah, in the shade of which betrayals erupt, homes are wrecked and hearts are broken. 
We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and to reform our society. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

Everyone who is in charge of orphans’ property has to dispose of it in the manner which he thinks is in the orphans’ best interests. With regard to that which is not in their interests, or which serves some interest but there is some doubt as to whether it is in their best interests, then it is not permissible to dispose of it in that manner, because of the quotation mentioned (interpretation of the meaning):
“And come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it” [al-An’aam 6:152]

426,1226,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1226,Sighting the moon not following astronomical calculations,"Question

There is a big dispute among Muslim scholars concerning the timing of the beginning of Ramadaan and ‘Eid al-Fitr. Some of them act upon the sighting of the new moon, because of the hadeeth, “Fast when you sight it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you sight it…”; others rely on the calculations of astronomers, saying that these scientists have progressed so far in the science of astronomy that they are able to know when the lunar month begins. Who is right in this matter?",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the correct opinion which must be acted upon is that indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” That is the basis for determining the beginning and end of Ramadaan by the actual sighting of the new moon. The Islamic sharee’ah with which Allaah sent our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is universal and everlasting, until the Day of Resurrection. (It is valid for every time and place, whether worldly sciences are advanced or otherwise, whether there are telescopes etc. or not, whether there are any people in the population who are able to do astronomical calculations or not. Sighting the moon is something that people of all places and times can do, unlike calculations which may or may not be within the reach of the people, and telescopes which may or may not be available)
Secondly: Allaah knew what progress would be made in astronomy and other sciences, but despite that He still said (interpretation of the meaning): “… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” So the beginning and ending of Ramadaan are connected to the actual sighting of the moon, and not to the calculations of astronomers, even though Allaah knew that the astronomers would develop their science to the point where they would be able to calculate the positions of the stars and heavenly bodies. The Muslims are obliged to follow what Allaah has prescribed for them through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), basing the beginning and end of the fast on the sighting of the moon. This is like the consensus of the scholars, whoever differs with this and relies on calculations is shaadhdh (“odd”) and his opinion cannot be relied on. And Allaah knows best."

428,1239,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1239,The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals,"Question

What is The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals ?",,"Praise be to Allah.There are two aspects to the answer to this question: general and specific. The general answer is that the Muslim believes that Allah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, and He does not create anything in vain; all of His actions are based on Wisdom. If the wisdom behind any of His actions is hidden from the believer, then he should still adhere to this principle, and not think of his Lord in bad terms. 
The specific answer is that the wisdom behind the creation of these things is to manifest the perfect nature of Allah’s creation and control of all things. Even though the created things are so many, He provides for them all. He also tests people by means of these  (dangerous creatures), rewards those who are afflicted by them and makes manifest the bravery of those who kill them. By creating them, He tests His slaves’ faith and certainty: the believer accepts the matter and submits, whilst the doubter says, “What is the point of Allah creating this?!” He also demonstrates the weakness and incapability of man, whereby he suffers pain and sickness because of a creature which is far smaller than he is. One of the scholars was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of flies. He said, so that Allah may humiliate the noses of the tyrants with them. Because of the existence of harmful creatures, it becomes apparent how great is the blessing in the creation of beneficial things, as it is said that contrast with the opposite demonstrates the nature of things. The study of medicine has demonstrated that many beneficial drugs are derived from the venom of snakes and the like. Glory be to the One Who has created benefits in things that to all outward appearances are harmful. Moreover, many of these dangerous animals are food for other creatures which are beneficial, and this forms the ecological cycle in the environments where Allah has created them.
 But the Muslim has to believe that everything that Allah does is good, and that there is no pure evil in what He creates. In everything that He creates there has to be some aspect of good, even if it is hidden from us, as is the case with the creation of Iblees, who is the head of evil. But there is wisdom and a purpose behind his creation, for Allah tests His creatures by means of him, to distinguish the obedient from the disobedient, those who strive from those who are negligent, the people of Paradise from the people of Hell.
 We ask Allah to bless us with strength of faith and understanding of our religion. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace."
429,1244,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1244,What Happens to Those Who Never Heard of Islam?,"Question

 Someone has asked me this question (she is about to become a muslimah). Her statement: 'A lot of others will never meet a Muslim in person. Will they be held responsible for their ignorance? What exactly does this mean: ""After the revelation of the Quran whoever receives this message & does not abide by it is a non-believer""?
i. Who is considered to have received the message?
ii. Isn't it possible for people to have not received the message even though the Quran is in existence?'","Whoever dies without having heard the message or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the Hands of Allah Who Knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly.","Praise be to Allah.It is part of the justice of Allah that He does not punish any people until He has first sent a warning to them and unless there is evidence against them. Allah does not treat anybody unfairly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).” [Al-Isra 17:15]
In his Tafsir (commentary) on this verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“These words, ‘And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)’ tell us of the justice of Allah, may He be Exalted, and that He does not punish anyone until after He has established evidence against him by sending a Messenger to him. This is like the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Every time a group is cast therein [into Hell], its keeper will ask, Did no warner come to you? They will say, Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error.” [Al-Mulk 67:8] and: “And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of its prisoners). And its keepers will say, Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours? They will say: Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!” [Al-Zumar 39:71]
A person who has never heard of Islam or the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and who has never heard the message in its correct and true form, will not be punished by Allah if he dies in a state of disbelief . 
If it were asked what his fate will be, the answer will be that Allah will test him on the Day of Resurrection: if he obeys, he will enter Paradise and if he disobeys he will enter Hell. The evidence for this is the Hadith of Al-Aswad ibn Sari` (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are four (who will protest) to Allah on the Day of Resurrection: the deaf man who never heard anything, the insane man, the very old man, and the man who died during the Fatrah (the interval between the time of `Isa (Jesus, upon whom be peace) and the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). The deaf man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything. The insane man will say, O Lord, Islam came but the children ran after me and threw stones at me. The very old man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I did not understand anything. The man who died during the Fatrah will say, O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me. He will accept their promises of obedience, then word will be sent to them to enter the Fire. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them.
According to another report, he said: “Whoever enters it, it will be cool and safe for him, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged to it.” (The Hadith was reported by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Hibban, and classed as authentic by Al-Albani, Sahih Al-Jami, 881)
Everyone who hears the message of Islam in a sound and correct form (and rejects it), will have evidence against him. Whoever dies without having heard the message or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the hands of Allah. Allah knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly. And Allah is All-Seer of His slaves.

It is not possible to see the new moon with the naked eye before it is 30 hours old, and in addition to that, it is sometimes not possible to see it at all because of the weather conditions. On this basis, is it permissible to resort to using astronomical information to calculate the likely time for sighting the new moon and the start of Ramadan, or do we have to actually sight the new moon before we start fasting the blessed month of Ramadan?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to use telescopes etc. to sight the moon, but it is not permissible to rely on astronomical data to confirm the beginning or end of the blessed month of Ramadan, because Allah has not prescribed that for us in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What He has prescribed for us is to confirm the beginning and end of Ramadan by sighting the new moon of Ramadan to start fasting, and the new moon of Shawwaal to end the fast and gather to offer the Eid prayers. Allah has made the new moons to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj, so it is not permissible for Muslims to use any other method to determine the times for acts of worship such as fasting, celebrating Eid, performing Hajj, fasting for two months as expiation (kafaarah) for killing someone by mistake or divorcing one’s wife by zihaar, and so on. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” On this basis, the one who does not see the new moon from the time it rises on a clear or cloudy night must complete the month (of Sha’baan) with thirty days.
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/100). This is the case if the sighting of the new moon is not confirmed in another country; if the moon is sighted according to the guidelines of Sharee’ah, then fasting is obligatory, according to the majority of scholars.
And Allah knows best."
431,1248,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1248,"Do different times of moonrise matter, and what should Muslim communities in the West do","Question

 
Since the prophet said ""Begin fasting after sighting the moon"", how can muslims be fasting one on Tuesday in one part of the world and wednesday in another part. We should all begin our fast at the same time regardless of where we live.
We are students in the U.S. and Canada, and we face the same problem every year at the beginning of Ramadan, because the Muslims are split into three groups:A group that fasts when the new moon is sighted in the city in which they live.
A group that fasts when fasting starts in Saudi Arabia.
A group that fasts when they hear news from the Muslim students’ union in the U.S. and Canada which watches for the new moon in different parts of America, and as soon as the new moon is sighted in one city, they spread the news to different Islamic centres so that the Muslims in America can start fasting on the same day, despite the great distances between the different cities.
Which group should we follow? Whose sighting of the moon should we rely on? Please give us a fatwa, may Allah reward you.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the fact that the moon rises at different times in different places is a well-established fact; no scholar disputes this. However, the scholars differ as to whether this matters or not.
Secondly: the question as to whether different times of moonrise is something that matters is a theoretical question in which ijtihaad is permissible. Those who have knowledge of science and religion differ on this matter, and this difference of opinion is permissible; the one who has the correct opinion will have two rewards, one for being right and one for making ijtihaad; the one whose opinion is wrong will still be rewarded for his ijtihaad.
The scholars’ differences on this matter may be described as one of two: some of them thought that the differences in the times of the moon’s rising was of significance, and others thought that it was not. Both groups cite evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and maybe even quote the same text, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189] and the hadeeth, “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” The difference is one of interpretation of the texts, as each group has its own methods of deriving evidence.
Thirdly: the committee has looked at the issue of confirming the new moon by calculations and what was said on this matter in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and they have studied the opinions of the scholars on this matter. They decided unanimously that astronomical calculations do not count when it comes to confirming the new moon for shar'i purposes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” and also: “Do not fast until you see it [the new moon] and do not stop fasting until you see it…”, and because of the evidence that is derived from these ahaadeeth.
The Standing Committee on Scientific Research and Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’) thinks that the Muslim students’ union (or any other group representing the Muslim community) in countries where the government is not Islamic should take the place of an Islamic government in the matter of confirming the new moon for the people living in those non-Islamic countries.
On the basis of the above, this union has the choice of two options: either to consider the differences in times of moonrise to be of significance, or not to do so. Then they should inform all the Muslims in their country what their opinion is, and the Muslims have to follow what they have been told, so as to unite the Muslims in their fasting and to put an end to disputes and confusion. Everyone who lives in those countries should try to sight the moon in the place where they are living, and if one or more trustworthy persons sight the moon, they should fast according to that and tell the union to spread the news. This is at the beginning of Ramadan; at the end of the month there has to be two witnesses to see the new moon of Shawwaal or the completion of thirty days of Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.”

2. Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is one of us, a member of my family. Allah will guide him in a single night."" (Musnad Ahmad, 2/58, hadith 645, edited by Ahmad al-Shaakir, who said: its isnaad is saheeh; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/1367. This hadith was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 6735). Ibn Katheer said: ""This means that Allah will forgive him, grant him help, inspire him and guide him, when he was not like this before."" (Al-Nihaayah, al-Fitan wal-Malaahim, 1/29; edited by Taha Zayni).
 
3. Abu Saeed al-Khudri said: ""The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is of my lineage, with a high forehead and a long, thin, curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years."" (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Mahdi, 11/375, hadith 4265; Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557; he said: this is a saheeh hadith according to the conditions of Muslim, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. See also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6736).
 
4. Umm Salamah said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) say: The Mahdi is of my lineage and family, from the descendants of Faatimah."" (Sunan Abu Dawud, 11/373; Sunan Ibn Maajah. 2/1368. Al-Albaani said that it is saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami, 6734)
 
5. Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader the Mahdi will say, ""Come and lead us in prayer,"" but he will say, ""No, one of them should lead them as an honour to this ummah from Allah."""" The version narrated by Muslim says: "" Then Eesaa ibn Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say, Come and lead us in prayer, but he will say, No, some of you are leaders over others as an honour from Allah to this ummah.""

7. Abdullaah ibn Masood reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""The world will not come to an end until the Arabs are ruled by a man from my family whose name will be the same as mine."" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/199, hadith 3573. Another version says: "" whose name is the same as mine and whose fathers name is the same as my fathers."" Sunan Abi Dawud, 11/370).
 
The ahaadeeth concerning the appearance of the Mahdi reach the level of Tawaatur in meaning (tawaatur refers to a hadith which was narrated by so many people through so many isnaads that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). The imaams and scholars of this ummah have stated this, and a few of their comments are quoted below:
 
1. Al-Haafiz Abul-Hasan al-Aabiri said: ""The mutawaatir reports from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) describing the Mahdi are very many. They state that the Mahdi will be of his family, that he will rule for seven years, that he will fill the earth with justice, that Eesaa ibn Maryam will emerge and help him to kill the Dajjaal, and that he will lead this ummah in prayer and Eesaa will pray behind him.""
 
2. Muhammad al-Barzanji said, in his book al-Ishaaah li Ashraat al-Saaah: ""The major signs and the signs that will be immediately followed by the Hour: these signs are many, of which the Mahdi will be the first. Know that the ahaadeeth that have been narrated about him in various reports are numerous."" He also said: ""You know that the ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi, his appearance at the end of time, and his lineage and descent from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) via Faatimah reach the level of tawaatur in meaning, so there is no point in denying them.""
 
3. Al-Allaamah Muhammad al-Safaareeni said: ""There are so many reports which speak of the appearance of the Mahdi that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning; they are very popular among the scholars of Sunnah and have become part of their faith."" Then he quotes a number of ahaadeeth and reports about the appearance of the Mahdi and the names of the Sahaabah from whom they were narrated: ""Many reports were narrated from the Sahaabah whose names were mentioned and others whose names were not mentioned, may Allah be pleased with them all, and from the Taabieen after them, all of which proves that this is definitive knowledge. Belief in the appearance of the Mahdi is obligatory, as it has been confirmed by the scholars and is listed among the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah.""
 
4. Al-Allaamah al-Mujtahid al-Shawkaani said: ""The ahaadeeth that we have come across that speak of the awaited Mahdi reach the level of tawaatur, including fifty saheeh, hasan and daeef munjabar ahaadeeth. There are mutawaatir without a doubt; indeed they are more mutawaatir than others, according to all the standards of usool. There are also many reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi and that reach the level of marfoo, so there is no room for individual opinions in such an issue.""
 
5. Al-Allaamah al-Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khaan said: ""Even though there are different versions of reports concerning the Mahdi, they are so many that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning. They are to be found in al-Sunan and other books of Islam.""
 
6. Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Jafar al-Kattaani said: ""The conclusion is that the ahaadeeth narrated concerning the Mahdi are mutawaatir, as are the ahaadeeth concerning the Dajjaal and the descent of Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace."" (See Ashraat al-Saaah by Yoosuf ibn Abdullaah al-Waabil, pp. 195-203).
 
You should be aware that some liars have fabricated ahaadeeth about the Mahdi, and others have even claimed to be he, or that he belongs to a group other than Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. Some of these ""false mahdis"" have tried to deceive the slaves of Allah for some worldly gain and to distort the picture of Islaam. Some have started movements and revolutions and gathered those people and supporters whom they were able to deceive. Then they were destroyed, and their lies and falsehood were exposed. None of this affects the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah in the Mahdi, upon whom be peace, and that he will undoubtedly appear and rule the earth in accordance with Islamic Shareeah.

actas a Immam used to trim his beard inspite that he is good 
reciter of quran and also has a good voice.

that there is the altenative of boys who can act as imam.
2. My wife is preganent in our second months she can only 
fast few days what shall I do to rectify her due days which she 
didn't fast.",,"Praise be to Allah.
  If your imaam shaves his beard, then you should advise him to let it grow, in 
  adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and 
  blessings of Allaah be upon him). If he refuses, then ask someone else who can 
  recite Qur'aan well, even if he has not memorized as much or does not have as 
  beautiful a voice. If you cannot find anyone but this man who can recite well, 
  then let him lead the prayers, but keep advising him. May Allaah guide him to 
  follow the sunnah and become a leader who sets the right example.
  One of the scholars was asked the following question: We are led in prayer by 
  a man who shaves his beard. Are we permitted to pray behind him or not?
  He answered: If this man who shaves his beard is the official permanent imaam 
  in a mosque, you should try to replace him with someone better, and look for 
  someone who is righteous and qualified, and free of this sin, who could be appointed 
  as the imaam. If he is an imaam who always leads the prayers in an office or 
  school, leading zuhr prayers during work hours, then first of all you should 
  advise him of how abhorrent his action is. If he then persists, then try to 
  find someone else who does not have this fault, even if he is less skilled in 
  recitation. But if this is a situation where he is leading the prayers only 
  once, then there is nothing wrong with praying behind him if he goes forward 
  to lead the prayer and you cannot find anyone better than him. In general, such 
  a prayer should be good enough, in sha Allaah, but you should know that you 
  have to advise him and every other Muslim who falls into the error of committing 
  this sin or others.

What should a Muslim do if he moves from one country to another during Ramadan, where the people started fasting on a different day?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person finds himself in a country where the people have already started fasting, he must fast with them, because he must follow the ruling of the country he is in. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Fast when the people fast, break your fast when the people break their fast, and offer your sacrifice when the people offer their sacrifice.”
(Reported by Abu Dawood with a jayyid isnaad; there are corroborating reports narrated by Abu Dawood and others).
Suppose that he moved from a country where he had begun fasting with the people there, and went to another country. He has to either break his fast or continue fasting according to the ruling of the people in the country to which he has travelled, even if they end their fast earlier than the country where he started fasting. But if it turns out that he has fasted less than twenty-nine days, he must make up the fasts later on, because the hijri month cannot be less than twenty-nine days."

What is the importance of 13th, 21st, 22nd, and27th of the Islamic month of Rajab.",,"Praise be to Allah. 
There is nothing special about these particular days at all. All the days of Rajab are special, with no exception, because Rajab is one of the Sacred Months, like Dhoo’l- Qi’dah, Dhoo’l-Hijjah and Muharram.
The thirteenth day of each month - not just Rajab - is one of the three Ayyaam al-Beed (white days) on which it is encouraged to fast. These days are the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each hijri month.
Many of those who follow bid’ah (innovations) think that there is something special about certain days and do special acts of worship on those days, with no sound Islaamic basis or evidence (daleel). Their deeds are not acceptable, because they have innovated something in the religion of Allah without the permission of Allah.

I have diabetes type II which is NIDM non-insulin dependent diabetes, I don't use any medicine, I only control diet and I do little physical exercise to keep in right level of my sugar(blood).
I have had this disease for one year and two months. Last Ramadan I fasted some days but I could not continue due to my low level of sugar(blood). This year I feel good (Alhamdu Lillah) I ONLY feel pain in my brain during fasting!? So my question is, is it my DUTY to fast despite my disease? Can I test my blood during fasting times; ""causing blood to come from my fingers""?","1- If you suffer from kidney disease or diabetes and similar diseases where fasting will cause harm, you are allowed to break the fast. 
2- The correct view regarding taking blood from veins for testing is that this does not break the fast, but if it is done often, it is better to leave it until night-time.","Praise be to Allah.Can sick people break the fast?
It is prescribed for sick people not to fast in Ramadan, if fasting will cause harm or make the sickness worse, or if they need treatment during the day in the form of medicine or pills that must be swallowed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah loves people to avail themselves of His concessions (rukhsah) just as He hates them to commit sin.” According to another version, “As He loves His commands to be obeyed.” 
Can we check sugar during fasting?
With regard to taking blood from veins for testing etc., the correct view is that this does not break the fast, but if it is done often, it is better to leave it until night-time. If it is done during the day then to be on the safe side that day should be made up, because this is akin to cupping.” (Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), from Fatawa Islamiyyah, vol. 2, p. 139) 
Can diabetics fast?
Sickness is of various kinds: 

That which does not affect the fast, such as a light cold or mild headache or toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible to break the fast, even though some of the scholars permitted that because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “and whoever is ill…”[al-Baqarah 2:185]

But we say that this ruling is based on a reason, which is that not fasting is easier. If that is the case, then we would say that not fasting is better, but if fasting does not have an effect on him then it is not permissible to break the fast, and he has to fast. 

If fasting is difficult for the sick person, but it does not harm him, then it is makruh for him to fast and it is Sunnah for him to break his fast. 
If fasting is difficult for him and will cause him harm , such as a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and similar cases where fasting will cause harm. In this case fasting is haram. Hence we may see that some mujtahids and sick people make a mistake when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they refuse to break their fast. We say that they are mistaken because they refuse to accept the kindness of Allah and the concession that He has given to them, and they are harming themselves, although Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not kill yourselves”[al-Nisa 4:29] (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 6, 352-254)

442,1326,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1326,Does a woman’s continual discharge break her wudu?,"Question

A woman sees some liquids (yellow color) in her underware while she is not in period. This frequently happens to her and causes a real difficulty for praying specially out side the home and as you know women in this country go out of their home frequently. What is the judgment on these liquids (pure or inpure) and should she change the underwar every time!? and What is the status of her wudu?",,"Praise be to Allah.What is well-known is that the scholars say that everything that is discharged from the front and back passages is naajis (impure) except for one thing, semen, which is taahir (pure); apart from that everything else that has substance is naajis and breaks one’s wudu. On this basis, whatever fluid comes out of a woman is naajis and requires her to renew her wudu. This is what I understand after researching the issue with some scholars and consulting reference material. However, I did not feel entirely comfortable about this issue, because some women always have this discharge; if this is the case, then she should handle it as incontinence is handled: if she has wudu she should wash her private parts when the time for prayer comes, and be careful not to let the urine contaminate her. This is similar to the advice that the Prophet gave to the woman suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding).
Having also discussed the matter with some doctors, it is clear that if the discharge is from the bladder, the woman should do as described above; if it is from the vagina then she must perform wudu because of it, but the discharge is taahir and she does not have to wash her clothes if it gets on them."
443,1333,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1333,Munkar actions during mourning    ceremonies,"Question

                We would like to ask you to explain to us whether what we do during mourning ceremonies or obsequies is correct according to sharee’ah. We do the following:
We recite Soorat al-Faatihah over the grave of the deceased.
The offering of condolences may last for three days or more, and we eat and drink during the mourning ceremonies.
Twenty-five riyaals are collected from each person and the money is given to the family of the deceased.
We slaughter a sheep or similar animal three days after the death.
We gather pebbles whilst saying “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah” out loud, and put them on the grave of the deceased.
The women raise their voices, weeping and wailing, and they strike their cheeks and eulogize the deceased.
The women wear clothes of coarse black cloth as a sign of mourning.
The women do not do any kind of work during their ‘iddah period, such as preparing food or doing any other kind of work that is usually done by women.",,"Praise be to Allah.There are jaahili customs, or reprehensible innovations, and you have to give them up and explain to others that they are wrong.

With regard to reciting Qur’aan over the grave of the deceased, this is not permissible, and none of the Salaf did this. If it were good to do this, they would have done it before us. It has been reported that Soorat Yaa-Seen should be recited for the person who is dying, before his soul departs, but after he has died and when he is being buried and after the burial, there is nothing that should be recited, and one should not tell him to say “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah” and so on.


Offering condolences is Sunnah, but it need not be during the mourning ceremonies. Condolences may be offered to the family of the deceased in all places. There is nothing wrong with all the relatives of the deceased gathering together in one place so that people may come and offer their condolences, but they should not gather for the purpose of eating. Food should be prepared only for the immediate family of the deceased; it is makrooh for them to offer food to others.


There is no need to gather this money from everyone, unless the family are poor, in which case they may be given zakaat funds.


It is not permissible to slaughter this sheep, whether it is from the wealth of the deceased or from someone else. But if food is prepared for the family of the deceased, from one or more animals, there is nothing wrong with this.


Collecting these pebbles, and making dhikr whilst doing so, and putting them on the grave – this is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah) which must be given up and denounced.


Raising one’s voice in wailing and lamenting, striking the cheeks and eulogizing the deceased are all bid’ah and actions of the jaahiliyyah. It was reported in a hadeeth: “He is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and calls with the call of the jaahiliyyah.”

(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1294, Fath 3/163; Muslim, 103; Ahmad, 1/244).
Wearing black as a sign of mourning for the deceased is bid’ah; but the wives of the deceased should avoid wearing fancy or adorned clothes, jewellery, makeup and perfume during their period of mourning.
It is bid’ah for women to avoid their usual work and activities; the newly-widowed woman can still prepare food, clean the house, wash the dishes, do laundry, etc. There is nothing wrong with her doing that.

What is the Islamic ruling on such a person if he dies – can the funeral prayer be offered for him or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.Zakah is one of the pillars of Islam. If a person does not do it because he does not believe that it is obligatory, the ruling should be explained to him and if he persists, then he is a kaafir, and the funeral prayer cannot be offered for him and he cannot be buried in the Muslim graveyard. But if he does not pay zakah because he is stingy, but he believes that it is obligatory, then he is a sinner who is guilty of a major sin and he is a wrong doer, but he is not a kaafir.

What is the ruling on paying zakah on money loaned to a rich man who is delaying repayment? What is the ruling on a loan given to someone who one knows is rich and will pay it back – of course, after one year has passed?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the debtor is going through difficulty or is rich but is delaying repayment, and it is not possible to get the money back from him, either because there is not sufficient evidence to get the matter resolved through the courts, or because one has evidence but the authorities will not help him to get it back, as is the cases in some countries where the authorities do not support people’s rights, zakah does not have to be paid until the loan is recovered and one hijri year has passed. If, however, the debtor is rich and it is possible to recover the loan, then it is obligatory to pay zakah on the money each time a year passes, if the loan reaches the level of nisaab either by itself or when added to one’s other money and other wealth.

The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible?
This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase ‘So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. 
If we look at the reason why, Allah says, “Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So will you not then abstain?” 
We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden , because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.).
So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentage of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like.
And Allah knows best."
452,1377,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1377,Meaning of taghanni (‘reciting in a melodious voice’) in Qur’aan recitation,"Question

I have heard that there are ahaadeeth which indicate that it is allowed to recite the Qur’aan in a melodious voice (taghanni). How are we to understand these ahaadeeth?",,"Praise be to Allah.Reciting in a melodious voice (taghanni) may mean:
1 – Making the voice beautiful when reciting, whilst reciting aloud in a tone that conveys the feelings of humility, softening of the heart and sadness, without making too much effort or exaggerating.
Taghanni means reciting aloud, as it was narrated in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Allaah does not listen to anything (more approvingly) than He listens to a Prophet reciting the Qur’aan aloud in a melodious voice…”  This indicates that we are commanded and encouraged to make our voices beautiful when reciting Qur’aan.
This hadeeth clearly states the meaning of taghanni. The phrase “reciting aloud” explains it. Reciting aloud means raising one’s voice when reciting and making it beautiful, in a natural manner with no artifice, which one enjoys and finds pleasure in. Before the Qur’aan was revealed, the Arabs used to sing hudaa’ (songs of camel drivers) when riding camels, to make the journey pass more quickly when they were sitting in their saddles, and so on.
But when the Qur’aan was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to make them focus on the Qur’aan and raise their voices and make them beautiful when reciting it. He wanted that to take the place of singing, whilst paying attention to the correctness of the recitation. So in place of the pleasure of singing, they were given the pleasure of reciting Qur’aan, just as everything forbidden was replaced with something that was better for them. So istikhaarah was prescribed in place of seeking decisions from azlaam (arrows for divination) and marriage in place of fornication, and so on.
2 – It may be that what is meant by taghanni is that which resembles singing and music, and impressing others with the tune, without understanding and without any humility, as mentioned in the hadeeth which describes the Signs of the Hour.
3 – It is unlikely that taghanni means being content with the Qur’aan alone and having no need of people, because the meaning is different and is linguistically unacceptable.
This making the voice melodious in recitation should be done in a natural manner, not by means of teaching and training according to the rules of music.
Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned that reciting Qur’aan with a tune and in a melodious voice, if it is done naturally with no exaggeration or special teaching or training, then it is permissible. If extra effort is added to the natural tone to make it more beautiful, such as when Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “If I had known (you were listening), I would have made it more beautiful for you,” then that is OK. But if the reciting in a melodious voice is done in an artificial manner, with special training and musical rhythms, this is something which the salaf despised, and which they criticized and condemned. It is known that the salaf used to recite the Qur’aan in a sad tone, making their voices beautiful and giving it a sad tone sometimes and a joyful tone sometimes. This is something natural.
Defining the meaning of making the voice melodious (taghanni)
(a)I say: there is no dispute concerning the validity of the fatwa of Imaam Maalik which is based on the hadeeth of the Signs of the Hour, with its various isnaads, and which states that it is not permitted to recite with a musical tune and following the rules of music in a manner that goes beyond the limits of recitation and correct pronunciation, and does not befit the dignity of the Qur’aan.
(b)The ahaadeeth of Anas and Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) refer to the recitation of the Khawaarij, who used to recite the Qur’aan throughout the night and day, but it did not go any deeper than their throats or collar bones, because they did not have knowledge of the Sunnah which clarifies matters, so they were deprived of proper understanding and the reward for recitation. In the ahaadeeth it says that they would exit from the religion like an arrow passing through its target. The ahaadeeth contain the command to kill them and says that they are the most evil of creation, even though you would think that your prayer and your recitation are as nothing when compared with their prayer and recitation.  This is the description of the Khawaarij and those who are like them. Ibn Taymiyah said: the hadeeth about the Khawaarij is saheeh in ten different isnaads, which were narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, and some of which were narrated by al-Bukhaari. The Khawaarij used to denounce the Muslims as kaafirs merely for committing sins, but they were the followers of bid’ah (innovations) and misinterpretations who had split away from the mainstream of the ummah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in our religious commitment and their worldly affairs.
This is a description which applies only to the Khawaarij and those who are like them. The reciters nowadays are not like this as far as we know.
(c)The fatwa of Imaam Ahmad has to do with distorting the letters and exaggerating elongated vowels, which results from altering the letters and elongating them too much, which takes the recitation beyond what is correct. This fatwa states that it is emphatically disliked, as al-Qaadi Abu Ya’laa said. This refers to someone who goes to extremes and whose recitation is not correct, because he adds letters, such as adding waw and alif to the word Muhammad, making it Moohaamad. This is haraam, according to consensus. At the time of Imaam Ahmad, the people used to sing poetry and elongate the letters however they wished. Ishaaq al-Mawsili criticized Ibraaheem ibn al-Mahdi for doing that, because he distorted the words from the way they should be in Arabic.
And denouncing that in the case of reciting Qur’aan in a melodious voice is more essential, and this problem does not exist nowadays, praise be to Allaah.
(d)Ibn Taymiyah said: the kind of tune which the scholars regard as makrooh for reciting Qur’aan in is that which involves shortening long letters, lengthening short letters, giving a vowel to a silent letter, or making a vowelled letter silent, in order to make it fit the rules of music. If that also involves changing the way the Qur’aan should be recited and elongating the vowels, then this is haraam.
Reconciling between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed
There is no contradiction between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed if the prohibition applies to that which goes beyond the limits of correct recitation, whether by adding or taking away, or by neglecting an obligatory rule, or by going against the well-established rules of recitation. 
The prohibition also applies to that which is recited according to the rules of music, even if it is without the accompaniment of instruments, to make the voice tremble or quaver, or exaggerating in going along with a particular musical key which is in the reciter’s mind whilst he is reciting.
The permission applies only to that which is in accordance with the rules of sound recitation whilst making the voice beautiful. 
If what is meant by giving a tune is adding or taking away anything, or going against the well-established rules of recitation, this is haraam. If I mean making the voice melodious in recitation (taghanni), in order to make the listener feel happy or sad, or to soften his heart or to make the recitation attractive whilst also pondering the meanings and reflecting humility, then it is mustahabb, so long as it does not distort the meaning or change the pronunciation, or follow the rules of music.
Al-Suyooti said: Reciting Qur’aan with a tune and with beautiful, quavering voices, so long as it does not deviate from the correct way of reciting, is a good way (Sunnah hasanah); if it does deviate from the correct way of reciting, then it is haraam and is an evil deed. 
And he said in Sharh al-Risaalah:
From the comments of the imams it may be understood that making the voice beautiful whilst paying attention to the rules of music and also following the rules of recitation is an area that is subject to scholarly dispute.
Some of the scholars said that this is different from the way of the salaf, because the reader may neglect to recite properly, so they said that this was not permitted, in order to prevent the means that may lead to something haraam. 
But making the voice beautiful whilst reciting Qur’aan, without paying attention to the rules of music is what is required, and there is no dispute concerning this.
Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is mustahabb to read Qur’aan with a sad tone, with a measured pace and with a beautiful voice.
I say: this is taken from the hadeeth of Buraydah, “Recite the Qur’aan in a sad tone for it was revealed with sadness.” And the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas: “The best of people in reciting Qur’aan is the one who recites it in a sad tone.” But these hadeeths are both da’eef (weak) and the first one is da’eef jiddan (very weak)."

    The Names of Allaah mentioned in the Qur'aan and Sunnah number over one hundred, as
    several scholars have agreed (see Al-Qawaa'id al-Muthlaa fi Sifaat
    Allaahi wa Asmaa'ihi by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn 'Uthaymeen). 
Among these are ninety-nine
    names which, if one learns them and acts in accordance with them, will bring a great
    reward, as is indicated in the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased
    with him), in which the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: ""Allaah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one; whoever learns them will
    enter Paradise."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2736)
    The learning referred to in the hadeeth includes the following:
Memorizing them.

Understanding their meanings.

Acting upon them: so if a person learns
        that Allaah is al-Ahad (the One and Only), he will not associate anything else with Him;
        if he learns that He is al-Razzaaq (the Provider), he will not seek provision from anyone
        else; if he learns that He is al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), he will not despair of His
        Mercy, and so on.

Calling upon Allaah by these Names, as He
        says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong
        to Allaah, so call on Him by them"" [al-A'raaf 7:180] - so one might say
        ""Yaa Rahmaan arhamni (O Most Merciful, have mercy on me),"" ""Yaa Ghafoor
        ighfir li (O All-Forgiving, forgive me),"" ""Yaa Tawwaab, tubb 'alayya (O Accepter

                I would be very grateful if you could advise me on the fundamental differences between the main sects of Islam, although I know that originally Islam was a unified religion.
Thankyou.",,"Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question is lengthy and deserves a book to itself. We cannot answer in details here, but we can say the following in brief:
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us beforehand that this Ummah would be divided as the previous nations were divided, as stated in the saheeh hadeeth:
Wahb ibn Baqiyyah told us from Khaalid from Muhammad ibn ‘Amr from Abu Salamah from Abu Hurayrah who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and the Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects.” This was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sunnah, Baab Sharh al-Sunnah.
It was reported from ‘Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire.” It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they? He said, “Al-Jamaa’ah.”
Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 3982.
What is meant by al-Jamaa’ah is the ‘aqeedah and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions.
Among the sects that claim to belong to Islam are those who are misguided with regard to the Unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and His Names and Attributes; they say that everything that exists is Allaah and that He is incarnate or present in His creation – glorified be He far above what they say. On the contrary, He is above His heavens, settled on His throne, distinct from His creation.
Others are misguided with regard to eeman (faith) and say that deeds are separate from faith and that faith does not increase or decrease. The correct view is that faith consists of words and deeds; it increases when one does acts of obedience to Allaah and decreases when one commits sin.
Others are misguided by their declaring that the person who commits sin goes beyond the pale of Islam and is doomed to eternity in the Fire. The correct view is that the one who commits a major sin – apart from shirk and al-kufr al-akbar – does not go out of Islam.
Others are misguided with regard to the issue of al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar (divine decree), and said that man has no choice in what he does. The correct view is that man has freedom of will on the basis of which he will be called to account and will bear the consequences of his deeds.
Others are misguided with regard to the Qur’aan, and say that it is created. The correct view is that it is the words of Allaah, revealed not created.
Others are misguided with regard to the Sahaabah, whom they revile and denounce as kaafirs even though they are the companions of the Prophet among whom the Wahy (Revelation) was revealed, and they are the most knowledgeable and the most devoted in worship among this Ummah, and they strove in jihaad for the sake of Allaah and Allaah supported this religion through them – may Allaah be pleased with them all.
And there are other groups who deviated from the path of Islam and innovated matters in the religion of Allaah; each of them rejoices in what they have, but they have followed the ways of the Shaytaan and gone against the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-An’aam 6:153]
We ask Allaah to make us among the followers of the Sunnah who will be saved from the Fire, and to admit us to Paradise among the righteous. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

What do you give for Zakat Al-fitr? Is it money or grain? And what about if you don't know anybody to be given? Is it permissible to give it to the Masjid or a Kafir homeless, or Kair in general?","Zakat Al-Fitr must be given in food, not money, so we must adhere to what has been recorded in the Sunnah.","Praise be to Allah.Can Zakat Al-Fitr be paid in money?
Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made giving a Sa` of dates or a Sa` of barley as Zakat Al-Fitr an obligation for all Muslims, slave and free, male and female, young and old, and ordered that it should be given before the people went out to pray (Salat Al-`Eid) .” (Al-Bukhari, 1503)
Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We used to pay as Zakat Al-Fitr a Sa` of food or a Sa` of barley (which was their food at that time) or a Sa` or dates or a Sa` of dried yoghurt or a Sa` of raisins.” (Al-Bukhari, 1506)
From this, it is clear that Zakat Al-Fitr must be food, not money, so we must adhere to what has been recorded in the Sunnah. So give one Sa` of whatever is the staple food in your country, such as rice or wheat, for example, on behalf of yourself and each member of your household. (A Sa` is equivalent to approximately 3 kilograms). 
Can you give Zakat Al-Fitr to non-Muslims?
It is not permissible to give it to anyone except a needy Muslim . If you cannot find anyone in your own country, you can delegate someone else to give it on your behalf in another country. May Allah help us and you to do the duties that He loves.

Will Allah accept the prayer and good deeds of a person who is continually committing sin such as fortification even though in his/her heart the person is aware that he/she is sinning and is full of guilt and tries his/her very best not to continue committing such sin. Except for this weakness this person tries to be a good muslim e.g. never misses daily prayers, giving out time and money towards the cause of Allah, never taking alcohol or other un-halal foods etc.","Allah will accept whatever righteous deeds from one who commits Zina, such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his sincere repentance.","Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah.
Will Allah accept your good deeds if you commit Zina?
Allah will accept whatever righteous deeds from one who commits Zina , such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his repentance , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shu`ra’ 42:25]
But there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere . Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin.
Zina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).” [Al-Isra’ 17:32]
Punishment for Zina 
Married people who commit Zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment , which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a prohibited manner even though they were not without a halal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage). 
Unmarried people who commit Zina, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in Shari`ah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime.
Punishment for Zina in Al-Barzakh
The punishment for those who are guilty of Zina in Al-Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself?
We ask Allah not to despise us and to accept our repentance; we ask Him to help us to do good and to avoid evil, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near."

Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that Tufayl ibn
    Amr al-Dawsi and his companions came to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, Daws have rebelled and
    disobeyed, so pray to Allaah against them. People said, Now Daws are
    doomed! He said, O Allaah, guide Daws and bring them here. (Reported

    refused. Today I called her and she said something about you that upset me. Pray to Allaah
    to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. So the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu
    Hurayrah. I left, feeling hopeful because of the Prophets prayer. When I got
    home, as I came near to the door I saw it was ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said,
    Stay where you are, Abu Hurayrah! I could hear the sound of water. She washed
    herself, got dressed and put on her khimaar (head covering). Then she opened the door and
    said, O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, and I bear
    witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I went back to the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping with joy, and said,
    O Messenger of Allaah, good news! Allaah has answered your prayer and has guided the
    mother of Abu Hurayrah. He praised and thanked Allaah, and said, That is
    good. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, pray to Allaah to make my mother and me
    dear to His believing slaves, and to make them dear to us. The Messenger of Allaah
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, O Allaah, make this slave of
    Yours (meaning Abu Hurayrah) and his mother dear to Your believing slaves, and make the
    believers dear to them. There is no believer who hears of me or sees me, but he
    loves me. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4546).

    Allaah, we have suffered much from the arrows of Thaqeef (this was when they were
    fighting, before they became Muslim), so pray to Allaah against them. He said,

      lie with abraham ,nonetheless not believe in the veracity of hebrew scriptures?",,"Praise be to Allah.Muslims believe in all the Prophets and Messengers without exception;
    whoever denies any Prophet is a disbeliever. Muslims believe in all the Books that were
    revealed by Allaah to His Prophets, without exception; whoever denies any Book is a
    disbeliever.
On this basis, Muslims believe in Moosa (Moses) as a Prophet from
    Allaah, and in the original Torah as a Book from Allaah, and in ‘Eesa (Jesus) as a
    Prophet from Allaah, and in the original Gospel as a Book from Allaah.
When the previous books were distorted and altered because of
    men’s desires and division among the Jews and Christians, it was no longer possible
    to rely on them. Allaah abrogated all previous laws (sharee’ahs) when Islam came, and
    all previous Books when the Qur’aan was revealed. When He sent Muhammad 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as the final Messenger and Seal of the Prophets, it
    became obligatory to believe in and follow the Qur’aan which was revealed to him,
    especially since Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan and protect it from
    alteration and distortion, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily We:
    it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard
    it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]
Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is the Khaleel (Friend) of Allaah, the
    Father of the Prophets and the pride of the Muslims. Allaah sent him with the message of
    Tawheed (Divine unity) just as He sent Moosa, ‘Eesa and Muhammad (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon them all). The happiest of mankind is one who follows his way, which is
    Tawheed (belief in Divine unity).
Because both the Jews and Christians claimed that Ibraaheem belonged to
    them, Allaah explained that they were both wrong, giving decisive historical evidence in
    the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you
    dispute about Ibraaheem, while the Tawraat and the Injeel were not revealed till after
    him? Have you then no sense?
Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have no
    knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that which you have no knowledge? It is
    Allaah Who knows, and you know not.
Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim
    haneefa (Islamic monotheism – worshipping none but Allaah alone), and he was not of
    al-mushrikoon (polytheists).
Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibraaheem are those
    who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad 
 (peace andb lessings of Allaah be upon
    him) and those who have believed (Muslims). And Allaah is the Wali (Protector and Helper)
    of the believers.”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:65-68]
Become Muslim and you will be saved. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord
    of the Worlds."

    upholding the ties of kinship for females","Question

                my sister who has shahada is married
      to a man who is not, at the time she didn;t know that he is haram for her. My husband will
      not allow me to visit her home because he is not muslim, it this allowed? I would just
      visit her home when he is not there",,"Praise be to Allah.There follow some details about the issue of women
    upholding their ties of kinship, and what they should do with husbands who prevent them
    from doing so.
Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even for females, who must
    uphold them as much as they can. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to prevent his
    wife or daughter from upholding her ties of kinship, and if he stops her from visiting
    them, but he lets her convey greetings to them, whether by letter or through a third
    person, or send them gifts, then she should do that. It is sufficient even if she only
    sends greetings without a gift, but if she sends her greetings with a gift, that is
    better. If he stops her from sending a gift but allows her to send greetings, then she
    should send greetings. If he allows her to send a gift but stops her from sending
    greetings, then she should send a gift. If he allows her to go and see them, then she
    should go. If he stops her from doing anything that comes under the heading of upholding
    ties of kinship, then there is no obedience to any created being if it involves
    disobedience to the Creator. In this case she should maintain her family ties in the way
    that is least objectionable to her husband or father, whether it is sending gifts or
    conveying greetings, and she can conceal that if she is fearful. If her relatives are
    faced with some hardship, she should help them with what they need, even if he says not
    to. She should uphold her family ties by offering condolences in the case of bereavement
    or loss, and condolence means advising patience. She should also congratulate them on
    joyful occasions, and congratulating them means praying that they will enjoy to the full
    whatever has brought them joy, and that it will not be spoilt for them. Such joyful events
    include the return of a traveller, a wedding, etc. She should not adorn herself or display
    her adornment in front of those to whom she should not show herself, such as cousins (sons
    of maternal uncles or paternal uncles), and she should convey her greetings to them from
    behind a barrier and without making her voice soft, but this is only in cases where there
    is no fear of fitnah, otherwise she may convey greetings through a third party. She does
    not have to attend funerals.
It is not permissible for the husband to stop his wife from upholding the
    ties of kinship even if it involves her going out, but she should not go out except with
    his permission. The same applies to fathers. The wife should treat her husband gently so
    that she will still be able to fulfil her shar’i duty of upholding the ties of
    kinship. We ask Allaah to put all our affairs in order."

 The dove

      birds that Allaah has permitted us to eat, just like any other permissible
      bird.

      Is there any difference between this and saying to the occupant of a grave, ‘O So and
      so, help me!’?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to ask Allaah by the virtue of
    anyone, not even by the virtue of the Prophets or Messengers or awliyaa’ or righteous
    people. No one can compel Allaah to do anything. It is not permissible to ask Him in any
    way except by His Names and Attributes, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call
    on Him by them” [al-A’raaf 7:180].
With regard to saying to the occupant of a grave, “O So and so,
    help me,” this is obviously shirk, because it is a supplication to someone
    other than Allaah. Asking by the virtue of someone is a means to shirk, and calling

is: can I perform Hajj for her even though I have not yet performed
Hajj for myself?",,"Praise be to Allah.

I ask Allaah to reward you for your kind feelings towards your mother and your eagerness to perform your filial duty towards her after her death. In response to your question, if a Muslim wishes to perform Hajj on behalf of someone else, he must first have performed it for himself. The daleel (evidence) for that is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas, according to which the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) heard a man saying
“Labbayk (here I am) on behalf of Shubrumah” [i.e., he was performing Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah]. He (the Prophet) asked, “Who is Shubrumah?” The man said: “He is a brother (or a relative) of mine.” He asked, “Have you performed Hajj for yourself?” He said, “No.” He told him: “Perform Hajj for yourself, first, then perform Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah.” (Reported by Abu Dawud in Al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Manaasik, Baab al-rajul yuhijj ‘an ghayrihi).
This is a saheeh hadeeth. I ask Allaah to forgive your mother and extend His Mercy to her, for Allah is the best of Helpers."

I am living in Oman, where women follow a practice of remaining in the house for 40 days following the birth of a child. I have asked several people about this. Most people do not seem to know if it is sunnah or not. If it is, I would like to try to follow the practice (I am in the 9th month of my 4th pregnancy).  However, I have also been told it is a bid'ah practice and therefore I should avoid it.  Please try to clear up this issue, which I have been researching for almost 6 years!","It is permissible in Islam for women to go out during the 40 days of nifas to any place she wants, so long as she fulfils the Shar’i conditions (i.e., hijab etc.)","Praise be to Allah.40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam
Forty days is the longest period that the woman in nifas can refrain from praying and fasting , so long as blood is still flowing. After that, she should do ghusl and pray, and consider herself to be in a state of istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding which is neither menstruation nor nifas) if the bleeding does not stop. 
Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the woman in nifas would sit (i.e., refrain from praying and fasting) for forty days…” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi). 
Can women go out during the nifas period?
With regard to the belief that a woman has to stay in her house for forty days after giving birth and not go out, this is a mistaken belief and women do not have to do this. It is permissible for them to go out during these forty days to any place she wants, so long as she fulfills the shar’i conditions (i.e., hijab etc.)

                Assalaamualaikum, I have heard that Noah's ark was found a few years ago using 
references from the Quraán as opposed to the bible. Is this true?",,"Praise be to Allah.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""The people of Nuh denied (their Messenger) before them, they rejected Our slave, and said: 
A madman! and he was insolently rebuked and threatened.
Then he invoked his Lord (saying): I have been overcome, so help (me)!
So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth.
And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs. So the waters (of the heaven and the 
earth) met for a matter predestined.
And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails,
Floating under Our Eyes, a reward for him who had been rejected!
And, indeed, We have left this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive 
admonition)?
Then how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings!""
[al-Qamar 54:9-16]
In his Tafseer, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""And, indeed, We have left 
this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)? refers to this story, 
which serves as a lesson."" It was also suggested that it referred to the ship or ark itself, which 
was left so that those who came after the people of Nuh might learn lessons from it and not 
reject the Messengers. Qutaadah said: ""Allaah left it in Baaqirdi in the Arabian Peninsula (a 
place in Iraq), as a lesson and a sign, so that the first generations of this ummah would see it. 
How many ships have there been after it that have turned to dust and left no trace!""
The apparent meaning is that this refers to ships in general, as in the aayaat (interpretation of the 
meaning):
""And an aayah (sign) for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nuh),
And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.""
Yaa-Seen 36:41-42]
""Verily! When the water rose beyond its limits [Nuhs Flood], We carried you [mankind] in 
the floating (ship that was constructed by Nuh).
That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) 
understand it.""
[al-Haaqqah 69:11-12]
Hence Allaah says here ""is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)?"" i.e., is 
there anyone who will remember and learn?
In his tafseer of the words ""We have left this as a sign"" Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on 
him, mentions three opinions:
1.	That Allaah has left this story as a lesson to those who come after the people of Nuh;
2.	That Allaah has left the ship of Nuh so that subsequent nations may see it and learn from it 
how Allaah saved the believers and destroyed the kuffaar.
3.	That Allaah taught mankind how to make ships and left this invention as a reminder of His 
blessings and how Nuhs children and the believers were saved by means of a ship like those 
which are well-known.
In any case, there is nothing that would go against either Islamic teaching or reason if Nuhs ark 
were to be discovered and if generations of mankind after Nuh were to see it, because it would 
be a sign to them. The issue would be how to prove that the ship discovered was really Nuhs 
ark; not everyone who finds an ancient ship and claims it to be Nuhs ark is to be believed.

  Know, my sister, that we should be careful about pictures of animate beings, 
  lest we do something that has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger. I 
  wonder what urgent need there can be for putting pictures of Muslims in children's 
  books. If we want to make the books attractive to them, there are plenty of 
  colours, advanced methods of printing and pictures of inanimate objects such 
  as trees, flowers, cars, houses etc., which can be used instead of pictures 
  of animate beings. As for useful books which we need to keep at home, like reference 
  books and dictionaries that may contain pictures that are difficult to erase, 
  we can keep them as long as we blot out any pictures on the cover. Whatever 
  does not need to be kept, like newspapers, should be disposed of after reading.
  As for the book ""Al-Halaal wa'l-Haraam fi'l-Islam,"" the author was 
  very lenient in a number of issues, may Allaah forgive him. Some scholars have 
  written refutations of this book, such as Shaykh Saaleh al-Fawzaan, who wrote

not knowing what she wanted. She took me by the hand and led me to the door of the 
house. I was out of breath and we waited until I had calmed down, then she took 
some water and wiped my face and head, then took me inside. There were some 
women of the Ansaar in the house, and they said: "" ‘Alaa al-khayri wa’l-baraka wa ‘ala 
khayri taa’ir (blessings, best wishes, etc)."" My mother handed me over to them and 
they tidied me up, then suddenly the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) was there. It was mid-morning, and they handed me over to him. 
At that time I was nine years old."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3605).
‘Urwah said: ""Khadeejah died three years before the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings 
of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah. He stayed alone for two years or 
thereabouts, then he married ‘Aa’ishah when she was six years old, and consummated 
the marriage when she was nine years old."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3607)
The phrase ""he married ‘Aa’ishah"" means that the marriage contract was drawn up; 
the marriage was consummated later on, when she was nine.
Muslim reports from al-Zuhri, from ‘Urwah, that ‘Aa’ishah said that she was taken to 
him when she was nine years old, and she took her toys with her. He died when she 
was eighteen years old. Muslim also reports a similar account from ‘Aa’ishah via 
al-Aswad. He reports from ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Urwah from his father that ‘Aa’ishah said: 
""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me 
in Shawwaal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwaal.""
‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old and 
consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, and she stayed with him for 
nine years."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4738)
Al-Bukhaari calls this chapter of his Saheeh ""Baab inkaah al-rajul wuldahu (or 
waladahu) al-sighaar (Chapter on a man marrying off his young children)."" The fact 
that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
"". . . and for those who have no courses [periods] [(i.e., they are still immature) 
their ‘iddah is three months likewise, except in case of death] . . ."" [al-Talaaq 65:4]
is an indication that it is permissible to marry girls below the age of adolescence. This 
is a good understanding, but the aayah makes no specific mention of either the father 
or the young girl. It could be said that the basic principle concerning marrying children 
is that it is forbidden unless there is specific evidence (daleel) to indicate otherwise. 
The hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah states that her father Abu Bakr married her off before the 
age of puberty, but there is no other evidence apart from that, so the rule applies to all 
other cases.
Al- Muhallab said: ""[The scholars] agreed that it is permissible for a father to marry 
off his young virgin daughter, even though it is not usually the case to have intercourse 
with such a young woman.""(The above was summarized from Fath al-Baari Sharh ‘ala Saheeh al-Bukhaari)
In summary, then, it is permitted to contract marriage with a young girl and to hand 
her over to her husband to stay with him before she reaches adolescence. As for 
consummating the marriage, this does not happen until she is physically able for it. 
Thus the matter becomes quite clear. Do you see anything wrong with a man living 
with his young wife in one house, bringing her up and teaching her, but delaying 
consummation until she is ready for it? We ask Allaah to show us truth and falsehood 
and to make each clear. And Allaah knows best."

  women to cover their faces in Question #2198, 
  so please refer to that question.
With regard to the niqaab, this is a cover or veil

  women at the beginning of Islam, and it is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in 
  which he mentions what women in ihraam (for Hajj or Umrah) are not allowed 
  to do. He said: The woman in ihraam should not cover her face with a veil 
  or wear gloves. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1707). 
  Some of the scholars mentioned that a woman may uncover her left eye in order 
  to see where she is going, and if necessary she may uncover both eyes. The opening 
  should only be wide enough for the eyes, and the woman should beware of wearing 
  a niqaab with wide openings lest the beauty of her eyes becomes apparent and 
  the niqaab becomes a means of temptation instead of a veil covering her beauty 
  and adornment."
480,1497,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1497,Manners when talking to women,"Question

I have heard a ruling regarding the reasons a male Muslims is allowed to speak to a Muslim female and want to know if it is correct. It said that there are only five reasons one may talk to her:
1. to ask how her family
2. for medical purposes
3. for financial purposes (e.g. in a shop)
4. to find out about her personality for marriage suitability
5. to give her dawah (Islamic knowledge).
Is this correct? If it is, please provide the evidence from where the ruling is made (i.e. Daleel).",,"Praise be to Allah.The conditions for speaking to a woman to whom one is not related are mentioned in the following aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):
"". . . And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts . . ."" [Al-Ahzaab 33:53]
"". . . then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner."" [Al-Ahzaab 33:32]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer: ""This means that they should not speak softly. Allah commanded them to speak in a concise and decisive manner (i.e., they should be serious and brief in their speech, and not be vague or talk aimlessly). There should be no possible indication on the face that could be taken to indicate any softness in the heart, as the Arab women (before Islam) used to do when speaking to men, by making their voices soft like women who are taking care of small children, or like prostitutes. Allah forbade women to do that.
The phrase ""lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire"" means lest such a person should hope for immoral deeds, indecency or romance. ""Speaking in an honourable manner"" means speaking in a way that does not go against Sharee’ah or offend people. Women are encouraged when speaking to men to whom they are not related and to mahrams among their in-laws to be somewhat rough or abrupt in their speech, without raising the voice, because they are commanded to lower their voice.
Speaking with a woman to whom one is not related (i.e., not mahram) should only be for a specific need, such as asking a question, buying or selling, asking about the head of the household, and so on. Such conversations should be brief, with nothing doubtful in either what is said or how it is said.
The idea of limiting speech with women to the five instances mentioned in the question needs to be approached with caution, because they could be taken as examples instead of limits. One must also adhere to the conditions set out by the Sharee’ah even in instances where such conversations are necessary, such as in da’wah, giving fatwas, buying or selling, etc.

      whether he is a kaafir or a Muslim, should I say salaam to him or return his greeting or

    salaam to those you know and those you do not (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 12; al-Fath
    1/55) but this applies only to Muslims, or those who appear to be Muslim.
    It was also reported that it is forbidden to say salaam to Jews and Christians, because
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the
    greeting of salaam to a Jew or Christian, and if you meet them in the street, push them to
    the narrowest part of the road.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2167). He
    also said: “If the People of the Book greet you with salaam, say ‘wa
    ‘alaykum’ (and also upon you).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6258).
    But at that time the People of the Book were distinct
    from the Muslims in their dress and appearance, and they were not allowed to resemble
    Muslims. But in these times, unfortunately, many Muslims look like them, and we can no
    longer tell the difference between a Muslim and a Christian. Everyone - except for those
    whom Allaah wills – looks the same in dress, in being clean-shaven, in wearing
    nothing on their heads, or wearing western-style caps, so the matter is more confusing. If
    someone who looks like the mushrikeen says salaam to you, say “Wa
    ‘alaykum,” and do not initiate the greeting, because of the uncertainty about
    him. If he objects and tells you off, then apologize to him. You had reason to act as you
    did, because you did know whether he was a Muslim or a Christian, because he is not
    dressing as a Muslim and prefers the dress of the Christians and others. Tell him that
    “whoever imitates a people is one of them” (Saheeh, narrated by Imaam
    Ahmad, 2/50-92), and advise him to distinguish himself from the kuffaar and
    to dress as the Muslims dress, like his father, grandfathers and the scholars of the
    Muslims. If he persists in what he is doing, this means that he likes the characteristics
    of the Christians and is imitating them, and that he despises the Muslims and is going
    against them, even though he does not gain anything from that besides blind imitation.
    This indicates that he admires those kuffaar and thinks that their worldly achievements
    and inventions, etc., stem from their false religion. This is going too far, for the
    Muslims are wiser and more able to invent and produce, so he should not be deceived by the

484,1507,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1507,Why Is Interest Haram?,"Question

As we know interest is haram in Islam but can you please tell me why it is haram? I have some money but I don't know how to invest the money. There is someone who knows how to manage this money if I gave him my money and fix some amount for him as interest. We both agree on this and we are both pleased with this decision. Is it still haram? If yes, then can you please explain it for me?",Riba (interest) is haram because Allah has forbidden it. Mutual consent to commit a haram deed does not make it halal. So accepting interest does not make it permissible.,"Praise be to Allah.Why is interest haram?
Riba (which means adding something extra to certain products, like selling gold for gold, or by not receiving something when a contract is signed, or paying extra in return for extension of a loan) is haram because Allah - Who rules as He wills - has forbidden it. No one can ask Him about what He does; He is the One Who will ask people about what they did, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah has explained that riba is haram, and warned those who do not give it up, in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

""O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger . . ."" [al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
Does accepting riba make is halal?
One of the most important points to remember about Islamic Shari`ah - and this is one of the major differences between Shari`ah and earthly jahili laws - is that mutual consent to commit a haram deed does not make it halal.
If a man and a woman agree to commit zina (fornication or adultery), it does not become halal.
If a businessman agrees with the bank to deposit a sum of money in the bank and take interest on it, or to take out a loan and pay interest on it, that does not make such transactions halal. Things that are haram will remain so until the Day of Judgement.

Man is ignorant and inclined to do wrong. He may not even know what is in his own interests or in the interests of others, so he may do things that harm himself or others.

You state in your question that you want to give some money to a person to invest it, in return for something. There is nothing wrong with that if it is done in accordance with Shari`ah, which includes a contract of silent partnership - i.e., you give money to someone to do business on your behalf, in return for an agreed percentage of the profits.

According to Shari`ah, a contract of silent partnership includes the following:

The one who receives the money for investment is not permitted to guarantee the capital and is not expected to repay it except in cases of recklessness or negligence.
In the event of loss, the investor loses his capital and the one who took the money loses the time and effort invested.

May Allah help you and us to earn a halal income.

          against the teachings of sharee’ah and is contrary to the justice and 
          fairness that Allaah has enjoined, especially among one's children. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There 
          is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents 
          and those nearest related, whether, the property be small or large — 
          a legal share” 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:7]  
          
Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); 
          
“Allaah 
          commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, 
          a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, 
          two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, 
          her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each 
          if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the 
          (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers 
          or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases 
          is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You 
          know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest 
          to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allaah. And 
          Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise” 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:11]  
          
Then Allaah warns those who go against this 
          division of legacies and play with it, by saying (interpretation of 
          the meaning); 
“And 
          whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses 
          His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he 
          shall have a disgraceful torment”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:14]  
Whoever deprives some of his children of their 
          inheritance, or gives some of them less than is their shar’i due, or 
          gives some more than is their shar’i due, or includes someone who is 
          not an heir among those who are given his legacy, is a sinner who is 
          guilty of committing a major sin. Also, it is not permissible to make 
          a will concerning one’s heir, because he has a share which is defined 
          by sharee’ah. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy 
          on them) narrated from Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
          that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has given everyone 
          who is entitled his rights, so there is no will concerning the heir.” 
          (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2046).  
          
If it is proven according to sharee’ah that 
          one of the children is a kaafir, e.g. by the fact that he does not pray, 
          at the time of the father’s death, then he is not an heir, even if instructions 
          to that effect are not mentioned in the will, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not 
          inherit from the kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.” 
          (Saheeh – agreed upon).  
With regard to giving a gift to one of one's 
          children and not to the others for no shar’i reason, this is haraam 
          and is unfair, as it creates hatred in the children’s hearts towards 
          one another. The evidence (daleel) that it is forbidden is the hadeeth 
          narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on them) from 
          al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him), that his father 
          came to the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I have given this son of 
          mine one of my slaves.” The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Have you given all 
          your children a similar gift?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it 
          back.” According to the version narrated by Muslim, he said: “Fear Allaah 
          and treat your children fairly.” So my father took back his gift.  
          
According to another version, he (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) said: “My father took me to the Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, bear witness that I have 
          given al-Nu’maan such-and-such of my wealth.’ He said, ‘Have you given 
          all your children something similar to what you have given to al-Nu’maan?’ 
          He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then let someone else bear witness.’ Then he 
          said, ‘Would you not like all your children to honour you equally?’ 
          He said, ‘Of course.’ He said, ‘Then you should not do that.’” (Muslim, 
          3059).  
But if the gift is being given to one of the children 
          for a shar’i reason, such as the child being poor, or in debt, or needing 
          medical treatment, then there is nothing wrong with that. And Allaah 
          knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad, and grant him peace."

I committed a sin in their house before, and before this dream, I was always worrying that they might find out through a dream. How do I know for sure if I saw the Prophet in this dream?
This is worrying me very much. Also, I just had a dream, where I thought it was the Prophet again, during his last recitation of the Quran to Jibreel (AS) during Ramadan. Zaid (RA) was there, too, but also Hamzah (RA) was there in my dream. I know that Hamzah (RA) wasn't really there, because he was martyred at Uhud. So was this the Prophet in this dream?

487,1513,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1513,Doctor's Knowledge of the Fetus,"Question

                Is the doctors knowledge of the fetus in the uterus complete?",,"Praise be to Allah.
Imaam Abu Abdullaah Muhammad ibn Ismaaeel al-Bukhaari reported, in al-Jaami al-Saheeh, 
which is the soundest book after the Quraan:
""Ibraaheem ibn al-Mundhir told me that Man told us that Maalik told me, from Abdullaah ibn 
Deenaar from Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The keys of the Unknown are five, which no-one knows 
except Allaah: no-one knows what will happen tomorrow except Allaah; no-one knows what is 
in the wombs except Allaah; no-one knows when it will rain except Allaah; no-one knows in 
which land he will die; and no-one knows when the Hour will begin except Allaah."" (Saheeh 
al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, hadeeth no. 4328).
He also reported it with the wording: ""The keys of the Unseen are five: Verily, Allah! With 
Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He send down the rain, and knows that which is 
in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what 
land he will die. Verily Allaah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things) [Luqmaan 31:34]."" 
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, Baab (wa indahu mafaatih al-ghaybi laa yalamu illaa huwa), 
hadeeth no. 4261).
Allaah is the only One Who has knowledge of the Unseen, as He says (Interpretation of the 
meaning) : 
""Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen except Allaah . . ."" [al-Naml 
27:65] The Unseen referred to in this aayah is the same as that described in Soorat Luqmaan 
(see quote in preceding paragraph).
There is no doubt whatsoever that this hadeeth is saheeh. What has confused the questioner is 
the fact that doctors are able to know the gender of the foetus via x-rays and ultrasound scans, 
but we should note that this knowledge is vague and incomplete. They may make mistakes, as 
has happened on numerous occasions. Moreover, they can only perform these scans etc. after 
a certain number of weeks of pregnancy have passed, and not before. Even if they know 
whether the foetus is male or female, they do not know whether it will be miscarried or carried 
to term, whether it will be born alive or dead. They do not know the precise length of time that 
it will stay in its mothers womb. They have nothing but conjecture and uncertainties. They do 
not know how long this person will live, how he will behave or what his provision will be, or 
whether he will be of the people of Paradise or the people of Hell. Knowledge of what is in the 
wombs is not merely a matter of knowing whether the foetus is male or female; it is broader 
than that, and no-one can know it all except Allaah, as He says (Interpretation of the meaning):
""Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. 
Everything with Him is in (due) proportion."" [al-Rad 13:8]
In his Tafseer of this aayah, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""Allaah is telling 
us here of His complete knowledge: nothing is hidden from Him and He knows fully what the 
females of every species carry in their wombs. He says (Interpretation of the meaning): (He) 
knows that which is in the wombs, i.e., He knows whether it is male or female, good or bad, 
destined for Paradise or doomed to Hell, whether its life will be long or short. Similarly He says 
(Interpretation of the meaning): He knows you well when He created you from the earth, and 
when you were foetuses in your mothers wombs [al-Najm 53:32]
In the two Saheehs there is a report from Ibn Masood, who said: The Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ""The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in 
your mothers womb for forty days and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot and 
then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the 
spirit into him and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, 
his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy."" According to another hadeeth, the 
angel says: O Lord, male or female? Wretched or happy? How much provision? How long a 
life span? and he writes that.""
Al-Awfi said, from Ibn Abbaas: ""and by how much the wombs fall short"" refers to 
miscarriage, and or exceed means how how far beyond the normal time the pregnancy will 
last before a child is born, because some women carry a child for ten months and some for 
nine months; the length of pregnancy varies from woman to woman. This is what is referred to 
here. Al-Dahhaak said, from Ibn Abbaas, that this phrase referred to pregnancies longer or 
shorter than nine months.""
Every Muslim must believe in what the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) has told us, and 
not doubt a single word of it, because what the Prophet says is wahy (revelation) revealed to 
him by Allaah:
""By the star when it goes down, your companion (i.e., Muhammad) has neither gone astray 
nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only an Inspiration [wahy] that is 
inspired."" [al-Najm 53:1-4]
Whoever doubts what the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said or doubts that it is wahy is 
a kaafir who has left Islam.
The Muslim must believe that what the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said is absolutely 
true. This is shown in the hadeeth of Abdullaah ibn Amar, who said: ""I used to write down 
everything that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because I 
wanted to memorize it. Quraysh told me not to do that and said: Are you writing everything 
down that you hear? The Messenger of Allaah is only a man who may speak when he is angry 
or happy. So I stopped writing things down, and I mentioned this to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). He pointed to his mouth and said: Write; by the One in Whose 
hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it (my mouth) but the truth."" (Reported by Abu Dawud, may 
Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Ilm, hadeeth no. 3161, see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 1196).
We ask Allah to protect us from the whispers of Shaytaan and to give us strength of faith. May 
Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

Is setting a date to meet and read the entire Quran for a deceased person and to pray for him, and doing this every year a bid‘ah.?",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no indication in either the Quran or the Sunnah that would prescribe the actions described in the question. Based on this fact, these actions are bid‘ah (a reprehensible innovation) which is not permitted; we should avoid it and warn others not to do it. The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to say in his khutbahs (sermons): ""The truest of speech is the Book of Allah, the best guidance is that of Muhammad and the worst of things are those which are newly invented. Every newly-invented thing is a bid‘ah, every bid‘ah is a going astray, and every going astray will end in the Fire of Hell."" (Reported by al-Nisaa’i, may Allah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab salaat al-‘eidayn, no. 1560).
 
It is permissible to pray for the deceased, without arranging a formal gathering, and without setting a specific date for doing so. We ask Allah to help us and you to do that which He loves and which will please Him.

                What is the symbolism behind the
      Muslim star and crescent? I did a keyword search of your site and searched my library's
      reference books and cannot find anything more than a reference to the flag of the Ottoman
      Empire. Thank you for your interest.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no basis in shareeah for taking the crescent or star as
    a symbol of the Muslims. This was not known at the time of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), or at the time of the Khulafa al-Raashidoon (the
    first four leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him), or during the time of the Umawis (Umayyad dynasty). It emerged some time
    after that, and historians differ as to when this symbol was first adopted and who was the
    first to adopt it. Some say it was the Persians, others say it was the Greeks, and that
    this symbol was somehow passed to the Muslims. (See Al-Taraateeb al-Idaariyah
    by al-Kittaani, 1/320). It was said that the reason why the Muslims adopted
    the crescent was that when they conquered some western countries, the churches there had
    crosses on top of them, the Muslims replaced the crosses with these crescents, and the
    practice spread in this way. Whatever the case, symbols and banners must be in accordance
    with the teachings of Islam, and as there is no evidence that this symbol is prescribed by
    Islam, it is better not to use it. Neither the crescent nor the star are symbols of the
    Muslims, even though some Muslims may use them as symbols. 
    As regards what Muslims think about the moon and the stars, they
    believe that they are part of the creation of Allaah, and as such can neither benefit nor
    harm people, and they do not have any influence over events on earth. Allaah has created
    them for the benefit of mankind, an example of which is seen in the aayah or verse of the
    Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):
They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are
    signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage
    [al-Baqarah 2:189]
[The commentator] Ibn Katheer said, explaining the phrase Say: these
    are signs to mark fixed periods of time: From them (the new moons) they may know
    the times for repaying loans, the iddah (waiting period) of their women
    [after being divorced or widowed] and the timing of their Hajj (pilgrimage) Allaah
    has made them signs to mark the times when Muslims should start to fast and break their
    fast [the beginning and end of Ramadaan], to count the iddah of their women
    and to know the times for repaying loans. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).
    [Another commentator] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on
    him) said in his commentary on this aayah [verse]: This explains the wisdom behind
    the waxing and waning of the moon, which is to avoid any confusion in appointed dates,
    dealings, oaths, Hajj, iddah, fasting, breaking fasts, length of pregnancy,
    rentals and other matters that concern mankind. Similar to this aayah are others
    (interpretation of the meanings): 
And We have appointed the night and the day as two aayaat
    (signs). Then, We have made dark the sign of the night while We have made the sign of day
    illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of
    the years and the reckoning [al-Isra 17:12]
It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light
    and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the
    reckoning [Yoonus 10:5]
Counting the new moons is easier than counting days. (See Tafseer
    al-Qurtubi).
    With regard to the stars, the scholars of Islam say that
    Allaah created these stars for three reasons: to adorn the heavens, to drive away the
    devils (shayaateen) and as signs for navigation. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari,
    Kitaab Bad al-Khalq), as Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning): 
    It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide
    your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea
    [al-Anaam 6:97]
And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We
    have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the shayaateen (devils), and have
    prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire. [al-Mulk 67:5]"

    swear, O Lord, that You should send down rain, or defeat the Jews, or make So and so
    rich, or give him such and such, or do for me what I ask in this place, and so on. This
    implies that a person is obliging his Lord to do something, but it is Allaah Who controls
    the affairs of His slaves, and His slave has no right to make demands of his Lord or try
    to oblige Him to do anything. This goes against Tawheed, or it either compromises its
    integrity or uproots it altogether, depending on the persons intentions. The reports
    about some of the Salaf insisting by an oath that Allaah should do something probably
    refer to their duaas (supplications). The hadeeth of the Prophet

    is based on the lunar months, which are clear and can be readily observed by anyone who

What is the ruling on a person who does not fast according to the first sighting of the new moon of Ramadan, but waits until he sees it for himself? Is their interpretation of hadeeth, “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it” correct??",,"Praise be to Allah.What is obligatory is to fast when the sighting of the moon is confirmed, even if it is seen by only one trustworthy Muslim, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) issued orders to fast when a Bedouin testified that he had seen the new moon. Interpreting the hadeeth “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it” as meaning that no individual should fast until he sees the new moon for himself is incorrect, because the hadeeth is telling everyone to fast when the sighting is confirmed, even if only one trustworthy Muslim sees the new moon.
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/94).
Further evidence that the sighting of the new moon by one trustworthy, reliable Muslim is sufficient for fasting to be obligatory on all the people is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The people went out to sight the new moon and I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that I had seen it, so he fasted and told the people to fast.”
(Reported by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sawm, Baab fi Shahaadat al-Waahid ‘ala ru’yat hilaali Ramadan).
Some of those who follow bid’ah delay fasting until after all the other Muslims have started to fast, because of their misguided belief that fasting is not obligatory on a person until he sees the new moon for himself. The ahaadeeth refute this, and we would ask them moreover: what are those who are blind or who have poor eyesight supposed to do? It is as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.” [al-Hajj 22:46].

Please, visit the following web-site,
XXXX it is concerning Hilal sighting and calculation, they claimed that in XXXX they never sight the moon and every thing run according to astronomy calculations.
My question, Is this information is right or worng, and what is the real authentic way to decied the begining of Hajrii moneth?",,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is easy and its rules apply to everyone, mankind and jinn alike, regardless of whether they are scholars or illiterate, settled or nomadic. So Allaah made it easy for them to know the times for the acts of worship, and made their beginning and end signs which everyone can know. He made the setting of the sun the sign for the beginning of Maghrib and the end of ‘Asr, and He made the disappearance of the red glow in the sky the sign of the beginning of the time of ‘Isha’. He made the sighting of the moon after its disappearance at the end of the month the sign of the beginning of the new lunar month and the end of the previous month. He did not give us the task of knowing the beginning of the lunar month from something which is known to only a small number of people, namely astronomy and its calculations. Thus the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah make the actual sighting of the new moon the signal for the Muslims to start fasting Ramadaan; they stop fasting when they see the new moon of Shawwaal; the dates of Eid al-Adhaa and Yawm ‘Arafaat are similarly determined. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.”
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made the beginning of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Ramadaan, and the ending of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Shawwaal; he did not connect this to calculations of the movements of stars or other heavenly bodies. This is how it was done at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), during the rule of the Khulafa’ al-Raashidoon, at the time of the four imaams, and during the three centuries which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said were the best. Referring to calculations of the lunar months to start and end periods of worship, instead of actually sighting the new moon, is a bid’ah (reprehensible innovation) that has no good in it and has no basis in sharee’ah. The best of all is to follow the salaf in religious matters, and the worst of all is to follow newly-invented innovations in religion. May Allaah protect us and you and all the Muslims from tribulation, both obvious and hidden."

    zoos","Question

                What is the ruling on visiting zoos with
      the aim of enjoying looking at the animals?",,"Praise be to Allah.On the basis of the opinion that it is permissible to
    keep animals in cages, visiting places designed for the purpose of displaying these
    animals to the public such as those known nowadays as zoos, for the purpose of enjoying
    looking at the different types of animals, is permissible.
It is no exaggeration to say that doing so is in fact mustahabb and
    encouraged, when the motive for this is to think about the creation of Allaah and His
    Signs by looking at these animals and finding out about their different ways of life and
    so on. This has a good effect on a person’s heart, namely it strengthens his faith in
    his Lord and in His exalted attributes, for example, His Power, Ability and Wisdom.
When we understand the good effects of visits to these zoos, the wisdom
    behind the Qur’aan’s call to think about the greatness and majesty of creation
    will become clear. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Do they not look in the dominion of the heavens and the earth
    and all things that Allaah has created…?” [al-A’raaf 7:185].
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Think about the signs of Allaah, do not think about Allaah.” (Reported
    by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu’ab, 1/136 and by al-Laalakaa’i in al-Sunnah,
    3/525. See al-Saheehah, 4/395).
    But we should not omit to note here the many wrong
    things that happen in zoos, such as mixing of men and women. Even in places where some
    days are set aside just for men to visit and other days just for women, there may be some
    women wearing types of clothing that it is not even permissible for them to wear in front
    of other women. We must therefore prepare da’wah programs to be carried out in these
    places so that we may fulfil our duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is
    evil, thus making sure that there is no room in these places for license and things that
    go against Islam. With regard to zoos in countries where it is not possible to achieve
    this kind of reform, Muslims should choose the most suitable time to take their children
    to the zoo; they should avoid places of evil and protect themselves and their children
    from seeing anything that could adversely affect their faith. And Allaah is the Source of
    Strength."

      her. But out of respect for his father he will anyway, unles I become a muslim.Then he HOPES his father will agree to our marriage.Once I knew this, I asked him, what his family would do if they found out
      he intends to marry a European girl.He could not really answer that question. Now my question is: Do you have any idea how the family might react, and
      is it likely that the father would agree if I am a muslim?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is difficult to say what their reaction will be. Most parents want
    their children to marry in accordance with their wishes, and in most cases they will have
    chosen a wife for their son from their own country, whose customs and tradition are closer
    to those of the society in which they live. The idea of their son marrying a western woman
    may be very strange for them and difficult to accept, especially if they have heard about
    the widespread promiscuity in the West and the freedom with which Western women enter into
    relationships. They may also want their son to be near them, and they may be afraid that
    if he marries someone overseas they will only see him rarely. They may warn him about the
    consequences of raising his future children in a non-Islamic environment. On the other
    hand, they might agree if they hear that their son is going to marry a decent, upright
    Muslim girl, especially if their son is going to stay on and work in the West after
    completing his studies, and if they give any weight to their son’s own wishes –
    which is a matter that differs from family to family.
Whatever the case, you will not lose anything by entering Islam, whether
    you marry this man or not. If you become Muslim and marry this man, after you both repent
    from the forbidden relationship, then you will have got what you wanted. If this marriage
    is not destined for you, then maybe Allaah will send you another good, clean Muslim man
    whom you can marry and be happy with. The most important thing here is that you understand
    that striving to please Allaah by following His religion is more important than all other
    considerations. In any case, we hope that you will become Muslim and that your hopes will
    be realized in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Thank you for your trust and your
    question."
500,1665,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1665,Is Marriage Compulsory in Islam?,"Question

Is it obligatory for a woman to get married?","Marriage is obligatory for a woman who is unable to feed or clothe herself unless she gets married or she fears falling into immoral acts if she does not marry. What a woman can do to fulfill this obligation is not to refuse marriage when a suitable, compatible man comes with an offer of marriage.","Praise be to Allah.When does marriage become obligatory?
In response to your question, we will look briefly at what some of the Muslim jurists have written on this topic. In Mawahib al-Jaleel it was said: 
“Marriage is obligatory for a woman who is unable to feed or clothe herself unless she gets married.” 
In al-Sharh al-Kabir, concerning obligatory marriage it says: 
“If a person fears that he may commit fornication, it (marriage) is obligatory on him.” In Fath al-Wahhab, it says: “For the woman who has (physical) desires, marriage is sunnah, just as it is for the one who needs maintenance and the one who fears being taken advantage of by immoral persons.”
In Mughni al-Muhtaj, it says: 
“(Marriage) becomes wajib (obligatory) if a person fears fornication… And it was said that it becomes obligatory if a person has made a vow (nadhr) to get married.” Then concerning the ruling with regard to women: “If she needs to get married, i.e., she has physical desires, or needs maintenance, or she is afraid that immoral people may take advantage of her… it is preferable (mustahabb) for her to get married, because this will protect her religion and her chastity, and she can enjoy what her husband spends on her, and other advantages.”
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni: 
“Our colleagues differed as to whether marriage is obligatory. The best-known opinion in our madhhab is that it is not obligatory, except when a person is afraid of committing a forbidden deed if he does not marry. In that case he should make himself chaste (i.e. get married). This is the opinion of the majority of fuqaha.”
When it comes to marriage, people are of three types, one of which is those who fear that they may commit forbidden deeds if they do not get married. It is obligatory for such people to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because it is obligatory for them to make themselves chaste and protect themselves from haram. 
In Subul al-Salam it says: 
“Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid said that some of the jurists said that marriage is obligatory for the one who fears sin or hardship (because of suppressing physical desires) and is able to marry… and it is obligatory for the one who cannot avoid fornication unless he gets married.”
In Badai’ al-Sanai’, it says: 
“There is no dispute that marriage is an obligation when desire is strong. If a person has such a strong desire for women that he cannot be patient, and he can afford to pay the mahr (dowry) and support a wife, then if he does not get married, he is a sinner.”
From the above discussion, we can see a number of situations in which marriage is obligatory. You might ask: “How can we imagine a woman fulfilling this obligation when usually it is the man who goes around knocking on doors looking for a partner? This is not the woman’s role.” The answer is: what a woman can do to fulfill this command is not to refuse marriage when a suitable, compatible man comes with an offer of marriage.
Status of marriage in Islam
Muslim women and men need to understand the high status which marriage has in Islam, so that they will be more keen to marry. There follows a useful summary on this topic by al-Imam Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him), from his book al-Mughni:
“The basis of the legislation of marriage is the Quran, Sunnah and ijma’ (consensus of the scholars). In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
‘… marry women of your choice, two or three, or four…’ [al-Nisa 4:3] 
and 
‘And marry those among you who are single and (also marry) the salihun (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves)…’ [al-Nur 24:32]. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men! Whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for this will lower his gaze and protect his chastity. Whoever cannot (get married), then let him fast, for fasting will be a protection for him.”(Agreed upon). 
There are many other verses and reports like these. The Muslims agree that marriage is legislated.
Ibn Mas’ud said:
“If I only had ten days left to live, and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I was able to get married, I would do so, for fear of fitnah (temptation).”
Ibn 'Abbas said to Sa’id ibn Jubayr: 
“Get married, for the best of this ummah are those who have more wives.” 
Ibrahim ibn Maysarah said: 
“Tawus said to me: ‘Either you get married, or I will say to you what ‘Umar said to Abu’l-Zawaid: There is nothing stopping you from getting married but either impotence or immorality!’ According to al-Mirwadhi, Ahmad said: ‘Celibacy has nothing to do with Islam. Whoever calls you not to get married is calling you to something other than Islam.’”
Benefits of marriage
Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him):
“The benefits of marriage are many. They include: protecting one’s religion and helping one to adhere to it; protecting and taking care of women; and producing offspring and increasing the ranks of the ummah, thus achieving the pride of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), etc.”
[Translator’s note: there is a hadith which indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of the large numbers of his ummah in the Hereafter, so Muslims are encouraged to marry and have many children.]
It should now be clear that the benefits of marriage are many. No wise Muslim woman would hesitate to get married, especially if an offer of marriage comes from a person who is strongly committed to Islam and is possessed of a good character and morals.
And Allah knows best."

                i would like information on majic (jadoo)
      what are the consequences and can people use it to kill people.",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is sihr that can kill. When discussing different
    forms of murder the scholars have mentioned that the person who kills another by means of
    a kind of sihr that usually kills should be executed (qisaas –
    retaliation), because he has killed by means of something that usually kills. Ibn Qudaamah
    said in al-Mughni (9/330): “The sixth kind: if he killed him by means of a
    kind of sihr that usually kills, then he has to be executed, because he has killed
    by means of something that usually kills, like killing by use of a knife. If he killed by
    means of something that does not usually kill or something that sometimes kills and
    sometimes does not, then he has to pay diyah (blood-money), but qisaas is not required,
    because he intended to do harm, and it is akin to beating someone with a stick (which may
    or may not kill).”
The ruling concerning the saahir (practitioner of sihr)
    in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/267) says that in the case where he killed a
    person by means of his sihr… the majority say that killing by means of sihr
    may be done deliberately, in which case qisaas is required. According to the
    Maalikis, evidence or a confession is required. According to the Shaafi’is, if the
    person whom the practitioner of sihr killed was his equal , then qisaas is required
    if the killing was deliberate, which may be proven by a confession on the part of the saahir,
    such as his saying “I killed him by means of my sihr”, or “I killed
    him with this type of thing”, supported by the testimony of two reliable witnesses
    who have practised sihr in the past but have now repented, who can confirm that
    this kind of sihr usually kills. If it is a type that does not usually kill, then
    the matter is more akin to manslaughter.
And Allaah knows best."
502,1672,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1672,Expiation for one who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan,"Question

My question is complex. First, during the first Ramadan that my wife and I were married, we did something that we are ashamed of and have sincerely repented for; and that is have intercourse while fasting. Unfortunately, this occured 2 or 3 times.
I have come to know that the correct action for this is to: first free a slave or second, fast for 60 days continuously. The first option of freeing a slave is not possible, so my question is about fasting.
I could fast for sixty days but since it is continuous, I believe that I would not be able to provide for my family (fasting weakens me, and my job is a physical one, without energy, It becomes unbelievably difficult). It is hard enough to make it through Ramadan and earn enough money ( with Allah's will) to provide for my family. What options are left to me. I am aware of the hadith were a poor man came to the prophet (pbuh) and he was given the options free a slave, fast, and he couldn't do either, so he was given dates to give to the poorest family, which was his, so he took them to his family. How does this apply to me? I alhamdulilah, am not rich, but am not poor either (mostly pay check to pay check) - my wife and I feel tremendous guilt about this. Please help! Also, if one is to fast is that 60 days for each time one had intercourse during Ramadans fast?",,"Praise be to Allah.Our advice is that you should try to fast the two consecutive months during cold or temperate days when the days will be shorter and it will be less difficult for you, or during the annual leave which your employer gives you, and other opportunities which you can make use of for this purpose. If you really and truly cannot fast, then it is permissible for you to feed sixty poor persons. You could give them food in stages – according to what you are able to do – until you have fed the complete number. Your wife also has to make a similar expiation if she was a willing partner in the act of intercourse during the day in Ramadan. If the number of times that intercourse took place happened on different days, then you have to offer expiation for each day on which the sanctity of the sacred month was broken. The author of Kifaayat al-Taalib said: “The number of expiations corresponds to the number of days, not to the number of times the act was repeated on one day before the payment of any expiation. This is by consensus (of the scholars).” It was said in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi: “It is not counted by the number of times a person ate or had intercourse in one day.” The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: “Expiation is counted by the number of misdeeds… (whoever had intercourse on two different days must pay expiation twice)… because each day is a separate, independent act of worship, so the expiation for both cannot be combined… If the act of intercourse happened several times in one day, the separate acts are not counted [i.e. one expiation is sufficient].” Allah burdens not any person, but that which he can bear.
The hadeeth to which you refer in your question was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man came to him and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed!’ He said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said: ‘I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: ‘Could you find a slave you could set free?’ He said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Are you able to fast for two consecutive months?’ He said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Can you feed sixty poor persons?’ He said, ‘No.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell silent. Whilst we were (sitting) like that, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought a container of dates. He said, ‘Where is the one who was asking?’ The man said, ‘I (am here).’ He said, ‘Take these and give them in charity.’ The man said, ‘Who is poorer than I, O Messenger of Allah? There is no household between the two lava fields (i.e., in Madeenah) that is poorer than my household.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled until his back teeth could be seen, then he said: ‘Feed it to your family.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, 1936).
According to a report narrated by Ahmad from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting in the shade of the fortress of Hassaan, a man came to him and said, “I have been burnt, O Messenger of Allah!” He asked, “What is wrong with you?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting.” She [‘Aa’ishah] said: that was in Ramadaan. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “Sit down,” so he sat down at the back of the gathering. Then a man came with a donkey on whose back was a basket of dates, and said: “This is my sadaqah (charity) O Messenger of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Where is the burnt one who just came?” He said: “Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “Take this and give it in charity.” He said, “Where should it go except to me and my family, O Messenger of Allah? By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot find anything for me and my family.” He said: “Take it.” So he took it. (al-Musnad 6/276).
We ask Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, to forgive us our sins and transgressions and to accept our repentance, for He is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful."

504,1684,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1684,Do Prophets sin?    Do they need forgiveness?,"Question

I have been told by someone claiming to be a Muslim that all God's prophets, including Mohammed, were without sin, (perfect), never requiring forgiveness. Is this a view held officially by Islam as a whole?",,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you for sending this question in an effort to find the right answer instead of merely accepting what you have heard from someone who claims to be a Muslim.
The ummah (Muslim nation) is agreed that the Messengers are infallible in carrying out their mission they do not forget anything that Allah has revealed to them except with regard to matters that have been abrogated. They are also infallible in conveying the Message they do not conceal anything that Allah has revealed to them, for that would be a betrayal and it is impossible to imagine that they could do such a thing. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not ,then you have not conveyed His Message [al-Maaidah 5:67]. If anything is concealed or changed, then the punishment of Allah will befall the one who is guilty of doing these things, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And if he [Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] had forged a false saying concerning Us [Allah], We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off his life artery (aorta). [al-Haqqah 69:44-46]. One aspect of infallibility is that they (the Prophets) do not forget anything of that which Allah has revealed to them, and thus no part of the revelation is lost.
[Al-rusul wal-risaalaat (The Messengers and their missions), Omar al-Ashqar, p. 97]
Omar al-Ashqar also said (op. cit., p.102): The Prophets and Messengers may also strive to find the right judgement in the situations with which they are faced, and they judge according to what they themselves see and hear they do not have knowledge of the Unseen. They may make an incorrect judgement, as happened to the Prophet of Allah Dawood (David), who failed to do so, and Allah helped his son Sulaymaan (Solomon) to come up with the right answer in that particular case. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: There were two women, each of whom had a son. A wolf came and carried off the son of one of them, who said to the other, The wolf has taken your son. The other said, No, he took your son. They came to Dawood to ask him to judge between them, and he ruled in favour of the older woman. Then they went to Sulaymaan the son of Dawood and told him what had happened. He said, Bring a knife and divide the child between them. The younger woman said, Do not do that, may Allah have mercy on you! He is her son. So Sulaymaan ruled in favour of the younger woman. (Reported by al-Bukhari).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this story: Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated that he heard a dispute going on at the door of his apartment, so he went out and told them: I am no more than a human being. Disputing parties may come to me, and one of you may be more eloquent and persuasive than the other, so I may think that he is telling the truth and rule in favour of him. Whoever has a judgement in favour of him to the detriment of a fellow-Muslims rights, this is a piece of the Fire let him take it or leave it.
When it comes to the idea of the Prophets committing major sins (kabaair), Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said (in al-Fataawaa, 4/319): The belief that the Prophets are free of major sins, but not of minor sins, is the opinion of the majority of Islamic scholars and of all (Muslim) groups It is the opinion of most mufassireen (commentators on the Quran), scholars of hadeeth and fuqaha (jurists).
With regard to whether it is possible for the Prophets to commit minor sins, in Lawaami al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (2/214), al-Safaareeni quoted from Ibn Hamdaan who said in Nihaayat al-Mubtadieen: They are infallible in conveying the commands and message of Allah, but they are not infallible in any other regard. They may make mistakes, forget things, or commit minor sins according to the most well-known opinion (of the scholars) but they will not be approved for these mistakes.
The majority of scholars take the following as evidence to support their claim that the Prophets are not free from minor sins:


Adams sin in eating from the tree from which Allah had forbidden him to eat. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And (remember) when We said to the angels, Prostrate yourselves to Adam. They prostrated (all) except Iblees (Satan), who refused. Then We said, O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you be distressed in misery. Verily, you have (a promise from Us) that you will never be hungry therein nor naked. And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the suns heat. Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that shall never waste away? Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts appeared to them, and they began to stick on themselves leaves from Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. [Ta-Ha 20:116-121]


When Nooh prayed for his kaafir son, Allah rebuked him for doing so, and taught him that this person was not a member of his family, and that this prayer was not a righteous deed on his part. So Nooh sought forgiveness from his Lord, repented and returned to Allah: Nooh said: O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers. [Hood 11:47 interpretation of the meaning].


When Dawood realized that he had been too quick to judge, without listening to what the second disputant had to say, he hastened to repent: and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. [Saad 38:24 interpretation of the meaning].


Everyone, even the Prophets, is in need of the forgiveness of Allah. Allah has blessed His Prophets by forgiving their sins, and He has blessed our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as He said (interpretation of the meaning): That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His favour upon you, and guide you on the Straight Path. [al-Fath 48:2]
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, in al-Fataawaa 10/296, Concerning the issue of forgiveness of the Prophets sins: Allah, may He be exalted, does not speak of any Prophet in the Quraan, except He also mentions repentance and seeking forgiveness. For example, Adam and his wife said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers. [al-Araaf 7:23 interpretation of the meaning]. Nooh said: O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers. [Hood 11:47 interpretation of the meaning]. Ibraaheem said: Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the Believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established. [Ibraaheem 14:41 interpretation of the meaning] and You are our wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who forgive. And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter. Certainly we have turned unto You [al-Araaf 7:155-156 interpretation of the meaning]. Moosa said: You are our wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who forgive. [al-Araaf 7:155 interpretation of the meaning]. Then he [Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him] gave further examples, but what we have mentioned here is sufficient.
And Allah knows best."

                It is allowed to translate the Qur’an to French, for example, to be read by the unbelievers meanwhile, Allah says?",,"Praise be to Allah.No translation can resemble the Qur’an in precision of expressions, highness of style, or beauty of composition. Nor is it possible to reflect the miraculous nature of the Qur’an, fulfill all its goals in illustrating rules, principles and etiquette or indicate the lessons and primary and secondary meanings deduced from it. Any one who tries to do so is trying in vain.
People of Knowledge can express what they have understood from the meanings of the Qur’an in other languages to help the speakers of these languages get the ideas, even though they are not ultimate. But this is not considered to be Qur’an; it could be classified as belonging to illustrations. Therefore, unbelievers can touch such books."
506,1692,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1692,What Are the Forbidden Names in Islam?,"Question

Are there any names which it is forbidden to use? If so, what are they?","There are names which we are forbidden to use such as names which belong only to Allah, names which befit no one except the Prophet, and names which imply enslavement to anything besides Allah.","Praise be to Allah.Forbidden names
Yes, there are names which we are forbidden to use, examples of which are as follows:

Names which belong only to Allah 

It is forbidden to use any name which belongs only to Allah , such as al-Khaliq (the Creator) and al-Quddus (the Most Holy), or names which do not befit any except Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (King of Kings). This is the consensus of the fuqaha.
Ibn al-Qayyim said that names which belong only to Allah include : al-Ahad (the One), al-Samad (the Eternal), al-Khaliq (the Creator), al-Razzaq (the Provider), al-Jabbar (the Compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Awwal (the First), al-Akhir (the Last), al-Batin (the Hidden) and Allam al-Ghuyub (the Knower of the Unseen). (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 98)
The evidence that it is forbidden to call anyone by a name which belongs only to Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (king of kings), may be seen for example in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him); in the version narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The most despised name with Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man called Malik al-Muluk. According to Muslim, he said, The man who will be most deserving of Allah’s anger and most evil on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who was called Malik al-Amlak. There is no King except Allah.
As regards using names that may be used for Allah or for others, it is permissible to use these names, such as ‘Ali (High), Rashid (Guide) and Badi’ (Innovator or Originator).
Ibn ‘Abidin said: “It seems to be the case that they are permitted, even if the definite article “al” is used. Al-Hasqafi said: What (these names) mean concerning us (human beings) is different from their meanings concerning Allah, may He be exalted.

Names which befit no one except the Prophet

It is forbidden to use names which befit no one except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as Sayyid Walad Adam (master of the sons of Adam), Sayyid al-Nas (master of mankind), Sayyid al-Kull (master of all), because these names, as the Hanbalis said, befit no one except him, (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

Names which imply enslavement to anything besides Allah

It is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything besides Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as ‘Abd al-’Uzza (slave of al-’Uzza a pagan goddess), ‘Abd al-Ka’bah (slave of the Ka’bah), ‘Abd al-Dar (slave of the House), ‘Abd ‘Ali (slave of ‘Ali), ‘Abd al-Husayn (slave of Husayn), etc.
It was stated in Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin that one should not be called ‘Abd Fulan (slave of so-and-so).
It says in Kashshaf al-Qina’: ‘They (the scholars) agreed that every name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah is forbidden, such as ‘Abd al-’Uzza, ‘Abd ‘Amr, ‘Abd ‘Ali, ‘Abd al-Ka’bah, and any other similar names, such as ‘Abd al-Nabi (slave of the Prophet), ‘Abd al-Husayn, ‘Abd al-Masih (slave of the Messiah).” (Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 5/268;Mughni al-Muhtaj, 4/295; Tuhfat al-Muhtaj, 10/373; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 3/27; Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 90)
The evidence that it is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah may be seen in the report of Ibn Abi Shaybah from Yazid ibn al-Miqdam ibn Shurayh, from his father, from his grandfather Hani ibn Yazid, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: A delegation came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he heard them calling someone ‘Abd al-Hajar (slave of the stone). He asked him, What is your name? and he said, ‘Abd al-Hajar. He said, No, you are ‘Abd-Allah (the slave of Allah). (Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/335)

Using names of idols

Using the names of idols that are worshipped instead of Allah.

Names of devils

It is forbidden to use the names of devils (shayatin), such as Khanzab and Iblis. It was reported that the Sunnah is to change names such as these.
Disliked names in Islam
Names that are makruh (disliked) may be categorized as follows:

Names that have bad or distasteful meanings

It is makruh to use names that have bad or distasteful meanings, or which sound odd, which would cause others to mock a person or would cause him embarrassment, in addition to being contrary to the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who taught us to choose good names.

Names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy

It is makruh to use names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy, which is a widespread problem in the naming of girls.

Naming someone after promiscuous actors and singers

It is makruh to deliberately name someone after promiscuous actors and singers who star in worthless entertainment shows.
One of the signs of empty-headedness and lack of pride in one's faith is the fact that after a show starring immoral women, people will compete with one another in naming their newborns after these women. Anyone who checks the names registered at the time of one of these shows will see that this is a fact. And our complaining is to Allah.

Names that convey any sense of sin

It is makruh to use names that convey any sense of sin and disobedience to Allah.
Foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers
It is makruh to use foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers.
The proud Muslim who is content with his religion will avoid this and not come anywhere near it. The temptation to use these names is very strong in our time, and a Muslim might pick up any name from Europe and America. This is the worst type of sin and a sign of humiliation and defeat. If this imitation of the unbelievers and using their names is merely the matter of whims and stupidity, it is nevertheless a major sin; if it is done because one actually believes these names are better than Muslim names, then this is a devastating blow to the foundation of faith. In either case, the person who has done this must hasten to repent, and changing the name is a condition of repentance.

Names of Pharaohs or other tyrants

It is makruh to use the names of Pharaohs or other tyrants.

Names that have any undesirable meaning

It is makruh to use names that have any undesirable meaning.

Naming people after animals

It is makruh to name people after animals that are known for their bad qualities. When the Arabs called their children by such names, it was because of good qualities that they noticed in them, and this was the desired meaning. So when they used the name Kalb (dog), it was because of the dogs alertness and ability to work hard; when they used the name Himar (donkey), it was because of the donkeys patience and forbearance, and so on This refutes the false arguments of the Shu’ubiyyah against the Arabs, as was explained by Ibn Durayd, Ibn Faris, and others.

Names which are composed of any word added to such words as al-Din or Islam

It is makruh to use any name which is composed of any word added to such words as al-Din (the Religion) or Islam, such as Nur al-Din/Nuruddin (Light of the Religion), Diya al-Din/Ziauddin (Brightness of the Religion), Sayf al-Islam (Sword of Islam), Nur al-Islam (Light of Islam), etc. 
This is because of the great status attached to these words, al-Din and Islam. Adding words to them to form names is an exaggeration which borders on lying, which is why some scholars said that this is haram, and the majority say that it is makruh, because it gives an incorrect impression which should not be given. The way this practice started was that these were titles which were added to people’s names, then people started to use them as names.
Names of this sort may be forbidden for two reasons. In a name such as Shihab al-Din, for example, the word Shihab means a flame, which comes from fire, then this is added to the word al-Din (which is inappropriate). This can lead to the use of strange names, as in Indonesia, where people use names such as Dhahab al-Din (gold of the Religion) and Mas al-Din (diamond of the Religion)!
Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), used to dislike being called by his nickname Muhiy al-Din, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to dislike being called by his nickname Taqiy al-Din, and he said, But my family gave me this nickname, so I am known by it.

Names which include the word al-Rasul

Names which include the word al-Rasul (the Messenger) are also makruh.

Names of angels

Some of the scholars regarded using the names of angels (peace be upon them) as makruh. Giving angels’ names to women is clearly haram, because it implies imitation of the mushrikin, who thought that the angels were the daughters of Allah, Exalted be He above what they say!

Names of Surahs of the Quran

Some of the scholars thought that it was makruh to give people the names of Surahs of the Quran, such as Ta-Ha, Ya-Sin, Ha-Mim. (The popular notion that Ya-Sin and Ta-Ha are names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not correct).

507,1693,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1693,Combining two intentions in one fast – the issue of overlapping acts of worship,"Question

Is it possible to combine the intention of fasting the three days in each month with the intention to fast the Day of ‘Arafaah? Will we receive two rewards?",,"Praise be to Allah.Combining acts of worship is of two types:
One type is not correct, which is in the case of acts of worship which are independent or are part of another. In these cases, intentions cannot be combined. For example, if a man misses the Sunnah of Fajr, and the sun comes up and the time for Salaat al-Duhaa comes, the Sunnah of Fajr cannot take the place of Salaat al-Duhaa, or vice-versa. They cannot be combined, because the Sunnah of Fajr is independent, and Salaat al-Duhaa is independent, and neither of them can take the place of the other.
The same applies if an act is connected to the one that comes before it – they cannot be combined. So if a man says, “I want to have the intention of praying both fard and sunnah when I pray Fajr,” we would tell him that this is not correct, because the Sunnah (of Fajr) is directly connected to the Fard, and cannot take its place.
The second type is where what is intended is not a specific act of worship. In this case, intentions may be combined. For example: a man enters the mosque where the people are praying Salaat al-Fajr. It is known that when a man enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he prays two rak’ahs, so if he joins the imaam in that prayer, this is good enough. Why? Because the point is that he should pray two rak’ahs when he enters the mosque. Similarly, if a man enters the mosque at the time of Salaat al-Duhaa and prays two rak’ahs with the intention of praying Salaat al-Duhaa, he does not have to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid as well, but if he has the intention of both, that is better. This is the guideline for combining acts of worship.
In the case of fasting, fasting the Day of ‘Arafaah, for example, means that when this day comes you will be fasting, whether you intended it as one of the three days which you fast every month or as the Day of ‘Arafaah. But if you intended it as the Day of ‘Arafaah, it will not count as one of the three days; but if you intended it as one of the three days, that is good enough and will count as the Day of ‘Arafaah too. If you intended both, that is preferable."
508,1695,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1695,Ruling on objects    made from animal skins,"Question

What is the ruling on using different kinds of animal skins, whether they come from animals whose meat we can eat or those whose meat we cannot eat, whether they are tanned or not tanned?",,"Praise be to Allah.The skins of animals that become halal through proper slaughter are pure (taahir), because they become good through the process of proper slaughter, such as the skins of camels, cattle, sheep, gazelles, rabbits and so on, whether they are tanned or not tanned. As for the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, such as dogs, wolves, lions, elephants and the like, it is impure (naajis), whether it is slaughtered or it dies or is killed, because even if it is slaughtered it does not become halal and cannot be good, so it is naajis, whether it is tanned or not tanned. This is according to the most correct opinion, because the most correct opinion is that impure skins cannot be made pure through tanning if they come from animals which we are not permitted to slaughter for food.
As for the skins of animals which have died before they could be slaughtered properly, if these are tanned then they become pure, but before they are tanned they are impure. So now animal skins may be divided into three types:
The first type: those which are pure whether they are tanned or not, which are the skins of animals that may be eaten if they are slaughtered correctly.
The second type: skins which cannot be pure either before or after tanning, because they are impure. These are the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, like pigs.
The third type: skins which become pure after tanning, but are not pure before before tanning. These are the skins of animals whose meat may be eaten if they are slaughtered properly but not if they die otherwise."
509,1696,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1696,What should a man say when he enters upon his bride?,"Question

                What is the Sunnah when entering upon one’s wife on the wedding night? Many people mistakenly think that he should read Soorat al-Baqarah and pray, and this custom is widespread nowadays.",,"Praise be to Allah.When a man enters upon his wife for the first time, he should take her forelock in his hand and say: “Allaahumma innee as’aluka khayrahaa wa khayra ma jabaltahaa ‘alayh, wa a’oodhu bika min sharrihaa wa sharri ma jabaltahaa ‘alayh (O Allaah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that You have made her inclined towards, and I take refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that You have made her inclined towards).” (Reported by Abu Dawood, no. 2160; Ibn Maajah, no. 1918), But if he fears that the woman may get upset if he takes hold of her forelock and recites this du’aa’, then he can take hold of her forelock as if he is going to kiss her, and recite this du’aa’ to himself under his breath, without letting her hear him, so that she will not be upset. If she is a woman who has knowledge, she will know that this is prescribed by Islam and that there is nothing wrong with him doing and saying this in such a way that she can hear it. As for praying two rak’ahs when he enters the room where his wife is, it was reported that some of the salaf did this, so if the man does this it is good, and if he does not do it, there is nothing wrong with that. As for reciting al-Baqarah and other soorahs, I know of no basis for doing this."
510,1698,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1698,Merits of Zamzam Water,"Question

Does Zamzam water have any significance? Is there any hadith to say it is used for cures, etc. and or keep niyyah and drink it for a purpose?","The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the water of Zamzam, “It is a blessing, and it is food that satisfies.” (in one narration, “and a cure for the sick.”)
When you drink Zamzam water, you should face the Ka`bah, say Bismillah, pause to take a breath three times, drink your fill, praise Allah after you finish, and sit whilst drinking.","Praise be to Allah.What is Zamzam?
Zamzam is the name of a famous well in al-Masjid al-Haram [the Sacred Mosque in Makkah], which is thirty-eight cubits away from the Ka`bah. It is the well of Isma’il, the son of Ibrahim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both), from which Allah quenched the thirst of Isma’il when he was an infant. His mother looked for water for him, but could not find any. She climbed to the top of al-Safa, praying to Allah to help her and give her water for Isma’il, then she climbed to the top of al-Marwah and did the same. Allah sent Jibril, and he struck the earth with his heels, and water appeared.
Virtues of drinking from the water of Zamzam
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) agreed that it is recommended for pilgrims on Hajj and `Umrah in particular, and for all Muslims in general, to drink Zamzam water, because of the authentic hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is reported to have drunk the water of Zamzam . (Al-Bukhari, 3/492) 
According to the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the water of Zamzam, “It is a blessing, and it is food that satisfies.” (Reported by Muslim, 4/1922). Al-Tayaalisi (61) added, in a version that he narrated: “and a cure for the sick.” I.e., drinking the water of Zamzam means that a person does not need to eat, and it will cure his sickness – but this is when he drinks it with faith and sincerity, as proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari who stayed in Makkah for a month without any nourishment except Zamzam water.
Al-`Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The people used to compete over Zamzam during the time of Jahiliyyah. People who had children used to bring them and give them to drink, and this was their early-morning victuals. We used to used to think that it was a help for people who had children.” Al-'Abbas said: “During the Jahiliyyah, Zamzam was known as Shaba’ah (satisfaction).”
Al-‘Allamah al-Abbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“(The water) is for whatever purpose it is drunk for, and Allah made it food and drink for Isma’il and his mother Hajar .”
Ibn al-Mubarak entered Zamzam and said, “O Allah, Ibn al-Mu’ammal told me, from Abu’l-Zubayr from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for,’ so, O Allah, I am drinking it (to quench) my thirst on the Day of Resurrection.”
The two angels washed the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was a child, after they had taken it out, then they put it back. Al-Hafiz al-'Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reason why the Prophet’s chest was washed with Zamzam water was to make him stronger so that he could see the kingdom of heaven and earth, and Paradise and Hell, because one of the special qualities of Zamzam is that it strengthens the heart and calms the soul. The report about the chest of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) being washed with the water of Zamzam is proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My roof was opened when I was in Makkah, and Jibril (peace be upon him) came down and opened my chest, then he washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith, poured it into my chest, and closed it up again. Then he took me by the hand and ascended with me into the first heaven.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3/429)
How to drink Zamzam water
It is sunnah to drink one’s fill of Zamzam water and to quench one’s thirst.
The jurists have mentioned the etiquette that is recommended when drinking Zamzam water, such as facing the Ka`bah , saying Bismillah, pausing to take a breath three times, drinking one’s fill, praising Allah after one finishes, and sitting whilst drinking it, as one should do when drinking other kinds of drinks. 
As regards the hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, “I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Zamzam water to drink whilst he was standing,” (reported by al-Bukhari, 3/492), it is taken to mean that it is permissible to drink whilst standing, and the disapproval of doing so is understood to mean that it is disliked. 
The scholars also recommended that the person who drinks Zamzam water should sprinkle some of it on his head, face and chest, make lots of du`a when drinking it, and to drink it for a purpose that will benefit him in this world or the next, because of the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 2/1018; see Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah by al-Sakhawi, p. 359)
When Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) drank from the water of Zamzam, he said: “O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge, plentiful provision and healing from every disease.”
Al-Daynuri reported that al-Humaydi said: “We were with Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah, and he told us the hadith about the water of Zamzam being drunk for whatever purpose it is drunk for. A man got up and left the gathering, then he came back and said, ‘O Abu Muhammad, is the hadith which you told us about the water of Zamzam sahih?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ The man said, ‘Just now I drank a bucket of Zamzam so that you would tell me one hundred hadiths.’ Sufyan said, ‘Sit down,’ so he sat down and he told him one hundred hadiths.”
Can you take Zamzam water back to your country?
Some jurists recommended that people should take some Zamzam water back with them to their countries, because it is a cure for those who seek healing. `Aishah reported that she took Zamzam water home with her in bottles, and said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took some of it away with him, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 4/37)
The jurists agreed that it is permissible to use Zamzam water to purify oneself , but they advised that it should not be used for any inappropriate purposes such as removing impurity and so on. 
Al-‘Allamah al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Kashshaf al-Qina’: 
“Only this (using Zamzam water to remove najasah) is considered to be makruh, out of respect, but it is not makruh to use it to purify oneself, because ‘Ali said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) departed (from Muzdalifah) and called for a bucket of Zamzam water. He drank from it, then did wudu. (Reported by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ahmad with a sahih isnad).” (See Nayl al-Awtar, Kitab al-Taharah, Bab Tahuriyyat al-Bahr).
Al-Hafiz al-Sakhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah:
“Some people said that the virtue (of Zamzam water) remains only so long as it is in its place (of origin), and that when it is taken away, it changes. This is an idea that has no basis. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote to Suhayl ibn `Amr: “If my letter reaches you at night, do not wait until morning, and if it reaches you during the day, do not wait until evening, to send me some Zamzam water.” He sent him two containers full, and at that time he was in Madinah, before the Conquest of Makkah. This hadith is hasan because of corroborating evidence. `Aishah also used to take Zamzam water away with her, and she reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do this; he used to carry it in small vessels and buckets, and pour it onto the sick and give it to them to drink. 
Whenever a guest visited Ibn `Abbas he would honour him by giving him Zamzam to drink. `Ata was asked about taking Zamzam water away, and he said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), al-Hasan and al-Husayn all took it away with them.”
And Allah knows best."
511,1699,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1699,Virtues of the Ten Days of Dhul Hijjah,"Question

How do the first ten days of the Month of Dhul Hijjah differ from other days of the year?","The virtues of the ten days of Dhul Hijjah are based on many things: 1- Allah swears an oath by them, 2- The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified that these are the best days of this world, 3- The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged people to do righteous deeds during them.","Praise be to Allah.Benefits of seasons of worship 
Praise be to Allah Who has created time and has made some times better than others, some months and days and nights better than others, when rewards are multiplied many times, as a mercy towards His slaves. This encourages them to do more righteous deeds and makes them more eager to worship Him, so that the Muslim renews his efforts to gain a greater share of reward, prepare himself for death and supply himself in readiness for the Day of Judgement.
This season of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s faults and make up for any shortcomings or anything that one might have missed. Every one of these special occasions involves some kind of worship through which the slaves may draw closer to Allah, and some kind of blessing through which Allah bestows His favour and mercy upon whomsoever He will. The happy person is the one who makes the most of these special months, days and hours and draws nearer to his Lord during these times through acts of worship; he will most likely be touched by the blessing of Allah and will feel the joy of knowing that he is safe from the flames of Hell. (Ibn Rajab, al-Lataif, p.8)
The Muslim must understand the value of his life, increase his worship of Allah and persist in doing good deeds until the moment of death. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty."" [al-Hijr 15:99] The commentators said: ""‘The certainty’ means death.""
Virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah
Among the special seasons of worship are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah , which Allah has preferred over all the other days of the year. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days."" The people asked, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?"" He said, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/457).
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""There is no deed more precious in the sight of Allah, nor greater in reward, than a good deed done during the ten days of Sacrifice ."" He was asked, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?"" He said, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing."" (Reported by al-Darimi, 1/357; its isnad is hasan as stated in al-Irwa, 3/398).
These texts and others indicate that these ten days are better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the last ten days of Ramadan. But the last ten nights of Ramadan are better, because they include Laylat al-Qadr (""the Night of Decree""), which is better than a thousand months. Thus the various reports may be reconciled. (See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/412).
Reasons behind the virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah
You should know, my brother in Islam, that the virtue of these ten days is based on many things:

Allah swears an oath by them, and swearing an oath by something is indicative of its importance and great benefit. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""By the dawn; by the ten nights"" [al-Fajr 89:1-2]. Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn al-Zubayr, Mujahid and others of the earlier and later generations said that this refers to the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Ibn Kathir said: ""This is the correct opinion."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/413)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified that these are the best days of this world, as we have already quoted above from sahih ahadith.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged people to do righteous deeds because of the virtue of this season for people throughout the world, and also because of the virtue of the place - for the Hujjaj (pilgrims) to the Sacred House of Allah.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to recite a lot of Tasbih (""Subhan-Allah""), Tahmid (""Al-hamdu Lillah"") and Takbir (""Allahu akbar"") during this time. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahlil (""La ilaha ill-Allah""), Takbir and Tahmid."" (Reported by Ahmad, 7/224; Ahmad Shakir stated that it is sahih).
These ten days include Yawm ‘Arafah (the Day of ‘Arafah ), on which Allah perfected His Religion. Fasting on this day will expiate for the sins of two years. These days also include Yawm al-Nahar (the Day of Sacrifice ), the greatest day of the entire year and the greatest day of Hajj , which combines acts of worship in a way unlike any other day.
These ten days include the days of sacrifice and of Hajj.

Things to avoid in Dhul Hijjah
Question: What must the Muslim avoid during these ten days if he wants to offer a sacrifice?
The Sunnah indicates that the one who wants to offer a sacrifice must stop cutting his hair and nails and removing anything from his skin, from the beginning of the ten days until after he has offered his sacrifice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When you see the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he should stop cutting his hair and nails until he has offered his sacrifice."" According to another report he said: ""He should not remove (literally, touch) anything from his hair or skin."" (reported by Muslim with four isnads, 13/146)
The Prophet’s instruction here makes one thing obligatory and his prohibition makes another haram, according to the soundest opinion, because these commands and prohibitions are unconditional and unavoidable. However, if a person does any of these things deliberately, he must seek Allah’s forgiveness but is not required to offer (an extra) sacrifice in expiation; his sacrifice will be acceptable. Whoever needs to remove some hair, nails, etc. because it is harming him, such as having a broken nail or a wound in a site where there is hair, should do so, and there is nothing wrong with that. The state of ihram is so important that it is permitted to cut one’s hair if leaving it will cause harm. There is nothing wrong with men or women washing their heads during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only forbade cutting the hair, not washing it.
The wisdom behind this prohibition of the one who wants to offer a sacrifice from cutting his hair etc., is so that he may resemble those in ihram in some aspects of the rites performed, and so that he may draw closer to Allah by offering the sacrifice. So he leaves his hair and nails alone until the time when he has offered his sacrifice, in the hope that Allah will save him in his entirety from the Fire. And Allah knows best.
If a person has cut his hair or nails during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah because he was not planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides later, during the ten days, to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails from the moment he makes this decision.
Some women may delegate their brothers or sons to make the sacrifice on their behalf, then cut their hair during these ten days. This is not correct, because the ruling applies to the one who is offering the sacrifice, whether or not he (or she) delegates someone else to carry out the actual deed. The prohibition does not apply to the person delegated, only to the person who is making the sacrifice, as is indicated in the hadith. The person who is sacrificing on behalf of someone else, for whatever reason, does not have to adhere to this prohibition.
This prohibition appears to apply only to the one who is offering the sacrifice, not to his wife and children, unless any of them is offering a sacrifice in his or her own right, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sacrifice ""on behalf of the family of Muhammad,"" but there are no reports that say he forbade them to cut their hair or nails at that time.
If a person was planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides to go and perform Hajj, he should not cut his hair or nails if he wants to enter ihram, because the Sunnah is only to cut hair and nails when necessary. But if he is performing Tamattu’ [whereby he performs ‘Umrah, comes out of ihram and enters ihram anew for Hajj], he should trim his hair at the end of his ‘Umrah because this is part of the ritual.
The things that are described above as being prohibited for the person who is planning to offer a sacrifice are reported in the hadith quoted above; the person is not forbidden to wear perfume, have marital relations, wear sewn garments, etc.
What to do in Dhul Hijjah
Concerning the types of worship to be performed during these ten days, one must understand that these days are a great blessing from Allah to His slave, which is appreciated properly by the actively righteous. It is the Muslim’s duty to appreciate this blessing and make the most of the opportunity, by devoting these ten days to paying more attention to striving hard in worship. Among His blessings to His slaves, Allah has given us many ways in which to do good and worship Him, so that the Muslim may be constantly active and consistent in his worship of his Lord.
Among the good deeds which the Muslim should strive to do during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are:
    1.Fasting.
It is Sunnah to fast on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do good deeds during this time, and fasting is one of the best of deeds. Allah has chosen fasting for Himself, as is stated in the hadith qudsi: ""Allah says: ‘All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I am the One Who will reward him for it.’"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1805).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah. It was narrated from Hunaydah ibn Khalid from his wife, that one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah and the day of ‘Ashura, and three days each month, the first Monday of the month and two Thursdays. Narrated by al-Nasai, 4/205 and by Abu Dawud; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/462.
      2. Takbir . It is Sunnah to say Takbir (""Allahu akbar""), Tahmid (""Al-hamdu Lillah""), Tahlil (""La ilaha ill-Allah"") and Tasbih (""Subhan Allah"") during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and to say it loudly in the mosque, the home, the street and every place where it is permitted to remember Allah and mention His name out loud, as an act of worship and as a proclamation of the greatness of Allah, may He be exalted.
Men should recite these phrases out loud, and women should recite them quietly.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""That they might witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e., reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice)..."" [al-Hajj 22:28]
The majority of scholars agree that the ""appointed days"" are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because of the words of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father): ""The ‘appointed days’ are the first ten days (of Dhul-Hijjah).""
The Takbir may include the words ""Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah; wa Allahu akbar wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great and to Allah be praise),"" as well as other phrases.
Takbir at this time is an aspect of the Sunnah that has been forgotten, especially during the early part of this period, so much so that one hardly ever hears Takbir, except from a few people. This Takbir should be pronounced loudly, in order to revive the Sunnah and as a reminder to the negligent. There is sound evidence that Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to go out in the marketplace during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, reciting Takbir, and the people would recite Takbir when they heard them. The idea behind reminding the people to recite Takbir is that each one should recite it individually, not in unison, as there is no basis in Shari’ah for doing this.
Reviving aspects of the Sunnah that have been virtually forgotten is a deed that will bring an immense reward, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Whoever revives an aspect of my Sunnah that is forgotten after my death, he will have a reward equivalent to that of the people who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 7/443; this is a hasan hadith because of corroborating asanid).
      3.Performing Hajj and ‘Umrah. One of the best deeds that one can do during these ten days is to perform Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. The one whom Allah helps to go on Hajj to His House and to perform all the rituals properly is included in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.""
    4.Doing more good deeds in general, because good deeds are beloved by Allah and will bring a great reward from Him. Whoever is not able to go to Hajj should occupy himself at this blessed time by worshipping Allah, praying (salah), reading Quran, remembering Allah, making supplication (du’a), giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding the ties of kinship, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and other good deeds and acts of worship.
      5.Sacrifice. One of the good deeds that will bring a person closer to Allah during these ten days is offering a sacrifice, by choosing a high-quality animal and fattening it, and spending money for the sake of Allah. (more information to follow, in sha Allah).
     6.Sincere repentance . One of the most important things to do during these ten days is to repent sincerely to Allah and to give up all kinds of disobedience and sin. Repentance means coming back to Allah and foregoing all the deeds, open and secret, that He dislikes, out of regret for what has passed, giving it up immediately and being determined never to return to it, but to adhere firmly to the Truth by doing what Allah loves.
If a Muslim commits a sin, he must hasten to repent at once, without delay, firstly because he does not know when he will die, and secondly because one evil deed leads to another.
Repentance at special times is very important because in most cases people’s thoughts turn towards worship at these times, and they are keen to do good, which leads to them recognizing their sins and feeling regret for the past. Repentance is obligatory at all times, but when the Muslim combines sincere repentance with good deeds during the days of most virtue, this is a sign of success, in sha Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""But as for him who repented, believed and did righteous deeds, then he will be among those who are successful."" [al-Qasas 28:67]
The Muslim should make sure that he does not miss any of these important occasions, because time is passing quickly. Let him prepare himself by doing good deeds which will bring him reward when he is most in need of it, for no matter how much reward he earns, he will find it is less than he needs; the time of departure is at hand, the journey is frightening, delusions are widespread, and the road is long, but Allah is ever watchful, and to Him will we return and render account. As the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning):
""So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it,
And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it."" [al-Zalzalah 99:7-8]
There is much to be gained, so make the most of the opportunity afforded by these invaluable and irreplaceable ten days. Hasten to do good works, before death strikes, before one can regret one’s negligence and failure to act, before one is asked to return to a place where no prayers will be answered, before death intervenes between the hopeful one and the things he hopes for, before you are trapped with your deeds in the grave.
O you whose hard heart is as dark as the night, is it not time that your heart was filled with light and became soft? Expose yourself to the gentle breeze of your Lord’s mercy during these ten days, for Allah will cause this breeze to touch whomever He wills, and whoever is touched by it will be happy on the Day of Judgement. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his Family and Companions.
And Allah knows best."

                If one wants to call somebody to Islam, how should he start?",,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Calling to Allah must be accompanied by wisdom, peaceful 
          advice and flexibility. Callers to Allah are to focus on the most important 
          issues and move to what follows. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said 
          to Mu’ath ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen, “First, call them to 
          testify that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger. 
          If they respond, ask them to perform five daily prayers. If they respond, 
          tell them that Allah has imposed Zakat (Alms taxes) which is to be taken 
          from the rich and distributed among the poor.
 
          One should also wait for the best opportunity by choosing 
          the suitable time and place for propagation."
513,1704,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1704,Does a Wife Have to Cook and Clean?,"Question

Is it the wife's duty to do all the housework, must the husband help her or not? Or is it possible that her work is just a favour to the husband and the family and she will be rewarded for it, as if she gave sadaqah?",It is the wife’s duty to serve her husband within the bounds of what is reasonable and as other wives who are like her serve husbands who are like him.,"Praise be to Allah.Should the wife serve her husband?
The more correct view in this matter is that stated by a number of scholars, such as Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ishaq al-Jawzjani and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on them), who said that it is the woman’s duty to serve her husband within the bounds of what is reasonable and as other women who are like her serve husbands who are like him. 
She also has to take care of the house, doing things like cooking and so on, in accordance with what is customary among people like her and her husband. This differs according to circumstances, time and place, hence Ibn Taymiyah said: This varies according to circumstances. What the Bedouin wife has to do is not the same as what the urban wife has to do.
Evidence for the view that it is a woman’s duty to serve her husband
The evidence for this more correct opinion is:

the Hadith of al-Bukhari:

Imam al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih that Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him for a servant. He said, Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah) thirty three times, Al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty three times, and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty four times. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, part 9/506)
Al-Tabari said, in his commentary on this Hadith: “We may understand from this Hadith that every woman who is able to take care of her house by making bread, grinding flour and so on, should do so. It is not the duty of the husband if it is the custom for women like her to do this themselves.”
What we learn from the Hadith is that when Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for a servant, he did not command her husband to find her a servant or hire someone to do these tasks, or to do these tasks himself. If it were Ali’s duty to do these things, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have commanded him to do them.

The Hadith of Asma bint Abi Bakr

Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I got married to al-Zubayr, and he had no wealth on earth and no slaves, nothing except a camel for bringing water and his horse. I used to feed his horse and bring water, and I used to sew patches on the bucket. I made dough but I was not good at baking bread, so my (female) neighbours among the Ansar used to bake bread for me, and they were sincere women. I used to bring date pits from al-Zubayr’s land that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had given to him, carrying them on my head. This land was two-thirds of a farsakh away. One day I came, carrying the date pits on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who had a group of the Ansar with him. He called me and made his camel kneel down for me to ride behind him, but I felt too shy to go with the men, and I remembered al-Zubayr and his jealousy, for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) realized that I felt shy, so he moved on. I came to al-Zubayr and told him, I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was carrying date pits on my head, and he had a group of his Companions with him. He made his camel kneel down for me to ride with him, but I remembered your jealousy. He said, By Allah, it bothers me more that you have to carry the date pits than that you should ride with him. Asma said: After that, Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse, and it was as if I had been liberated from slavery. (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 9/319).
In the commentary on the Hadith of Asma, it says: “From this incident we may understand that it is the woman's duty to take care of everything that her husband needs her to take care of. This was the opinion of Abu Thawr. Other fuqaha suggested that Asma did this voluntarily and that she was not obliged to do it.”
Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said: 
“It seems that this incident Asma carrying the date pits to help her husband and other similar incidents were the matter of necessity, namely that her husband al-Zubayr and other Muslim men were preoccupied with jihad and other things that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded them to do, and they did not have time to take care of domestic matters themselves, and could not afford to hire servants to do that for them, and there was no one else who could do that apart from their womenfolk. So the women used to take care of the home and whoever lived in it, so that the men could devote their time to supporting Islam.
Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him): What is more likely is that the matter had to do with the customs in that land, for customs may vary in this regard.
It seems that what Ibn Hajar said is close to the view of those who say that the wife has to take care of her husband and the home in accordance with the dictates of local custom.
Ibn al-Qayyim said, concerning the story of Asma: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Asma with the date pits on her head, and her husband al-Zubayr was with her, he did not tell him that she did not have to serve him, or that this was unfair to her. He approved of her serving him and of all the women among the Sahabah helping their husbands. This is a matter concerning which there is no doubt.

The Hadith of Jabir

The Shaykh of the Muhaddithin, Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: My father died and left seven daughters, or nine daughters. I married a woman who had been previously married, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, Did you get married, O Jabir? I said, Yes. He asked, A virgin or a previously-married woman? I said, A previously-married woman. He said, Why not a young woman so you could play and joke with one another? I said, ‘Abd-Allah [the father of Jabir] has died and left behind daughters, and I would not like to bring them someone who is like them, so I got married to a woman who can take care of them. He said, May Allah bless you or Fair enough. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513).
The evidence derived from the Hadith of Jabir is that al-Bukhari introduced this Hadith under the heading, Bab ‘awn al-marah zawjaha fi waladih (Chapter: a woman helping her husband with his children).
Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said, commenting on this introduction by al-Bukhari: It seems that al-Bukhari derived the idea that a woman should take care of her husband’s children from the fact that the wife of Jabir took care of his sisters; if she should take care of his sisters then it is even more befitting that she should take of his children. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513).
We can say that the wife should take care of her husband, as this is more befitting than her taking care of his sisters or his daughters from another wife.
We may also understand from this Hadith that what was customary at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that women did not only take care of their husbands, they also took care of those who were dependent on their husbands and lived in their houses.
The evidence that this understanding is correct is the fact that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell Jabir off for his reason for marrying a previously-married woman, which was that she could take care of his sisters. This indicates that the custom among the Muslims at that time dictated that the wife should take care of those who were under her husband’s care, which means that the wife should serve her husband in those matters that are dictated by local custom, because the husband’s right to be served by his wife comes before that of his sisters.

‘Urf (custom)

General contracts including marriage contracts should be governed by the customs that are known among the people, and the custom is that the wife should serve her husband and also take care of matters in the home. In some societies, the custom is that the wife should take care of more than the regular domestic matters.
Imam al-Qurtubi said, concerning the matter of the wife serving her husband and taking care of the home: This has to do with ‘Urf, which is one of the bases of Shari`ah. The women of the Bedouin and the desert-dwellers serve their husbands, even looking for fresh water and taking care of the animals
What happens nowadays is that the wife usually serves her husband and takes care of different matters within the home. There may be a servant to help her with that if her husband can afford it. If the husband knows that the majority of scholars say that it is not obligatory for the wife to serve her husband and take care of the house, I say that one of the benefits of this may be that he will not go to extremes and demand too much of his wife in this regard, and that he will not give her a hard time if she falls short, because what she is doing is not a duty according to the majority of jurists. However, even it is a duty according to some of them and this is what we think is more correct the fact that there is such a difference of opinion means that the husband has to look at what she is doing as something voluntary rather than obligatory, or something in which the scholars differ as to whether it is obligatory, so he should be gentle with her if he sees that she is falling short in this regard, and he should encourage her and help her to do it.

In some parts of the Scandinavian countries, the day may be much longer than the night, depending on the time of year. The night may be only three hours long, when the day is twenty-one hours. If it happens that Ramadan comes in the winter, the Muslims fast for only three hours, but if it happens that Ramadan comes in the summer, they do not fast because they are not able to, as the day is so long. Please tell us when we should have suhoor and iftaar, and on how many days of Ramadan we should fast.",,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is perfect and comprehensive. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]
“Say [O Muhammad]: ‘What thing is the most great to witness?’ Say: ‘Allah (the Most Great!) is Witness between me and you; this Quran has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach…” [al-An’aam 6:19]
“And We have not sent you [O Muhammad] except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind….” [Saba’ 34:28]
Allah has told the believers that fasting is obligatory (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Observing al-sawm (fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become the pious.” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
And Allah has explained when the fasting should begin and end (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and eat and drink until the white thread (light of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall…” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
This ruling is not addressed to any particular country or type of people; it is a universal law, which also includes the people asked about in the question. Allah is Merciful and Kind towards His slaves and has prescribed for them ways of ease to help them to do what He has made obligatory. For example, He allows travellers and the sick not to fast during Ramadan, to save them from hardship, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe fasting that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe sawm (fasts( must be made up] from other days…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
So every responsible adult Muslim who is present when Ramadan comes is obliged to fast, no matter whether the day is short or long. If a person is unable to complete a day’s fast, and fears that he may die or become ill, he is permitted to eat just enough to keep his strength up and keep himself safe from harm, then he should stop eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and he has to make up the days he has missed later on, when he is able to fast.

“O most noble of creation, I have nobody to 
    turn to except you when calamity strikes.” 
The major scholars have denounced this as

    narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, ‘Do not praise me as the Christians praised ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, I am the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’ 
    Rather the way to venerate him and love him is by following his Sunnah and establishing his religion and rejecting all the myths that the ignorant

    major shirk.”

    involved. But if the pictures are taken by someone using his own camera, in order to keep
    the pictures for himself, then this is not allowed. It is haraam not in and of itself, but
    because of the purpose, which is to keep the pictures for himself with no need to do so.
    The reason why you are taking the pictures, on the other hand, is for a legitimate and
    necessary purpose."

    the wife who gives birth and not to the other wife","Question

                A man has two wives, and it is the
      custom among us that when one of them gives birth, he should give her a gift after she
      finishes her nifaas (post-partum bleeding). Does he have to give a gift to both wives when
      one of the gives birth, or can he give a gift only to the one who has given birth?",,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that he does not have to give a
    gift to the wife who has not given birth; if she later gives birth, he does not have to
    give a gift to the other wife. Fairness means that he should give them gifts of equal
    value, i.e., if he gives the first wife one hundred when she gives birth, he should give
    his other wife one hundred when she gives birth. He does not have to give her anything
    before she gives birth, but if he is afraid that problems may arise, and he wants to give
    a gift to both wives each time one of them gives birth in order to avoid problems, then
    this is fine and is regarded as kind treatment in the interests of harmony. And Allaah

                What is your opinion on holding soccer
      tournaments where each team pays a sum of money as a subscription, and this money is spent
      on buying prizes which will be given to the winners and referees?",,"Praise be to Allah.What we think is that there are some reservations about
    giving prizes for games. These games are permissible so long as there is nothing haraam
    involved in them, such as uncovering ‘awraat, distracting people from their salaah,
    or players swearing at one another, all of which is haraam. If there is nothing haraam
    involved, then they are permissible and there is nothing wrong with them. But this taking
    contributions from all participants and giving it to the winner is not permissible,
    because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There should
    not be any prizes except for archery, camel-racing or horse-racing.” (Reported
    by Abu Dawood, no 2574; al-Tirmidhi, no. 1700; al-Nisaa’i, no 3586, 3587; Saheeh
    al-Jaami’, no. 7498). An exception is made for these three
    activities because they help in jihaad for the sake of Allaah.
    Taking prizes in any other kind of contest is haraam, but some scholars
    such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said that there is nothing wrong with betting in
    matters of shar’i knowledge, because shar’i knowledge is a kind of jihaad for
    the sake of Allaah. Jihaad for the sake of Allaah includes jihaad with weapons and jihaad
    with knowledge. But we think that what is mentioned in the question is not permissible.

523,1765,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1765,Raising the hands    in prayer,"Question

 
Give us explanation of rafayadain in the prayer.
Is It permissible or not.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands for takbeerat al-ihram (the takbeer at the beginning of the prayer), sometimes whilst saying the takbeer, sometimes after it and sometimes before. (al-Bukhari and al-Nisaa’i)
When he had finished reciting Quran, he would pause for a moment then raise his hands, say takbeer and do rukoo’.
(Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 128).
He used to raise his hands when he stood up from rukoo’
(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and this raising of the hands is mutawaatir (reported by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). It is the opinion of the majority of scholars and of some of the Hanafis. (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by al-Albaani, p. 136).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say takbeer when he got up for the third rak’ah
(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and he would raise his hands sometimes when he said this takbeer. (al-Bukhaari and Abu Dawood). (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 177).
Raising the hands in prayer was a well-known practice among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Imaam al-Bukhaari said: “Al-Hasan and Humayd ibn Hilaal said: ‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all used to raise their hands, without exception.”
(Juz’ raf’ al-yadayn, p. 26, ma’a jila’ al-‘aynayn).
Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Look at the practice at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Sahaabah after him. They used to raise their hands in prayer when doing rukoo’, and when standing up again. And in the time of the Sahaabah, if ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar saw someone not raising his hands in prayer, he would throw a stone at him. [next phrase is unclear].
(I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/376).
So what is proven in the Sunnah with regard to raising the hands in prayer is that they should be raised at four points in the prayer: when pronouncing takbeerat al-ihram, when doing rukoo’, when standing up from rukoo’, and after standing up from the first tashahhud.

524,1774,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1774,Is the First Look at Women Allowed?,"Question

I know it is absolutely forbidden to gaze at women. If one accidentally catches my eyes sometimes I keep looking for a second or two and then I remember Allah's command and immediately look down.
My question is: for that very little time that I do look at the lady, do I earn sins?","Deliberately looking at a non-Mahram woman and continuing to look after a first accidental glance is prohibited. It is forbidden to look at any part of her body, whether you think she is beautiful or not, whether it provokes sexual desire or not, whether it is accompanied by evil thoughts or not, and whether it leads to immoral deeds or not.","Praise be to Allah.Jarir ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) about an accidental glance at a woman . He commanded me to turn my gaze away."" (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, who said: This is an authentic Hadith. See As-Sunan, 2700).
Commenting on this Hadith, Al-Mubarakpuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
""Accidental means that his gaze fell on a non-Mahram woman unintentionally . He commanded me to turn my gaze away means that he was not to look a second time, because the first glance was not by choice and would be forgiven, but any further glances would be counted as sin, and he should heed the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) [An-Nur 24:30]""
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""O `Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second."" (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2701; see Sahih Al-Jami`, 7953)
In At-Tuhfah, it says: ""The words ‘do not follow a glance with another’ mean do not look again after the first glance. You will be forgiven for the first means that you will be forgiven if the first glance was unintentional, and but not for the second means that because the second glance was by choice, it will be counted against you.""
So it is clear that deliberately looking at a non-Mahram woman and continuing to look after a first accidental glance is prohibited. It is forbidden to look at any part of her body, whether you think she is beautiful or not, whether it provokes sexual desire or not, whether it is accompanied by evil thoughts or not, and whether it leads to immoral deeds or not.
We ask Allah to protect you and us from all forbidden deeds. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

names. It's been a year and all my records reflect this name not to mention 
that everyone is accustomed to it. Am I burdened to officially put an 
Abdul infront of my name or can I just start verbally using it? Also, I was 
told that it was haram to change my name.",,"Praise be to Allah.
Some of Allaahs names are also suitable for human beings and it is permissible to use 
them, so long as one distinguishes between the meaning applied to the Creator and the 
meaning applied to the created being, such as Kareem (generous), Lateef (kind), 
Shaheed (witness), Hakeem (wise), etc. Other Divine names may not be given to human 
beings because they are befitting only for Allaah, such as al-Baari (the Creator), 
al-Raaziq (the Provider), al-Muhyi (the Giver of Life), al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir 
(the Last), etc.
If your name is of the first type, then there is nothing wrong with it. If it is of the 
second type, then putting the word ""Abd"" (slave of) in front of the name will solve the 
problem. May Allaah help us to adhere to the truth.

What does Islam say about life partner? Is she/he fixed by Allah or Allah has left it for us to decide?","Man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry, and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allah.","Praise be to Allah.First of all, we should realize that there is no contradiction between our belief that Allah has decreed everything, and our belief that He has given us free will which enables us to do things. Confirming the free will of His slaves, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""To whomsoever among you wills to walk straight"" [At-Takwir 81:28]

Our will operates within the will of Allah , not outside of it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""But you cannot will, unless Allah wills…"" [Al-Insan 76:30] 
Thus it is not permitted to try to cancel one idea out with the other, or to deny either of them. Allah has confirmed both, that man has the power to choose, and that nothing can operate outside of His Will, may He be Glorified.

If we apply this to the question asked, we will see that man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry , and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allah. 
The man’s choice is the means by which he gets what he wants, but some obstacles may come between the person and what he wants, in which case he will realize that Allah has not decreed this for him, for some reason which is known to Him.
Everything that Allah does is good, and His slaves do not have knowledge of the Unseen or of how things will end. A person may regret missing out on something when it is good that he did not have it, or he may hate something that happens to him when it is good that it happened to him, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know."" [Al-Baqarah 2:216]

      well-mannered girl to be my wife, but when I told my father about this, he rejected the
      idea. I have tried to convince him but he is insisting. I wanted to know why, but he said
      there is no reason why. I am confused. Should I obey my father and forget about the girl I
      have chosen even though this will cause me and my family so much pain? I hope that you
      will advise of the right thing to do. May Allaah reward you with good.",,"Praise be to Allah.This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to
    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as
    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some
    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your
    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him
    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel
    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a
    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother
    what he likes for himself.”
It is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl
    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so
    that you will understand what is going on. 
Our advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and
    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and
    avoid division, then do so.
But you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is
    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may
    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage
    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose
    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy
    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If
    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father
    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to
    help you make the right choice."

                In some bookshops there are advertisements for a scheme whereby the customer pays a set amount of money each month and gets two things: he will be supplied with new books in a specific area of interest, such as fiqh, etc, and he will get a 10% discount if he wants to buy books from these stores. What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of gambling, concerning which Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic 
          drinks), gambling, al-ansaab (stone altars for making sacrifices to 
          idols, etc.) and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are 
          an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that 
          (abomination)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:90]
Gambling means everything that involves one side trying 
          to take advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the 
          other will be the loser. This is the shar’i ruling on gambling. So a 
          man who pays 500 riyals every month, for example, may buy books for 
          which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or he may 
          not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which 
          the discount adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will 
          be the winner, and the storekeeper will be the loser; if he does not 
          buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner and the man will 
          be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in

A man committed many sins. He is suffering from a severe illness and has tried treatment to no avail. The doctors have told him that they have no cure for his problem. Now he regrets his past and wants to repent. Does his repentance count now that he is suffering from this terminal illness from which he has no hope of a cure?",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, the repentance of a man who does not hope to live for long does count. This applies whether he has an incurable illness such as cancer; or he has been sentenced to death, such as a man who has been brought out for execution, even if the sword is being raised above his head; or a married man who has committed adultery and been sentenced to stoning, even if the stones have already been gathered. His repentance is valid, because Allah accepts the repentance of a man so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they to whom Allah will forgive, and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.”
[4:17]
The meaning of the phrase “and repent soon afterwards” means that they repent before they die.
In the following ayah (verse), Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent.’”
[ 4:18]
There are five essential conditions for repentance: sincerity, regret for what one has done, giving it up immediately, determination not to repeat it in the future, and repenting during the time when repentance will be accepted, i.e., before one dies or before the sun rises in the west."
530,1808,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1808,"Advice: Separating women from non-mahram* men in 
family visits","Question

                What advice can you give Muslim families in regards to family 
visits and gatherings?",,"Praise be to Allah.People are civil and sociable by nature: they must have friends, and 
friendship involves visiting one another.
When visits are between families, we must pay attention to an important 
matter which will close the door to evil, by not allowing mixing between the 
sexes. One of the indications that mixing is haraam is the aayah 
(interpretation of the meaning): "" And when you ask (the Prophet's 
wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is 
purer for your hearts and for their hearts"" [al-Ahzaab 33:53]
If we examine the evil results of mixing in family gatherings, we will find 
many examples of corruption and immorality, for example:In most cases, women's hijaab in mixed gatherings is either 
non-existant or not correct. These women display the beauty which 
Allaah has forbidden them to show to anyone before whom they is 
not allowed to uncover, as it says in the aayah (interpretation of the 
meaning): "" and not to reveal their adornment "" [al-Noor 24:31] 
It even happens that women who adorn themselves in mixed 
gatherings never adorn themselves for their husbands.

When men see women in mixed gatherings, this destroys their 
religious commitment and morals, and provokes forbidden desires.

Terrible arguments and marital separations may result, when one 
looks at or winks at the wife of another, or they laugh and joke 
together. When the couple returns home, the settling of accounts 
begins:Man: ""Why did you laugh at so-and-so's words, when he never said 
anything funny?Woman: ""And why did you wink at so-and-so?""Man: ""When he speaks you understand him readily, but when I speak 
you never understand me!""
So the exchange of accusations goes on, until it ends in hatred or 
even divorce, in some cases.

Some men and women may begin to regret their luck in marriage, 
when they begin to compare their spouses with those of their friends. 
A man may say to himself, ""So-and-so joins in discussions and is 
well-educated, but my wife is ignorant and is not educated at all"" 
And a woman may say to herself, ""So-and-so is so lucky, her 
husband is so eloquent and smart, and my husband is so boring and 
speaks without thinking"" This destroys the marriage relationship 
and leads to bad treatment on the part of both spouses.

Some may show off to others by making false claims about what they 
do not have, so that one man may issue instructions to his wife in 
front of other men so that he can pretend to have a strong personality, 
when at home he is like a tame pussy-cat. A woman may borrow gold 
so that others in the gathering may think she owns so much, but the 
Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
""The one who claims to have what he does not own is as it were 
wearing a garment of falsehood."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 9/317)

These mixed night-time gatherings are often a waste of time, filled 
with idle gossip and other sins of the tongue, whilst small children are 
left at home (so that the gathering will not be spoiled by their crying!)

These night-time gatherings may become even worse and involve 
other major sins, such as drinking and gambling, especially among the 
so-called upper class. Another of the major sins that may result is the 
desire to follow the kuffaar and be like them in dress and other habits 
and customs. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings 
of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever imitates a people is one of 
them."" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 2/50; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 
2828)

In family gatherings, women should be separated from non-mahram men, 
and the gatherings should serve some useful purpose, such as 
remembrance of Allaah (dhikr), seeking beneficial knowledge or discussing 
social problems or things that can benefit the family in this life. We ask 
Allaah to keep us safe and healthy. May Allaah bless our Prophet 
Muhammad.

is permanently forbidden, such as a woman's father, brother, son, uncle,

                What is the ruling on a person who

                What, in your view, is the shar’i
      ruling on selling on consignment and selling goods bought from abroad before they arrive
      in one’s store?",,"Praise be to Allah.The first question is: what is the ruling on selling on
    consignment? This means that a person says, I will sell you these goods – whatever
    you manage to sell will come under this deal, and whatever you do not sell, I will take
    back. This transaction in haraam, because it clearly involves an unknown element as
    neither the vendor nor the purchaser knows how much of the goods will be sold. The issue
    here is jahaalah (ignorance, not knowing). It was reported that the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade sales that involve undue risk (gharar)
    and this is clearly a risky transaction.
But if the two sides have to do a deal, then the owner of the goods
    should give them to the other party to sell them on his behalf, and give him a reward for
    acting as his agent. This will achieve the aim of both parties, with the latter acting as
    an agent for the former. There is nothing wrong with this.
As for selling goods before they arrive, this is not permitted either,
    because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade selling from the
    same place where goods are bought before the trader has actually acquired them (lit. added
    them to his own luggage). He should first take possession of them, then he can sell them.
    As for selling them when they are in another country, when he does not know if they will
    arrive intact or not, this is not permitted.
If a person were to say that the purchaser is obliged to accept the
    goods “as is”, whether they are defective or not, our response is: a person may
    agree to that, hoping to make a profit, but if the goods turn out to be defective, he will
    regret it and be upset, and a dispute may arise between him and the vendor. Islam –
    praise be to Allaah – has blocked the way to regret, disputes and conflict.
By the same token, if the goods get destroyed en route, conflicts may
    arise between the two parties. The point here is that it is not permitted to sell goods
    until they have have reached the vendor, then he may sell them."

Yes, this is permitted for removing armpit hair and pubic hair, because the

                It is no secret that the forbidden habit of smoking is widespread, in the workplace, in the home and in public areas. The question is, is it permissible to sit with smokers? If a person is sitting with a smoker in his home or in a public gathering, should he leave him and go out?",,"Praise be to Allah.As the brother has mentioned, smoking is haraam because of the general evidence that indicates that it is haraam. There is no specific text from the Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because smoking only emerged recently, but the principles of sharee’ah are general in application, and some indications in some reports indicate that it is haraam. If a smoker sits next to you and wants to smoke, then advise him gently and kindly. Tell him, “My brother, this is haraam, and it is not permissible for you.”
I think that if you advise him kindly and gently, he will refrain from smoking, as we and others have found out by experience. If he does not refrain from smoking, then you have to leave him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them…” [al-Nisa’ 4:140]

    they are limiting themselves to that? We say, yes they can, if they make a great effort,
    just as a person can become a scholar if he takes knowledge from books. But the difference
    between taking knowledge from books and tapes and receiving it directly from the scholars
    is that it is much better to take it directly from the scholars, because then it is easy
    to discuss things, unlike when listening to tapes or reading books. It requires a great
    deal of effort to learn all aspects of knowledge in this way. (By the same token, learning
    directly from scholars means that one is less likely to misunderstand things than when one
    learns from tapes and books)."

                Is it permissible to eat dishes cooked with alcohol? It is well-known that alcohol evaporates with heat.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to eat dishes cooked with 
  alcohol, as ALL the alcohol is not evaporated with cooking or heat. Refer to 
  the following, quoted from the famous Mayo Clinic:
[Begin quote]
Many people believe that 
  because alcohol is sensitive to heat, it is eliminated with cooking. However, 
  not all the alcohol content of alcoholic drinks is removed with heat; it depends 
  on the type and time of cooking. For instance if you add beer or wine to boiling 
  liquid, then immediately remove it from the heat, 85 per cent of the alcohol 
  content will remain. If you light the alcohol, as in flambé dishes, 75 
  per cent will remain. Even after simmering the dish for one and a half hours, 
  it will still have 20 per cent of the original alcohol content.
It is only if you simmer 
  the mixture for two or more hours, (as you would with a wine-based beef casserole), 
  that as little as five to 10 per cent of the original alcohol content remains."
537,1815,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1815,"Why will the
    people who ask others for Ruqyah be of a lesser status?","Question

                We want to understand the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) in which the Prophet 
 (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) says of the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being called to account that they “do not ask for ruqyah (seek healing
      through spiritual means e.g. by recitation of Qur’aan etc.)…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6472 and 6541; Muslim, no. 220).
Does this hadeeth include all kinds of treatment? If this is not
the case, what is the difference between (medical) treatment and ruqyah, because both of them may effect a cure? How are we to understand the Prophet’s command to ‘Aa’ishah and others to seek healing from al-‘ayn (the evil eye) through ruqyah? If we know that a person has been afflicted by the evil eye, should we tell him to seek healing through ruqyah or should we tell him to bear it with patience and hope for reward from Allaah?",,"Praise be to Allah.The phrase in the hadeeth about the seventy thousand who
    will enter Paradise without being called to account, that they “do not ask for
    ruqyah” means that they do not seek it from others. But the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us and taught us to seek treatment, as he said:
    “Allaah has not created any disease without also creating the cure; some know it and
    some do not.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5678).
    Ruqyah and seeking medical treatment differ in two ways:
The first difference is that a person will feel a greater attachment to
    the one who does ruqyah than to the one who offers medical treatment, because if Allaah
    decrees that he should be healed through ruqyah, the bond between the person who did the
    ruqyah and the person who was sick is a spiritual bond, as the cure did not come about
    through physical means. The fact that it is a spiritual bond may be a source of fitnah
    (temptation or trial), as he may say, “he is one of the awliya’ (close friends)
    of Allaah” and so on, which may lead him to shirk (associating partners with Allaah).
    Hence it was followed by the words “… and who put their trust in their
    Lord.”
The second difference is that a sick person may ask for ruqyah from
    someone who is not qualified to do it, because the latter is not using something tangible
    that can be identified. So the person who has been asked to do ruqyah may do it, and the
    sick person may be healed coincidentally, not as a result of the ruqyah which was not done
    according to sharee’ah, but at the same time as the ruqyah is done, so people may
    suffer fitnah because of this, and think that this is a person whose du’aa’s are
    answered and whose ruqyah is blessed, when this is not the case.
For this reason the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said, “… those who do not ask for ruqyah..” and did not say
    “those who do not seek treatment. Seeking treatment is essential, but it is better
    not to seek ruqyah. However, if a person comes forward and recites something over you and
    you do not stop him, this does not mean that you are not counted among the people
    mentioned in the hadeeth, because you did not ask for ruqyah. By the same token, if you do
    ruqyah for your brother, you are doing him a favour, and this does not rule you out from
    being one of the seventy thousand. Thus we say that the extra phrase reported in Saheeh
    Muslim, “… and they did not do ruqyah…” is a dubious addition
    that is not saheeh. The correct wording is only “Those who did not ask for
    ruqyah.”
With regard to seeking ruqyah from a scholar, if he is known as such
    then you can ask him for ruqyah, because if he treats a person with ruqyah, they will
    benefit from it, by the grace of Allaah, as is the case with doctors who treat people.
With regard to the question of whether we should treat the person who
    is afflicted by the evil eye with ruqyah or tell him to bear it with patience, the
    Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us the way to seek healing
    from the evil eye, when he told the one who had put the evil eye on one of his companions
    to do ghusl and wudoo’, then to take some of the water and pour it over the one who
    was afflicted until he recovered."
538,1816,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1816,Renovating orphan’s property with zakaah money,"Question

                There are some orphans whose guardian I am, as their father died many years ago. They have a monthly income from their father’s retirement fund of 3500 riyaals. Over the years I have accumulated a large sum of money, of which approximately 150,000 comes from zakaah. Should I stop accepting zakaah on their behalf? What should I do with the zakaah money I have? They have a house that needs to be repaired, and there is still 240,000 owing to the real-estate company.

Can I pay off the deceased’s debts from this (zakaah) money? They have land from the city so can we pay for building a fence around it from this money?",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it is not permissible for you to take zakaah on
    their behalf, because they have enough money of their own. Zakaah is for the poor and
    needy, not for orphans. Whatever you have taken at the time when they had enough of their
    own has to be given back to the original donors, if you know who they are, otherwise you
    must give it away in charity with the intention of it being zakaah on their behalf,
    because you took it with the intention of it being zakaah from them.
As for the money that you have accumulated from the retirement fund,
    use it as you see fit, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And
    come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it…”
    [al-An’aam 6:152].
As for the debt to the real estate development company, you know that
    it is to be repaid in installments, not all at once, so pay it back in installments. The deceased has nothing to do with it, except with regard to the installments that were due before his death, if he did not pay them. As for the installments that were not due until after his death, they are nothing to do with him because they have to do with this  property, the ownership of which has passed to his heirs. So they are responsible for these repayments, and they should not be paid from the zakaah money, because they have enough money of their own with which to pay them."

When should zakaah be paid on money that is loaned out?",,"Praise be to Allah.This matter may be summed up as follows:

1.   The lender has to pay zakaah annually on the money lent, if the borrower is rich and is known to repay debts promptly. In this case, because it is possible to recover the money readily, it is like money that is in one's possession.
2.   The lender has to pay zakaah one full year after recovering the money if the borrower is in difficulty or is known to delay repayment. He does not have to pay zakaah before he gets the money back, because it is not readily accessible and this is not like money that is in one's possession."
540,1819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1819,Jinn Entering Human Bodies,"Question

In the last few days a controversy has arisen concerning the matter of jinn entering human bodies. Some say that this is rationally impossible, because of the difference in the essences from which they were created, as man was created from clay and the jinn from fire. It has also been said that the shayateen (devils) have no power other than waswas (insinuating whispers) and that Allah has not given them any power over man. And it is said that the recorded tapes that are in circulation (recordings of jinn supposedly speaking through people) are no proof of anything. What is your response to all this?",,"Praise be to Allah.The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah (main body of Muslims who are united upon the sunnah), and by real-life events. No one disputes this apart from the M’utazilah (a deviant sect) who give priority to their own rational analysis over the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah. We will mention a little about this below:
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who eat riba (interest) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Riba’…” [2:275]
Al-Qurtubi said in his Tafseer (exegesis): “This ayah (verse) is proof that those people are wrong who deny that epilepsy is caused by the jinn and claim that its causes are only physical, and that the Shaytan does not enter people or cause madness.”
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer, after mentioning the ayah quoted above: “They will not rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection except like the way in which the epileptic rises during his seizure, when he is beaten by the Shaytan. This is because they will rise in a very bad state. Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the one who consumes riba will rise on the Day of Resurrection crazy and choking.”
According to a saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) narrated by al-Nasai from Abu’l-Yusr, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray: “Allahumma innee a’oodhu bika min al-taraddi wa’l-haram wa’l-gharaq wa’l-harq, wa a’oodhu bika an yatakhabatani al-shaytan ‘ind al-mawt (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from being thrown from a high place, old age, drowning and burning; and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death).” Commenting on this hadeeth in Al-Fayd, al-Manawi said: “[The phrase] ‘and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death’ means, lest he should wrestle with me and play with me, and damage my religious commitment or mental state (at the time of death) by means of his insinuating whispers which cause people to slip or lose their minds. The Shaytan could take control of a person when he is about to depart this world, and misguide him or stop him from repenting…”
Ibn Taymiyah said: “The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘Those who eat riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like riba’…’ [2:275].
And in as-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Shaytan flows through the son of Adam as the blood flows through his veins.’”
‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: “I said to my father, ‘There are some people who say that the jinn do not enter the body of the epileptic.’ He said: ‘O my son, they are lying; the jinn could speak through this person.’” Commenting on this, Ibn Qudamah said: “What he said is well known, because a person may suffer an epileptic seizure and speak in a language that no one understands, and his body may be beaten with blows that would fell a camel, but the epileptic does not feel them at all, and he is also unaware of the words he is saying. The epileptic and others may be dragged about, or the carpet on which he is sitting may be pulled, and utensils may be moved about from place to place, and other things may happen. Anyone who witnesses such a thing will know for sure that the one who is speaking through the person and moving these things is not human.” And he said, may Allah have mercy on him: “There is no one among the imams (religious leaders/scholars) of the Muslims who denies that jinn may enter the body of the epileptic and others. Anyone who denies this and claims that Islam denies it is lying about Islam. There is nothing in the proofs of sharee’ah (Islamic law) to show that it does not happen.”
So the fact that jinn may enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, some of whose comments we have quoted above.
As regards the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s Leave” [2:102], this is undoubtedly a clear indication that the jinn cannot harm anyone through witchcraft or epilepsy or through any other kind of disturbance or misguidance, except with the permission of Allah. As al-Hasan al-Basri said: “Whomever Allah wills, He gives them power over him, and whomever He does not will, He does not give them power over him, and they cannot do anything to anyone except with the permission of Allah.” The Shaytan (who is the disbelieving jinn) may gain power over the believers by making them sin and by making them neglect the remembrance and Tawheed of Allah (maintaining Allah’s Oneness) and sincerity in worshipping Him. But he has no power over the righteous slaves of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) — you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.” [17:65]
During the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) the Arabs were well aware of this and mentioned it in their poetry. For example, the poet al-A’asha likened his she-camel’s energy to that of one who was touched by the jinn, and said that it was the jinn who was giving her energy.
As regards the causes of epilepsy, Ibn Taymiyah explained the causes. He said: “When the jinn touch a person with epilepsy, it may be because of desire or love, just as happens between one human and another… or it may – as is usually the case – be because of hatred and punishment, such as when a person has harmed them or they think that he has harmed them deliberately, either by urinating on them or pouring hot water on them or killing them, even if the person did that unknowingly. There are ignorant and wrongdoing ones among the jinn who may punish a person more than he deserves, or they may be playing with him and mistreating him, like foolish people among mankind.”
And I say: the way to save oneself from this is to remember Allah and speak His Name at the beginning of all things, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to mention Allah in many cases, such as when eating, drinking, mounting his riding-beast, taking off his clothes for any reason, having intercourse and so on…
As regards treatment (of one whose body has been entered by the jinn), Ibn Taymiyah said (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 19/42): “When the jinn attack a person, they should be told of the rulings of Allah and His Messenger, proof should be established against them, and they should be commanded to do what is good and told not to do what is evil, just as should be done in the case of people, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)’ [al-Israa’ 17:15].” Then he said: “If the jinn does not leave after being addressed in this manner, then it is permissible to rebuke him, tell him off, threaten him and curse him, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with the Shaytaan when he came with a falling star to throw it in his face, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I seek refuge with Allah from you and I curse you with the curse of Allah” – three times. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).
We may also seek help against the jinn by remembering Allah (dhikr) and reciting Qur’an, especially Aayat al-Kursiy. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites it will remain under the protection of Allah and no Shaytaan (devil) will be able to approach him until the morning.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). And al-Mi’wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’an) may also be recited.
As for psychiatrists who do not treat the epileptic in the manner described, they cannot do him any good at all.
This issue may be discussed in much more detail, but what we have said here is sufficient for those who want to know a little about this matter, Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds."
541,1822,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1822,Letters of credit,"Question

                One of the practices which is well-known
      in the financial field nowadays is when a businessman wants to import a product, for
      example, he asks the bank for a letter of credit for a certain amount, either in his own
      account or from the bank itself, and the bank takes some form of payment for providing
      this letter of credit. What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.Lord of the Worlds.
    Firstly: Letters of credit may be of different types, initial or final.
    Either type of letter of credit may or may not be covered by the balance in the
    businessman’s account. If it is not covered, then the the issuer bears joint
    liability with the applicant with regard to current and future obligations. This is
    essentially what is known in Islamic fiqh as damaan (liability) or kafaalah
    (sponsorship or surety).
If the letter of credit is covered, then the relationship between the
    one who is requesting it and the provider (the bank) is that of an agency. Acting as an
    agent is valid whether or not a fee is paid, so long as the agent relationship serves the
    interest of the one for whom it is done (in this case the third party from whom the good
    are being purchased). 
Kafaalah (sponsorship) is a voluntary agreement whose purpose is
    goodwill. The fuqaha’ have stated that it is not permissible to accept a fee in
    return for it, because in that case when the sponsor (kafeel) receives a sum of money when
    the credit is paid, it becomes like a loan which brought some benefit to the lender, which
    is not allowed in Islam [because it is like riba or interest – Translator].
On this basis, the following is clear:
Firstly: that it is not permissible to charge a fee for issuing a
    letter of credit – which usually takes into account the amount of money and length of
    time involved – whether the credit is covered or not.
Secondly: charging administration fees for preparing either type of
    letter of credit is permissible, so long as the amount charged does not exceed what is
    usual, whether the letter of credit is wholly or partly covered. In evaluating the
    administration fee for issuing a letter of credit, it should be taken into account what is
    actually involved in doing so. And Allaah knows best."

                Many doctors hesitate to decide the
      right time to turn off the life support systems of a person who is clinically dead. The
      doctor has two conflicting feelings: he may think that he is prolonging the agony of the
      dying person, and that if he turns of fthe life support system, he will be giving the
      person the relief of dying. On the other hand, however, he fears that by turning the life
      support systems off, he is depriving the person of the opportunity to continue living.
      When is it permissible to turn off the life support systems in the case of people who are
      clinically dead?",,"Praise be to Allah.In sharee’ah, a person is considered to be dead and therefore
    subject to all the rulings concerning the deceased, when either of the two following signs
    are noted:
When his heartbeat and breathing stop completely, and the doctors decide
        that they cannot be restarted.

When all the functions of his brain stop completely, and experienced
        doctors and specialists state that this is irreversible, and his brain has started to
        disintegrate.

In these circumstances, it is permissible to turn off life support

        and the first tenant, before the first tenancy expires or afterwards.

Secondly, if the landlord and tenant agree that the tenant will pay a
    certain amount of money in addition to the regular rent – which in some countries is
    called a deposit – there is nothing Islamically wrong with paying this amount,
    provided that it is counted as part of the rent for the agreed period; when the contract
    comes to an end, this amount is subject to the rulings on rents.
When the rental period comes to an end, and is not renewed explicitly
    or implicitly – in cases where automatic renewal is provided for in a clause of the
    lease – it is not permitted to pay this money, because the landlord has more right to
    the property once the tenant no longer has any right to it.
Fourthly, if an agreement is reached between the first tenant and the
    new tenant during the period of the tenancy agreement that the former will give up the
    remainder of his lease in return for a sum of money over and above the regular rent, this
    transaction is permissible, provided that attention is paid to the terms of the contract
    drawn up between the landlord and the first tenant, because many rental agreements
    expressly state that tenants are not allowed to sublet properties to other parties or to
    accept “key-money” except with the agreement of the landlord. If this is the
    case, it must be adhered to.
If the agreement between the first tenant and the new tenant is reached
    after the expiry of the lease, it is haraam to pay key-money, because the first tenant no
    longer has any rights with regard to the property. And Allaah knows best."

What is the ruling on paying in installments, and what is the Shari`ah solution in dealing with late payments on the part of some purchasers?","It is permissible to charge more for purchases by installment than when a person is paying in full at the time of purchase. It is also permissible to name one price for cash sales, and another for payment by installments made within certain periods.","Praise be to Allah.·         It is permissible to charge more for purchases by installment than when a person is paying in full at the time of purchase. It is also permissible to name one price for cash sales , and another for payment by installments made within certain periods. The sale is not valid unless both parties are certain about either cash or installments. If there is some indecision with regard to cash or installments, and the two parties fail to reach an agreement on one specific price, then the sale is not permissible according to Shari`ah.
·         According to Shari`ah, it is not permissible in the case of payment by installments, to state interest rates as a separate item based on the length of time taken to repay, regardless of whether the two parties agree on the rate of interest or it is based on the current rate.
·         If the purchaser is late in paying the installments, it is not permissible to make him pay extra , whether or not this is arranged as a prior condition, because this is a form of forbidden Riba.
·         It is forbidden for a debtor who can afford the installments to delay payment when they are due. At the same time, according to Shari`ah it is not permissible to set a condition that he should pay compensation in the event of late payments.
·         According to Shari`ah, it is permissible to set a condition that the debtor has to bring forward the payment, if he delays some of the payments , so long as the debtor agrees to this condition at the time when the contract is drawn up.
·         The vendor does not have the right to keep the purchaser’s property after the item has been sold, but it is permissible for the vendor to stipulate some security as a guarantee that the purchaser will pay the installments. (Majma Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, p. 109)
·         It is permissible according to Shari`ah to reduce the amount owing in order to expedite the settlement of the matter, whether this is done by request of the vendor or the purchaser. This is not counted as forbidden Riba so long as it is not based on a prior agreement and so long as this agreement between the two parties is reached on a one-on-one basis, without the involvement of any third party, because in that case the rulings on the settlement of business accounts would apply.
·         It is permissible for the two parties to agree that all installments should be paid immediately if the debtor fails to make one payment, unless he is in difficulty and has no means of paying.
·         If the debt becomes due because the debtor dies, becomes bankrupt or delays payment, then in any of these circumstances it is permissible to reduce the debt so that the matter may be settled quickly to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.
·         The definition of hardship which means that the vendor should wait for payment is: that the debtor should not have more wealth or property than he needs to meet his basic requirements and pay his debt.

                What is the ruling on purchase and
      rental transactions etc. made via modern inventions such as the telephone, fax, telex and
      the Internet etc. If the transaction usually takes place in an office or store, what is
      the ruling on cases where these modern means are used?",,"Praise be to Allah.According to shareeah, a transaction is made when there is an
    offer [of goods or services] and this is accepted, within the framework of shar'i
    conditions and in the absence of anything that might invalidate the transaction. An
    example of this in the case of a sale might be when the vendor says I sell this to
    you and the purchaser says I agree. There have been major developments
    in the field of communications which are now widely used to speed up financial dealings
    and transactions, which we must bear in mind whilst also taking into account what the
    fuqahaa have said about carrying out transactions via letter, in writing, by means
    of gestures or through intermediaries. They also established that transactions should be
    carried out between two parties who are present in the same place  with the
    exception of wills, the appointment of executors and the giving of power of attorney; the
    offer and agreement should both refer to the same thing and price, there should be no
    expression or indication that either party is turning away from the deal, and the
    agreement to an offer should not be delayed beyond whatever timespan is customarily
    regarded as acceptable.
In the light of the above, the fuqahaa have established the
    following:
If the transaction is carried out between two parties who are not
        present in the same place where one can actually see the other or hear his voice, and the
        only means of communication between them is by writing, mail, sending a messenger, this
        applies also to telegraphs, telexes, faxes and computer screens, in these cases the
        transaction is complete when the offer reaches the prospective purchaser and he agrees to
        it.

If the transaction is drawn up at the same time, between two parties who
        are in different locations  which applies to telephones and wireless communications
         the contract between them is considered to be a contract drawn up between two
        parties who are present in the same place, and in this case the basic rulings as stated by
        the fuqahaa and referred to in al-Deebaajah apply.

If the vendor makes a limited-time offer through these means of
        communication, he is bound by it for the duration and he cannot go back on it.

The rules outlined above do not include nikaah (marriage contracts)
        because of the requirement of two witnesses in nikaah, or barter because there has to be
        an actual exchange of goods or services, or forward buying, because this requires a cash
        down-payment.

In cases where there is the possibility of forgery, fraud or error,
        reference should be made to the general rules concerning the establishment of proof.l

The menstruating woman herself is not naajis, neither is her sweat. The Jews used to think this, but Allah stated that this was a lie, as is reported in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) from Anas:
 
""When one of their women menstruated, the Jews would not eat with her or sit with her in their houses. The Companions of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) asked the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) about this, and Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): ‘They ask you about menstruation.

The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ‘Do everything except have intercourse.’ Word of this reached the Jews and they said: ‘What does this man mean, in every issue he differs from us!’"" (Saheeh Muslim, 455).

If a woman dislikes her husband’s treatment of her – for
        example, he is over-strict, hot-tempered or easily-provoked, or gets angry a lot, or
        criticizes her and rebukes her for the slightest mistake or shortcoming, then she has the
        right of khula’ [female-instigated divorce].

If she dislikes his physical appearance because of some deformity or
        ugliness, or because one of his faculties is missing, she has the right of khula’.

If he is lacking in religious commitment – for example, he
        doesn’t pray, or neglects to pray in jamaa’ah, or does not fast in Ramadaan
        without a proper excuse, or he goes to parties where haraam things are done, such as
        fornication, drinking alcohol and listening to singing and musical instruments, etc.
        – she has the right of khula’.

If he deprives of her of her rights of spending on her maintenance,
        clothing and other essential needs, when he is able to provide these things, then she has
        the right to ask for khula’.

If he does not give her her conjugal rights and thus keep her chaste
        because he is impotent (i.e. unable to have intercourse), or because he does not like her,
        or he prefers someone else, or he is unfair in the division of his time [i.e., among
        co-wives], then she has the right to ask for khula’.

One of the words being repeated is al-mala al-a'ala. I do not know what this means. I know that al-a'ala means the most high. Could you please help me with this? I appreciate your time and your help.",,"Praise be to Allah.
    The phrase al-mala al-a’ala is mentioned in both the Quran and the sunnah 
    (prophetic teachings).
    In Surah Saad, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    ""‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing 
    and discussing (about the creation of Adam). Only this has been inspired to 
    me, that I am a plain warner.’"" [38:69-70]
    In his commentary on this ayah (verse), Shaykh al-Mufassireen Ibn Jareer al-Tabari 
    (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on 
    high (al-mala al-a’ala) when they were disputing and discussing’: here Allah 
    is telling His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , 
    ‘O Muhammad, say to the mushrikeen (polytheists) among your people: ""I had 
    no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and 
    discussing"" about the creation of Adam before Allah revealed this to me.’ 
    What this means is: ‘My telling you about this is clear proof that this 
    Quran is a Revelation from Allah, because you know that I had no knowledge 
    of this before this Quran was revealed; it is not something I witnessed with 
    my own two eyes – I know it only because Allah has informed me of it.’"" 
    Other scholars of tafseer (exegesis) have said something similar to this.
    The comments of other scholars:
    Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: ""Allah’s 
    words (interpretation of the meaning) ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on 
    high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, when they 
    were consulted about the creation of Adam, and they disputed it and said: Do 
    not place a khaleefah (vicegerent) on earth.""
    Al-Sa’adi said: ""‘… The chiefs on high when they were disputing and 
    discussing’ means: ‘… when your Lord said to the angels: ""Verily, I am going 
    to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth""…’ [2:30]
    Qutadah said: ""The words ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they 
    were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, who disputed the 
    creation of Adam when Allah said to them, (interpretation of the meaning) 
    ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay’.” [38:71].
    As regards what was reported in the sunnah, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased 
    with him and his father) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah spoke to him in a dream and 
    said, ""O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high are disputing about?… 
    about the things which expiate for sins. Things that expiate for sins are: 
    staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational 
    prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so. Whoever 
    does these things will have a good life and die a good death, and he will be 
    as free from sin as on the day his mother bore him."" [Al-Tirmidhi])
    In his commentary on this hadeeth (narration), al-Mubarakpuri explained that 
    ""the chiefs on high"" (al-mala al-a’ala) referred to the angels who are 
    closest to Allah. Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at 
    their head because of their high status. They are described as al-a’ala 
    either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the 
    sight of Allah. Their ""dispute"" refers either to their competing or rushing 
    to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the 
    virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people 
    when they do these good deeds. It may have been called a ""dispute"" because 
    it came in the form of questions and answers, which sounds like a dispute or 
    a debate, hence it was appropriate to use the word ""dispute"" in this 
    context.

557,1875,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1875,Who    has the most right to lead the prayers?,"Question

 
I have a question regarding arrogance and becoming an imam.
In my community there are a few Muslims that always assume that they are the ""most noble and learned"" of the Muslims in the community and always assume the imam position in prayer, and never request that another brother go ahead. In fact, before the iqamah is recited these Muslims are already at the imam's mu-salla. The never request another brother to become imam, and one of them even said ""there is no one here more qualified than myself."" I do not know the exact reason why some of these Muslims feel that they are the most qualified, but I think it is because they feel that they are the oldest among the jama'ah or longest living in the community or even that they are of a particular nationality or dress.
I also know that there are some brothers who have alhamdulillah memorized much of the Qur'aan but they never want to become imam because they do not want to be associated or in competition with the arragant ones.
Please forgive me for this somewhat long message, but is it permissible or even preferred for these Muslims who may be learned to deny becoming the imam because of perhaps humility? Are these two situations (the assuming of becoming imam and the denying of it) two extremes that Allaah may be displeased with? If so, what should the people in the jama'ah do in this situation?",,"Praise be to Allah.Many saheeh ahadith have been narrated which explain to the Muslims who is most qualified and has the most right to lead the prayers. One of these ahadith is that which was narrated from Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
If there are three people, let one of them lead the others in prayer, and the one who has the most right to lead them is the one who knows more Quran.
(Narrated by Muslim, no. 1077).
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
The people should be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Quran and has been reciting it for longer. If they are equal in their knowledge and reading of the Quran, then they should be led by the one who made hijrah first. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, then they should be led by the one who is older
(Narrated by Muslim, 1079).
To sum up what is indicated by these ahadith, the one who has the most right to lead the others in prayer is: the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allah and of the fiqh of salah.
Those who knew more of the Book of Allah were appointed to lead the prayers at the time of the Sahaabah, because they had learned the correct way of reciting the aayat and they had learned the knowledge contained therein and the deeds prescribed by the Quran. So they combined knowledge and action [they acted upon what they had learned], and did not stop at merely memorizing as is the case nowadays. How many people learn all or part of the Quran, take care to recite it properly and with a beautiful voice, but they do not know anything about the fiqh of salah.
If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Quran, then the one who knows more about the Sunnah should lead the prayer. If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Sunnah, then the one who made hijrah first should lead the prayer. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, or if this does not apply, then the one who is older should lead the prayer, as is indicated in the hadeeth of Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith, who said:
We came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we were young people, close in age. We stayed with him for twenty days, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was kind to us. When he thought that we were missing our families, he asked us about those whom we had left behind, and we told him. He said, Go back to your families and stay with them. Teach them and instruct them and he said some things I remembered and some that I forgot. And pray as you have seen me praying. When the time for prayer comes, let one of you call the Adhaan and let the oldest among you lead the prayer.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6705). If they are equal with regard to recitation of the Quran, knowledge and hijrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that the eldest of them should be appointed to lead the prayer. If they are equal in age, then the one who is most righteous (has most taqwaa) should be appointed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has al-Taqwaa (is one of the pious) [al-Hujuraat 49:13]. If they are equal in all regards, then they should draw lots, if there is a dispute.
Having a PhD or having lived the longest in the land of the kuffaar does not qualify a person to lead the prayers. The one who has memorized more Quran and has more knowledge of the fiqh of salah is the one who should be appointed. It is not right for Muslims to dispute over the leadership of the prayers on the basis of their personal whims and desires. They should appoint the person who is described by shareeah as being qualified to lead the prayers. We ask Allah to reform the Muslims."

Neither of the two customs which you mention have any basis in Islamic texts. We

innovated; every innovation is a bidah and every bidah is a going astray.
Know, may Allaah help me and you, that the reservation concerning this matter does 
not have to do with shaking hands with a Muslim brother or raising the hands in duaa 
to Allaah; it has to do with the timing of these two actions, following the prayer, and 
making them a regular habit. If one were to raise ones hands between the adhaan and 
the iqaamah, as is encouraged in the Sunnah, or shake hands when meeting ones 
brothers on the way into or out of the mosque, or when seeing a brother next to one

1. buy bonds, which will cover any problem with the contractor if he

First of all, thank you for your kind words of encouragement.
Secondly, buying bonds is a haraam riba-based (interest-based) transaction, as entering

should seek Allaah’s help and put your trust in Him, then choose a contractor who is 
known for his honesty. After careful study and consultation, draw up a contract which 
clearly states conditions. You may find that the system and courts in your country will 
ensure that you are given your rights should something untoward happen. We ask 
Allaah to help you and keep you safe. Remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of

                After Nikaah (if final ceremony is not done), are you allowed to meet each 
other, similarly travel together and are you allowed to shake hand and hug 
each other?",,"Praise be to Allah.
The answer is, yes, all of this is permitted, even if it happens before the wedding 
party, so long as the contract has been drawn up according to Sharee’ah, with a 
guardian and two witnesses, and the proposal has been given and accepted, and both 
parties consent to the marriage. And Allaah knows best."
567,1902,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1902,The      Black Stone,"Question

what's the importance of the BlackStone in Kaaba, what does represent ?",,"Praise be to Allah.There are a number of ahaadeeth etc. about the Black Stone which we will quote for our brother so that he may learn from them.
1.     The Black Stone was sent down by Allah to this earth from Paradise.
 It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Black Stone came down from Paradise.”
 (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; al-Nasaa’i, 2935. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi).
  2.     The Stone was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaa said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Black Stone came down from Paradise, it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; Ahmad, 2792. Classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/219. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar classed it as qawiy (strong) in Fath al-Baari, 3/462).
(a)     Al-Mubaarakfoori said in al-Marqaah: This means, the sins of the sons of Adam who touched the stone, caused it to turn black. The hadeeth should be taken at face value, because there is no reason not to, either narrated in a report or by virtue of common sense.
(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 3/525)
(b)    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Some heretics tried to criticize this hadeeth by saying: How come the sins of the mushrikeen turned it black and the worship of the people of Tawheed did not make it white?
I answer by quoting what Ibn Qutaybah said: If Allah had willed, that would have happened. But Allah has caused it to be the case that black usually changes other colours and its not itself changed, which is the opposite to what happens with white.
(c)     Al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: The fact that it is black is a lesson for those who have insight. If sins can have this effect on an inanimate rock, then the effect they have on the heart is greater.
See Fath al-Baari, 3/463
  3.     The Black Stone will come forth on the Day of Resurrection and will testify in favour of those who touched it in truth.
  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the Stone: “By Allah, Allah will bring it forth on the Day of Resurrection, and it will have two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak, and it will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity.”
  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 961; Ibn Maajah, 2944
  This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, and as qawiy by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari, 3/462
  (4)         Touching, kissing or pointing to the Black Stone – this is the first thing to be done when starting Tawaaf, whether it is for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or voluntary Tawaaf.
It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased  with him) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Makkaah, he came to the Black Stone and touched it, then he walked to the right of it and ran three times and walked four times [around the Ka’bah].
  (narrated by Muslim, 1218).
(5)              The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissed the Black Stone, and his ummah followed his lead in doing so.
  It was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Black Stone and kissed it, then he said: “I know that you are only a stone which can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you.”
  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1520; Muslim, 1720)
  (6)          If a person is unable to kiss the Stone, he should touch it with his hand or something else, then he can kiss the thing with which he touched it.
(a)    It was narrated that Naafi’ said: I saw Ibn ‘Umar touch the Stone with his hand then he kissed his hand. I said, I have never ceased to do this since I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do it.
(Narrated by Muslim, 1268)
(b)    It was narrated that Abu Tufayl (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performing Tawaaf around the House, touching the corner [where the Stone is] with a crooked staff which he had with him, then kissing the staff.
(Narrated by Muslim, 1275).
(7)   If a person is unable to do the above, then he can point to it with his hand and say “Allahu akbar”.
  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed Tawaaf on his camel, and every time he came to the corner [where the Stone is] he would point to it and say “Allahu akbar.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4987).
  (8)  Touching the Stone is one of the things by means of which Allah expiates for sins
  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Touching them both [the Black Stone and al-Rukn al-Yamani] is an expiation for sins.”
  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 959. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh by al-Haakim (1/664). Al-Dhahabi agreed with him).
  It is not permissible for a Muslim to annoy other Muslims at the Stone by hitting or fighting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that the Stone will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity, which is not the case when a person touches it by disturbing the slaves of Allah.
  And Allah knows best."

569,1913,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1913,"Is it permissible for a woman to slaughter an animal, and can the meat of an animal she slaughters be eaten?","Question

                My wife asked me an interesting question:Did any of the sahabiyyat ever slaughter an animal   during the `eid?Is this a proof that women can slaughter an animal if indeed any
  of the sahabiyyat slaughtered?",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars of Islam are agreed that it is permissible 
  to eat the meat of an animal slaughtered by a woman, because of the general 
  terms used in the wording of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Among the evidence 
  that it is permissible are the following:
The aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
    “Forbidden for you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals – 
    cattle-beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and the meat of 
    that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah, or 
    has been slaughtered for idols, etc., or on which Allaah’s Name has mot 
    been mentioned while slaughtering, and that which has been killed by strangling, 
    or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns – 
    and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal – unless you 
    are able to slaughter it (before its death)…” 
    [al-Maa’idah 5:3]. The evidence in this aayah is the phrase where 
    Allaah has permitted us to eat of any animal that we are able to slaughter 
    before it dies; this is general in application, and does not specify as to 
    whether the person who manages to do this is a man or a woman – so it 
    could be either.
 
  Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh 
    from ‘Ubayd-Allaah from Naafi’, that he (Naafi’) heard Ibn 
    Ka’b ibn Maalik narrating from his father that they used to have sheep 
    which they allowed to graze on the mountain of Sala’ in Madeenah: one 
    of the slave-women noticed that one of the sheep was dying, so she broke a 
    stone and slaughtered it. He said: “Do not eat it until I ask the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or 
    I send someone to ask him. So he asked the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or sent someone else to ask, 
    and he told him to eat it. ‘Ubay-Allaah said: “I liked the fact 
    that she was a slave-woman and she managed to slaughter it.”
  
 
Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on 
  him) said: “This shows that it is permitted to eat meat slaughtered by 
  a woman, whether she is free or a slave, old or young, Muslim or of the People 
  of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian), in a state of purity or otherwise, 
  because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
  be upon him) told them to eat the meat she had slaughtered and did not ask for 
  further details.”
This hadeeth also answers the question about whether any of the 
  Sahaabiyaat (female Companions of the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) slaughtered animals.
The discussion above also makes it clear that a woman may slaughter 
  animals, because of the general terms used in the texts, and there is no difference 
  in this regard between meat slaughtered as a sacrifice or meat slaughtered for 
  regular food.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “It is permitted to eat from an animal 
  which a man or a woman slaughters Islamically before it dies, or from meat slaughtered 
  by a woman, even if she is menstruating, because her menstruation is not in 
  her hand. It is permissible to eat meat from an animal which a woman slaughters 
  Islamically before it dies, by the consensus of the Muslims.” (Al-Fataawa, 
  35/234)."
570,1916,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1916,Will We See Allah on the Day of Judgment?,"Question

Where is Allah?  Can we meet Allah on the last Judgment day?","As for meeting Allah and seeing Him, meeting Him occurs after death and on the Day of Judgment; seeing Him will occur only on the Day of Judgment.","Praise be to Allah.Where is Allah?
Evidence in the Quran and Sunnah points to the fact that Allah is above the heavens , established over His Throne in a manner that befits His Majesty and Greatness. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
""The Most Beneficent Istawa (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)."" [Ta Ha 20:5]
Will We See Allah on the Day of Judgment?
As for meeting Allah and seeing Him, meeting Him occurs after death and on the Day of Judgment; seeing Him will occur only on the Day of Judgment. 
Concerning the meeting with Allah after death, Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih, in the chapter on ""whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him"":
From `Ubadah ibn As-Samit, from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) who said: ""Whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah will love to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah will hate to meet him."" `Aishah or one of his wives said: ""But we all dislike the idea of death."" He said, ""It is not what you are thinking. When death approaches the believer and he is given the news of Allah’s pleasure and honour, nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him, so he will love to meet Allah and Allah will love to meet him. But when death approaches the disbeliever and he is given the news of Allah’s wrath and punishment, nothing will be more disliked by him that what lies ahead of him, so he will hate to meet Allah and Allah will hate to meet him."" (Al-Bukhari, 6026)
The words ""nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him"" refer to what he will go through after death. Muslim and An-Nisa’i report that Shurayh ibn Hani’ (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""I said to `Aishah: `I have heard a Hadith which, if it is as I heard it, means that we are doomed. The Hadith says: ""There is not one of us who does not dislike death.""’ She said: `It is not what you think. What it means is when a person’s eyes stare without blinking, when the death rattle is in his chest and his skin and muscles contract.’ This is the state of one who is dying.
""Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""There are different types of meeting: it may mean seeing with one’s own eyes, or it may mean resurrection, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):`They indeed are losers who denied their meeting with Allah…’ [Al-An`am 6:31]; or it may mean death, as Allah says: (interpretation of the meaning): `Whoever hopes for the Meeting with Allah, then Allah’s term is surely coming…’ [Al-`Ankabut 29:5] and `Say (to them): Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you…’ [Al-Jumu`ah 62:8]""
The meeting with Allah (mentioned in the Hadith quoted above) refers to something other than death, because in another Hadith the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, ""Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allah."" But when death is the means of meeting Allah, it is described as the meeting with Allah. 
Imam Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim ibn Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The Hadith does not refer to a dislike of death and the suffering involved, because everybody feels this way. What is being criticised here is a love and preference for this world and a dislike of the idea of moving on to Allah and the Hereafter. This is explained by the fact that Allah condemned people who love this life, and said (interpretation of the meaning): `… those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world…’ [Yunus 10:7].""
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The meaning of the Hadith is that the like and dislike referred to are those that occur at the time of death, at the stage when repentance is no longer acceptable, when the dying person is shown where he is headed.” 
There is also some discussion in the Hadith about the dislike of death. Whoever dislikes death because he prefers this life to the blessings of the Hereafter is condemned. Whoever dislikes death because he fears being brought to account for his shortcomings, lack of preparation and failure to carry out the commands of Allah properly, is not to blame in this case. The one who feels this way should hasten to prepare himself so that when death comes to him he will not dislike it but will love it because of the meeting with Allah which he is hoping for after death.
The Hadith quoted above also indicates that no living person will see Allah in this life, but that the believers will see Him after death, as the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allah."" This fact is stated even more clearly in another Hadith narrated by Muslim from Abu Umamah, in which the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) says: ""Know that you will not see your Lord until you die."" The meeting with Allah and seeing Him on the Day of Judgment is proven in many texts, such as the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
""Some faces that Day will be shining and radiant, looking at their Lord."" [Al-Qiyamah 75:22-23] Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the people said, ""O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection ?"" He said, ""Do you have any doubts about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night?"" They said, ""No."" He said, ""Do you have any doubts about seeing the sun on a cloudless day?"" They said, ""No."" He said, ""Then you will see your Lord in the same way."" (Al-Bukhari, 764)
We ask Allah to let us meet Him when He is pleased with us. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.
And Allah knows best."
571,1917,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1917,Wants to embrace Islam but is married to a non-Muslim,"Question

I have been practicing Islam for a while now and I want to insha-Allah embrace it but there are serious problems that I am encountering. My husband and I have been having marital problems for a while now and even though things are going alright I don't trust that it would be like this forever because he has these violent ourbursts of rage and I have seriously considered divorcing him after I was advised to do so by our councellor.
The problem is that I don't love him anymore and moreover he won't allow me to embrace Islam and he refuses to embrace it as well. He said that we would rather break up rather than me becoming Muslim. The other problem is that I have two daughters who are attending a Hindu School and what does the Sharia say about what happens after I convert with regards to my daughters. I have met a wonderful Muslim man and we love each other very much and he asked me twice already to marry him. I did not go to bed with him and that is not our intention. We love each other for who we are and he is willing to accept my children if they convert as well. He said that he will wait until the end of the year before he goes on with his life because there are other women who he can settle down with but I am his first preference.

Please advice me and in English please because I do not understand Arabic. I need to take action about so many things, yet I feel guilty and I feel sorry for my husband because he is trying to make our marraige to work. Unfortunately the religion is a big problem.

Your urgent help and co operation will be highly appeciated.

Jazak Allah",,"Praise be to Allah. 

Your husband is preventing you from embracing Islam, and does not want to become Muslim himself. He prefers divorce to Islam, although you have tried to persuade him of the truth to no avail. This means that this man is no good. Moreover, you say that he is bad-tempered and violent, that any improvement is only temporary, and that you do not love him at all. If this man is as you say, he is no good from either a religious or a worldly point of view, and there is no use in staying with him. Our advice to you in this case is to leave him immediately, and try hard to gain custody of your two daughters so that they may grow up in Islam. According to Islamic shareeah, in such cases custody should be awarded to the Muslim parent, because Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over.

As regards the second part of your question, and this man whom you say is a Muslim, you must make sure that he is a chaste man, not one who is immoral or corrupt. Do not establish any relationship with him before marriage. If you find out for sure that he is chaste and solidly religious, I advise you to marry him as soon as your iddah (waiting period after divorce) is over. I ask Allaah to take care of you by His mercy, to make the right thing easy for you, to help you enter this religion and to save you from kufr and its followers. Remember the story of Pharaohs wife, who was Muslim although her husband was a kaafir. Allaah said about her (interpretation of the meaning):
""And Allaah sets forth an example for those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh, when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his work, and save me from the people who are zaalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allaah)."" [al-Tahreem 66:11]

572,1919,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1919,Is All Seafood Halal?,"Question

 
Please forgive me for my ignorance in this matter. I am very interested in learning the ways of Islam. My question concerns dietary rulings. What types of fish and seafood are permissible?
Thank you for your help.","All kinds of food from the sea are permissible, whether they are plants or animals, alive or dead. There are certain types of water animals which are forbidden such as crocodiles, frogs, otters and turtles. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.Islam: Easy to follow
Among the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us is the fact that He has made our religion easy for us, and has not made it too difficult or unbearable. He has allowed us many things that were forbidden according to previously-revealed laws. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Is seafood halal?
Hence all kinds of food from the sea are permissible, whether they are plants or animals, alive or dead. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food – for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel…” [al-Maidah 5:96]. Ibn 'Abbas said: “ Sayduhu (lit. hunting, pursuit) refers to whatever is taken from it alive, and ta’amuhu (lit. its food) means whatever is taken dead.”
Forbidden water animals
There are a few things – certain types of water animals – which some scholars exclude from the permission outlined above. These are:
1- Crocodiles: The correct view is that eating these is not allowed, because they have fangs and live on land – even though they may spend a lot of time in the water – so precedence should be given to the reason for forbidding it (it is a land animal that has fangs).
2- Frogs: It is not permitted to eat them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade killing them, as is reported in the hadith of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Uthman, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the killing of frogs. (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 6970). 
The rule is that everything which we are forbidden to kill, we are not allowed to eat; if we are allowed to eat it we are allowed to kill it.
Some scholars exclude sea snakes, but the correct view is that as they live nowhere except in the water, we are permitted to eat them, because of the general nature of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food – for the benefit of yourselves …” [al-Maidah 5:96]
3- Otters and turtles: The correct view is that to be on the safe side, it is permissible to eat them after slaughtering them properly, because they live both on land and in the sea. 
Here the rule is that in the case of animals that live both on land and in the sea, the rules concerning land animals should be given precedence, to be on the safe side, so they must be slaughtered properly, except for crabs which do not need to be slaughtered, even though they live both on land and in the sea, because they do not have blood.
Everything that can cause harm is forbidden as food, even if it comes from the sea, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [al-Nisa 4:29] and: “… and do not throw yourselves into destruction…” [al-Baqarah 2:195]
(See al-Mughni, 11/83; Hashiyah al-Rawd, 7/430; Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 3/197; and Ahkam al-At’imah by al-Fawzan).

Tuba tree
Tree of Life
Tree of Knowledge
The Cosmic Tree
The Fartherest Tree of the Heavens
These trees are mentioned in muslim literature and I am looking for their credibility
Jazak Allah Khairun",,"Praise be to Allah. 

A number of trees are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, some of which will be discussed below:

The date palm tree

This is a good tree to which Allaah likened the word of Tawheed when it is established in the sincere heart, where it bears fruits of good deeds that strengthen eemaan (faith).

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""See you not how Allaah sets forth a parable? – A goodly word is as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e., very high)."" [Ibraaheem 14:24]

This is the tree to which Allaah likens the believer because it is good in all aspects, it is lasting and it offers different kinds of benefit. Ibn ‘Umar reported: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There is a kind of tree whose leaves do not fall and it is like the Muslim. Tell me what it is.’ The people mentioned different kinds of desert trees … and I said to myself, ‘It is the date palm tree,’ but I felt too shy to speak up. Then the people said, ‘Tell us what it is, O Messenger of Allaah.’ He said: ‘It is the date palm tree.’"" (al-Bukhaari, 60)

The blessed olive tree the purity of which Allaah set forth as a parable

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Allaah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e., it neither gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e., nor does it get sun-rays only in the afternoon – but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allaah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allaah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allaah is All-Knower of everything."" [al-Noor 24:35]

In Soorat al-Mu’minoon, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And a tree (olive) that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters."" [al-Mu’minoon 23:20]

Abu Aseed said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Eat the oil and use it on your hair and skin, for it comes from a blessed tree."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1775; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’)

The tree which Allaah caused to grow for Yoonus (upon whom be peace) for food and healing.
 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And, verily, Yoonus was one of the Messengers … Then a (big) fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame. Had he not been of those who glorify Allaah, he would have indeed remained inside its belly until the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick, and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him."" [al-Saaffaat 37:139, 142-146]

The mufassireen (commentators) said: The gourd (al-yaqteen) is a kind of pumpkin. Some of them described the benefits of the pumpkin, such as: it grows quickly, it provides shade, it has large, smooth leaves, it keeps flies away and its fruit provides good nourishment: it can be eaten raw or cooked, and its skin may be eaten too. It is known that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) liked this kind of pumpkin and used to look for it on the plate of food. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).

The great tree in heaven where our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw his father Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace)

Samurah ibn Jundub reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, describing his vision: ""Then we went up until we reached a green garden, in which there was a great tree, with an old man and children at its base, and another man near the tree, trying to light a fire in front of him. They took me up to that tree and into a house; I have never seen any more beautiful than that house. In it there were men, old men, youths, women and children. Then they brought me out and took me up to the tree and into another house, even better than the first one. In this house there were old and young men. I said: ‘You have shown me around tonight; tell me about what I have seen.’ They said, ‘Yes… the old man at the foot of the tree was Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace), and the children around him were the children of mankind…"" (al-Bukhaari, 1270).

Sidrat al-Muntaha, by which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Jibreel when he was taken up into the heavens

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And indeed he (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him (Jibreel) at a second descent (i.e., another time), near Sidrat al-Muntaha (the lote tree of the utmost boundary, beyond which none can pass), near it is the Paradise of Abode, when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it! The sight (of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) turned not aside (right or left), nor did it transgress beyond (the) limit (ordained for it). Indeed, he did see of the Greatest Signs of his Lord (Allaah)."" [al-Najm 53:13-18]

The phrase translated here as ""when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it"" is explained by the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from Abu Dharr, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""It was covered in colours, I do not know what they are…"" According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Sa’eed and Ibn ‘Abbaas, he said: ""It was covered by the angels."" According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: ""When it was covered with whatever covered it by the command of Allaah, it changed, and none of the creation of Allaah could describe its beauty.""

In the famous hadeeth about his Mi’raaj (ascent into heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that when Jibreel took him up into the heavens, he went through from one heaven to the next by the command of Allaah, until he reached the seventh heaven. He said: ""Then I was taken to Sidrat al-Muntaha; its fruits were like the pitchers of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. He said, ‘This is Sidrat al-Muntaha’…"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3598).

The reason why it is called Sidrat al-Muntaha is stated in the hadeeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood by Imaam Muslim: ""There everything that comes up from earth stops (yantahee), and it is taken from there, and there everything that comes down stops, and it is taken from there."" Al-Nawawi said: It is called Sidrat al-Muntaha because the knowledge of the angels stops at that point, and no one has gone beyond it except the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

It is the tree at which the knowledge of every Prophet who has been sent and every angel who is near to Allaah stops. What lies beyond it is unseen; no one knows it except Allaah or the one to whom He tells it. It was said that this is the ultimate destination of the souls of the martyrs.

The fruits described in the hadeeth are well known: they are the fruits of the lotus tree. Al-Khattaabi said that the phrase ""like the pitchers of Hajar"" meant that they were big like pitchers; this is something that was known to the first listeners, which is why this analogy was used. Hajar is a place-name. The phrase ""its leaves were like the ears of elephants"" is also indicative of huge size.

The Tree of Tooba in Paradise

Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""In Paradise there is a tree in whose shade a rider could travel for a hundred years without crossing it. Recite, if you wish: ‘In shade long-extended’ [al-Waaqi’ah 56:30]"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4502)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Tooba is a tree in Paradise, one hundred years big. The clothes of the people of Paradise are made from its calyces (outer casing of its flowers)."" (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3918)

‘Utbah ibn ‘Abdin al-Salami said: ""A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him about al-Hawd (the cistern). He mentioned Paradise, then the Bedouin asked him, ‘Is there fruit there?’ He said, ‘Yes, and there is a tree called Tooba.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘What tree of this world does it resemble?’ He said, ‘It does not resemble any tree of your land. Have you been to Syria?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘It resembles a tree in Syria called al-Jawzah (walnut) which grows on one trunk then spreads its branches higher up.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘How big is its trunk?’ He said, ‘If one of the camels of your people was to go around it, it would not complete one circuit before its neck broke of old age and exhaustion. The Bedouin asked, ‘Are there grapes there?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He asked, ‘How big is a bunch?’ He said, ‘The distance a crow could fly without stopping in a month.’ He asked, ‘How big is one grape?’ He said, ‘Does your father ever slaughter a he-goat from his flocks?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘And does he skin it and give the hide to your mother, and say, ""Make me a bucket""?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘Is one grape big enough to satisfy me and my family?’ He said, ‘Yes, and your whole tribe.’"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad).

The tree of Zaqqoom, which is the food of the people of Hell

This tree is described in the Qur’aan as (interpretation of the meaning): ""… the accursed tree (mentioned) in the Qur’aan"" [al-Israa’ 17:60].
Allaah also says about it (interpretation of the meaning):

""Then, moreover, verily, - you the erring-ones, the deniers (of Resurrection)! You verily will eat of the trees of Zaqqoom. Then you will fill your bellies therewith, and drink boiling water on top of it, so you will drink (that) like thirsty camels! That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!"" [al-Waaqi’ah 56:51-56]

""Verily, the tree of Zaqqoom, will be the food of the sinners, like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said): ‘Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water, taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be the mighty, the generous! Verily! This is that whereof you used to doubt!’"" [al-Dukhaan 44:43-50]

""Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqoom (a horrible tree in Hell)? Truly We have made it (as) a trial for the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disbelievers, wrongdoers, etc.). Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire, the shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of shayaateen (devils); truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture (of boiling water and Zaqqoom in their bellies). Then, thereafter, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell."" [al-Saafaat 37:62-68]

The tree under which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted his Companions’ pledge of allegiance unto death and not to desert him.
This happened during the campaign of al-Hudaybiyah, when he heard of the betrayal of the mushrikeen. This tree is also mentioned in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
""Indeed, Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bay’ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) under the tree…"" [al-Fath 48:18]

The tree next to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to preach

Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullaah (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go and stand next to a tree or palm-tree on Fridays. A woman or a man of the Ansaar said: ""O Messenger of Allaah, should we not make for you a minbar (""pulpit"")?"" He said, ""If you wish."" So they made a minbar for him, and when the next Friday came, he was shown to the minbar. The tree cried like a small child, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came down and hugged the crying tree until it calmed down."" Jaabir said: ""It was crying because of the dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) that it used to hear."" (al-Bukhaari, 3319).

The tree from which Allaah spoke to Moosa (upon whom be peace) and sent him as a Prophet

Allaah says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
""So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree: ‘O Moosa! Verily! I am Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)!"" [al-Qasas 28:30]

The tree from which Allaah forbade our father and mother (Aadam and Hawwa) to eat

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree, otherwise you both will be of the Zaalimoon (unjust and wrong-doers)."" [al-A’raaf 7:19]

""Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: ‘O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?"" [Ta-Ha 20:120]

""So He misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). And their Lord called out to them (saying): ‘Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily Shaytaan is an open enemy to you?’"" [al-A’raaf 7:22]

The cedar tree to which Allaah likened the kaafir (disbeliever)

Abu Hurayrah said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The example of the believer is like that of a plant which is continually bent over by the wind; the believer is continually beset with afflictions. The example of a hypocrite is like that of the cedar tree, which does not yield until it is uprooted in one go."" (Muslim, 5024)

The scholars of Arabic language said: the cedar (al-arz) is a tree similar to the stone pine tree, which grows in Syria and Armenia. According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The example of the kaafir is that of the firmly-rooted cedar which does not yield to anything until it is uprooted in one go.""

The scholars said: The meaning of this hadeeth is that the believer suffers a great deal, in his physical health, with his family and with his wealth, but this is an expiation for his sins and will raise his status. The kaafir, however, suffers little, but even if something happens to him it will not expiate for his sins at all; he will come with a full burden of sin on the Day of Resurrection.

The tree in the righteous vision that was narrated concerning the sajdah (prostration) to be performed when reciting certain aayaat of the Qur’aan

Ibn ‘Abbaas said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allaah, last night I had a dream in which it was as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated and the tree prostrated after me. I heard it saying: ‘Allaahumma uktub li bihaa ‘indaka ajran wada’ ‘anni bihaa wizran waj’alhaa li ‘indaka dhukhran wa taqabbalha minni kamaa taqabbaltahaa min ‘abdika Daawood (O Allaah, record for me because of it (the sajdah) a reward, alleviate some of my burden, and make it an investment on my behalf with You. Accept it from me as You accepted it from Your slave Daawood).’"" Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited an aayah where a sajdah is required, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had reported that the tree had said. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 528)

The two trees which came together to conceal the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was answering the call of nature

This was recorded in the saheeh report narrated by Imaam Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him): ""… We stopped in a fragrant valley, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature. I followed him, bringing a bottle of water, but he could not find anywhere where he could conceal himself. There were two trees at the edge of the valley, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to one of them, took hold of one of its branches, and said: ‘Follow me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So it followed him like a camel being led by a rope, until he came to the other tree. He took one of the other tree’s branches and said: ‘Follow me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So it followed him until he reached the halfway point between them, then he put them together and said: ‘Stay together and cover me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So they stayed together."" Jaabir said: ""I kept away, for fear that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might feel my presence and move even further away. So I sat down, thinking to myself, and when I turned around, I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) coming towards me, and the two trees had separated and taken up their former positions."" (Saheeh Muslim, 5328)

Trees (plants) with foul-smelling ""fruits"" after eating which the Muslims are forbidden to come to the mosque

Jaabir said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever eats of these vegetables (the first time he said ‘garlic,’ then ‘garlic, onions and leeks’), let him not come near us in our mosques, for the angels will be offended by whatever offends the people.’"" (al-Nisaa’i, 700)

The trees (all except the gharqad) which will show the Jews to the Muslims so that they may kill them during the great battle at the end of time

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will say: ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jews behind me, come and kill him!’ (All the trees will say this except for the gharqad (box-thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.’"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; it is a saheeh hadeeth).

These are a number of the trees mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, from which we may learn many lessons. We ask Allaah to help us benefit from these lessons. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

My question is that in some cultures people are fond of eating raw meat. I would like to know if there is any Islamic ruling on that? Meaning whether it is ok or not.","Some scholars said that it is disliked to eat raw meat, but the correct view is that it is permissible because all things are permitted except those which have been expressly forbidden.","Praise be to Allah.Some scholars said that it is disliked to eat raw meat, but the correct view is that it is permissible, on the basis of the principle that all things are permitted except those which have been expressly forbidden. 
There is no evidence to suggest that this is forbidden, but it is allowed on the condition that no harm is caused to the person who eats it – in which case it would not be allowed, because everything that causes harm is prohibited, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and do not throw yourselves into destruction…” [Al-Baqarah 2:195]

                I understand one of the causes that make ghusl a must are:
1. The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) said: ""What requires water (ghusl) is if you see water 
(i.e., semen) coming out of you."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1/269) .
My question is: like my case sometimes I see semen emitting with my urine 
and I confirmed that it is a semen as recently I have done a medical check 
and found trace of semen in my urine. Is it compulsory for me to perform 
ghusl when I see semen emit with my urine?
I am really appericiate this website because a lot of the questions
and answers make me more convinced to practice Islam in my life.
Thank you very much",,"Praise be to Allah.
The emission of semen due to enjoyment or a ""wet dream"" requires ghusl, but if semen 
is emitted in the urine or because of sickness, with no pleasure involved, this does not 
require ghusl. All you have to do is clean yourself properly after passing urine or 
stools, and perform wudoo’ before praying. This is sufficient,

577,1930,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1930,Doubts of one who is interested in Islam,"Question

I am a non-Muslim who is very much interested in Islam. I have been trying to do research on my own.
However, I came upon some information that I found rather disturbing.
It is regarding the Kaaba and the origin of Islam. I was told that Abraham and Ishmael removed all the idols from the Kaaba, but there was one in particular who's name meant ""diety"". I read that this is where the name ""Allah"" came from and that this diety was the pagan Moon god.
His symbol is the crescent moon and Ramadhan is scheduled around lunar activity. I would like an answer to whether or not such a religion existed and is Islam really connected to this pagan practice?",,"Praise be to Allah.Welcome to a lady who is seeking the true religion and is interested in Islam. We ask Allaah to show you the truth and help you to follow it, and to protect you from Shaytaan and his doubts, and the misguidance of the enemies of Islam.

Before I answer your question, I would like to remind you that the way to find out the truth about a religion is to refer to its authentic sources, which in the case of Islam means the Quraan, which is the Word of Allaah, and the Sunnah, which is the words of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to whom Allaah sent Revelation.

One of the mistakes made by some of those who investigate Islam is to refer to sources that are not authentic or material written by those who have ulterior motives and who are enemies of Islam spreading lies about it, to put people off and lead them astray from the Way of Allaah.

Turning to your question about the Kabah, and Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel (upon whom be peace), it is very strange to say that they removed all the idols from the Kabah except one. This contradicts the historical facts, and does not make sense, because it is known that Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel were the ones who built the Kabah, on the command of Allaah how could they then have taken idols out of it? How could there have been any idols in it when they were supervising its construction and maintenance by remembering Allaah and calling people to perform Tawaaf around it and come on pilgrimage to it only for the sake of Allaah? The idols came many years afterwards, when some of the Arabs travelled to the kaafir lands outside the Arabian Peninsula and brought back idols, some of which were placed around the Kabah. Then the mushrikeen added more idols until there were 360 of them around the Kabah. This remained the case until Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This was the dawning of the light of Tawheed which drove out the darkness of idolatry. Through him, Allaah defeated the mushrikeen; he broke the idols and purified the Sacred House, thus restoring the Kabah to the pure worship of the One God, as it had been at the time of his forefather Ibraaheem, the Friend (Khaleel) of Allaah.

There follows an account of the building of the Ancient House, from the Quraan and the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We will begin by quoting from the Quraan, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

""And (remember) when Ibraaheem said: My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allaah and the Last Day. He (Allaah) answered, As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!
And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaaeel were raising the foundations of the House (the Kabah), (saying): Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.
Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our manaasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage Hajj and Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.
Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book and al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood, etc.), and sanctify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.""
[al-Baqarah 2:126-129]

""And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the (Sacred) House, (saying): Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allaah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.)
And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).""
[al-Hajj 22:26-27]

As regards the story of the construction of the Kabah in the Sunnah, Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaaeel. In his report, he said:
"" Ibraaheem brought her and her son Ismaaeel, while she was still breast-feeding him, and left them in a place near the Kabah (meaning near the place where the Kabah was later built) under a tree on the spot of Zamzam (meaning the place where Zamzam later appeared), at the highest place in the mosque. In those days there was no-one in Makkah nor was there any water. So he left them there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a water-skin containing some water, then he set off for home. Ismaaeels mother followed him and said: O Ibraaheem, where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)? She said this many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, Has Allaah commanded you to do this? He said, Yes. She said, Then He will not forsake us, and returned, while Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaaniyah, where they could not see him, he turned to face the Kabah, raised his hands and offered the supplication: O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivable valley, by Your Sacred House in order, O Our Lord, that they may perform al-Salaat (iqaamat al-salaat), so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks. [Ibraaheem 14:37]

Ismaaeels mother went on suckling Ismaaeel and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him tossing in agony; she left him because she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safaa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safaa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the mountain of al-Marwa, where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safaa and al-Marwa) seven times."" Ibn Abbaas said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: This is the origin of the tradition of al-Saee (the walking) of people between them (al-Safaa and al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time), she heard a voice and she made herself quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me? And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hands in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water from her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: ""May Allaah bestow mercy on Ismaaeels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: ""Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angels said to her: Dont be afraid of being forsaken, for this is the House of Allaah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allaah never forsakes His people. The House at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way until some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kadaa. They stopped and stayed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, although we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them about it. So, they all came (towards the water)."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: ""Ismaaeels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you? She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: ""Ismaaeels mother was pleased with the whole situation, as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (Ismaaeel) grew up and learnt Arabic from them, and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up. When he reached the age of puberty, they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ismaaeels mother had died, Ibraaheem came after Ismaaeels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before Then Ibraaheem came and saw Ismaaeel under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome him and they greeted one another as a father greets his son or a son greets his father. Ibraaheem said, O Ismaaeel, Allaah has given me an order. Ismaaeel said: Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Ibraaheem asked, Will you help me? Ismaaeel said, I will help you. Ibraaheem said, Allaah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: ""Then they raised the foundations of the House (Kabah). Ismaaeel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, and when the walls became high, Ismaaeel brought this stone and put it for Ibraaheem, who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaaeel was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying: Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. [al-Baqarah 2:127]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, ""Then both of them went on building and going around the Kabah saying, Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."" (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3113)

Having outlined the historical details of the building of the Kabah, we move on to the idea mentioned in your question that the name of Allaah was derived from the name of an idol. This is an extremely odd idea. How can the name of the Creator, the Evolver, the First, the Almighty, the Compellor be derived from the name of a created idol that could neither benefit nor harm anyone?

Allaah says, rebuking the mushrikeen (polytheists) (interpretation of the meaning): ""Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead."" [al-Furqaan 25:3]

""You worship besides Allaah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back."" [al-Ankaboot 29:17]

Allaah describes how Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) rebuked his father and his people for worshipping idols (interpretation of the meaning):
""When he said to his father: O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?"" [Maryam 19:42]

""And recite to them the story of Ibraaheem, when he said to his father and his people: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted. He said, Do they hear you, when you call (on them)? Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)? They said, Nay, but we found our fathers doing so. He said, Do you observe that which you have been worshipping, - you and your ancient fathers? Verily! They are enemies to me, save the Lord of the Aalameen (makind, jinn and everything that exists), Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me."" [Al-Shuaraa 26:69-78]

Concerning Ibraaheems destruction of his peoples idols, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Then he turned to their gods and said, Will you not eat (of the offering before you)? What is the matter with you that you speak not? Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand. Then they (the worshippers of idols) came towards him, hastening. He said, Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve? While Allaah has created you and what you make?"" [al-Saaffaat 37:91-96]

After reading all this, how can it be said that Ibraaheem left one idol near the Kabah, and that the name of Allaah is derived from the name of an idol? Do you know what ""Allaah"" means and where this name is derived from?

The blessed name ""Allaah"" is derived from the Arabic verb alaha/yalahu/malooh [the root of which is the three letters alif, laam, haa]. This verb includes the meaning of love as well as worship. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the One Who is loved, glorified and feared by the believers, and they put their hope in Him.

As regards to your last question, about whether Islam has anything to do with the worship of idols or heavenly bodies, this is a strange matter indeed. Islam proclaimed the absolute unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and taught that He Alone is to be worshipped, with no partners or associates. Islam came to fight idolatry and put an end to it, so how can it possibly be connected to idol-worship?

Perhaps you have read in the Quraan the story of the hoopoe who believed only in Allaah; he knew Who his Lord was, and denounced the worship of stars and planets. Allaah says, relating how His Prophet Sulaymaan (upon whom be peace) conveyed the story to the queen of Yemen at that time (interpretation of the meaning):

""[The hoopoe said] and I have come to you from Saba (Sheba) with true news. I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given all things that could be possessed by any ruler of the earth, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allaah, and Shaytaan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and has barred them from (Allaahs) Way, so they have no guidance, so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allaah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!"" [al-Naml 27:22-26]

There is also the story of how Ibraaheem rebuked his people for worshipping heavenly bodies, the sun and moon, which Allaah has told us in Soorat al-Anaam (the sixth soorah).

The fast of Ramadaan is not connected to the moon because we worship the moon, but because the Lord of the moon has made it a marker of time for us, by which we may organize our worship and other affairs. So we look for the new moon of Ramadaan so that we may worship Allaah Alone by fasting, and we look for the new moon of the following month to mark the end of this annual act of worship. We also look for the timings of Hajj and other acts of worship in a similar way.

We hope that this has helped you understand anything that was not clear to you before. Note that this is a serious issue, and it is not something to be taken lightly. The only religion with Allaah is Islam, which He has chosen for His slaves, and He will not accept any other religion. Come and join the religion of truth, and follow what your Lord has revealed."

                Asalamu Alaikum,
, by Allah's (swt) Grace and Mercy I have recently begun 
practicing Islam, may Allah bless you for establishing a light on the 
Internet when there is so much darkness and evil present on it.
I am a little confused about what foods are haram/halal. What to do when 
'people of the book' offer meat (besides pork) to us? 
Also, I have heard that certain ingredients in food may be derived from 
animals, such as mono- and diglycerides, lecithin, gelatin, etc. Are these 
permissible to eat?
As well, I have heard certain chocolate bars have trace amounts of alcohol 
in them. But they are so small that there is no way of being even slightly 
intoxicated from them.
Please clarify these issues, Allah-willing.
Jazak-Allah",,"Praise be to Allah.Who has guided you to follow His laws and religion. 
  We ask Allaah to give you and us even more of His Bounty.
  In response to your question, there is nothing wrong with eating any halaal 
  food offered to us by the People of the Book, so long as it is not mixed with 
  haraam like pork and so on. As regards sweets that contain unchanged alcohol, 
  we are not permitted to eat them, whether the alcohol in them is in big amounts 
  or only a little. The answer to the remainder of your question may be found

                Assalaamu'alaikum! Ya Sheikh, I have a very important question to ask 
you and this will Insha'Allah benefit many other Muslims. A friend of mine 
was telling me that a wife cannot come in front of the husband's brother as 
he is not her Mahram. My question is this: I live with my parents and 
brother and sister. I and my brother pay the rent of the apartment. 
Insha'Allah we are going to move to a rented house which will be bigger 
and the rent will be payed by me and my brother. I had thought of getting 
married because of the bigger house, but I don't know whether I could do 
this now unless I get my own separate house. Please answer my question 
as soon as possible, Jazakumulah Khyran",,"Praise be to Allah.
  There is no harm in you and your wife living in one house with the rest of the 
  family members you mentioned. All that you have to be careful about is that 
  your wife does not go out in front of your brother or be alone with him in the 
  house, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) forbade non-mahrams (unrelated men) to enter upon women. 
  He said: ""Beware of entering upon women."" One of the Sahaabah said 
  to him, ""O Messenger of Allaah, what about the brother-in-law?"" He 
  said: ""The brother-in-law is death!"" (Reported 
  by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330).
  Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""What is referred to in 
  the hadeeth is all the husbands (male) relatives apart from his father 
  and sons. People customarily take the matter of a man being alone with his brothers 
  wife as being of little consequence; to indicate the seriousness of the matter, 
  it was likened to death. Indeed, one should be more cautious about the brother-in-law 
  than about a stranger. The phrase ""the brother-in-law is death"" may 
  have a number of meanings:

That being alone with a brother-in-law 
      may lead to disaster if a sin is committed, or may spell divorce for the 
      woman if her husband cannot contain his jealousy;
Or: Beware of being alone with a non-mahram 
      woman  fear this as you fear death.

All this stems from 
  Islams keenness to protect households, to avoid evil and to preserve marriages 
  in the best possible way. You will find more details under question #217

A woman before becoming Muslim changed her last name from her family name to her husband's. Now that she is Muslim, she is no longer married to that man. Also, she would like to formally change her name to a Muslim name to affirm her Islamic identity. She would like to also change her last name back to her family name, however, she would like to adopt her mother's maiden name (maternal grand-father's name) instead of her father's name, since there is some conflict between them, and that she said he did not have much to do with her upbringing. Is it permissible for her to take her mother's maiden name?",,"Praise be to Allah.This womans desire to take an Islamic name and to change her family name from that of her former husband is quite correct, but it is not permissible for her to call herself after anyone except her legitimate father no matter what the reasons for wishing to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Call them (adopted sons) by the names of their fathers"" [al-Ahzaab 33:5].
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever calls himself by other than his fathers name (or attributes himself to someone other than his father), will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people."" (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104).

      brother in Islam who he thinks is a good person to make du’aa’ for him when he
      is going for Hajj or on some other journey, and asking him to make du’aa’ for
      him in his absence? Because the Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      praised Uways and urged his Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with him) to ask him to make
      du’aa’ for them (the hadeeth of Uways al-Qurani was
      reported by Muslim, no. 2542). Did Shaykh al-Islam
      Ibn Taymiyah regard it as makrooh to do this and say that the hadeeth applied only to
      Uways? Please explain to us.",,"Praise be to Allah.Asking a person to make du’aa’ for you who you
    think will have his du’aa’s answered, either because of his righteousness or
    because he is going to a place where one hopes his du’aa’s will be answered,
    such as travelling or going for Hajj or ‘Umrah, etc., is OK in principle. But if
    there is the fear that something that is not right may result from it, such as the person
    who makes the request relying on the person whom he has asked, or always relying on other
    people with regard to matters in which he should call on his Lord, or there is the fear
    that the person of whom the request is made may become arrogant and think that he has
    reached such a level that people ask him to make du’aa’ for them, then this is
    sufficient reason not to do this, because in this case it leads to something that is not
    right. If it does not lead to something that is not right, then in principle it is
    permissible, but still we say that it should not be done, because it was not the custom of
    the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) to ask one another to make du’aa’
    for one another. The hadeeth in which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) is reported to have said to ‘Umar, “Do not forget us in your
    du’aa’, O my brother” (reported by Abu Dawood, no. 1498, and
    al-Tirmidhi, no. 3557) is a weak hadeeth and there is no proof that the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said this.
    With regard to the fact that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with
    them) asked the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make
    du’aa’ for them, it is well-known that no one else can reach the level of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when ‘Ukaashah ibn Muhsan
    asked him to pray that he would be one of those who would enter Paradise without being
    called to account or being punished, he said, “You will be one of them” (reported
    by al-Bukhaari, no. 6541; Muslim, no. 216, 218, 220), and when another man
    came and asked the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ask Allaah to
    send them rain, he did so (reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1013; Muslim, 897).
    With regard to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    advising his companions to ask Uways al-Qurani to make du’aa’ for them, this
    undoubtedly applied only in his case, and it is known that Uways was not on the same level
    as Abu Bakr or ‘Umar or ‘Uthmaan or ‘Ali, or other Sahaabah. The Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell anyone among his Sahaabah to ask
    anyone to make du’aa’ for them.
To sum up, we can say: there is no sin in asking someone to make
    du’aa’ for you that you hope will have his du’aa’ answered, on the
    condition that this does not involve anything that is wrong, but it is better and more
    appropriate not to do this."
582,1946,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1946,Ruling on making    bets in matters of shar’i knowledge,"Question

Some students of shar’i knowledge make a kind of bet whereby the one who is wrong (on a given issue) has to buy a book, for example, for the one who gets it right. Is this halaal?",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a competition, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) thought that there was nothing wrong with competitions on issue of sharee’ah. He explained this by pointing out that jihaad may be either with knowledge or with weapons. He also used as evidence the reports about Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) when the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) “Alif-Laam-Meem. The Romans have been defeated in the nearer land (Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Palestine), and they, after their defeat, will be victorious, within three to nine years…” [al-Room 30:1-4] was revealed. The Persians were the ones who had defeated the Romans; the Romans were Christians, People of the Book, whilst the Persians were Magians (Zoroastrians), who had no revealed Book. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “… And on that day, the believers (i.e., Muslims) will rejoice (at the victory given by Allaah to the Romans against the Persians).” [al-Room 30:4], because the believers wanted the Christians to defeat the Persians as the Christians were People of the Book and therefore closer to Islam than the Magians. Quraysh, on the other hand, wanted the Magians to defeat the Romans, and said, “The Romans cannot defeat the Persians, because the Persians are stronger than they are, and they do not believe in the Qur’aan.” So Abu Bakr bet them a number of camels that (the Romans) would prevail within seven years. The seven years passed and nothing had happened. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who told him, “Add two years, and increase the bet”
(reported by Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, 10/165, 166, no. 27876) – because the word bid’ used in the aayah refers to any number between three and nine. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to play it safe by increasing the time period and increasing the prize. Abu Bakr did this, and before the two years had passed, travellers brought news that the Romans had defeated the Persians. From this report Shaykh al-Islam deduced that it is permissible to bet in matters of shar’i knowledge."
583,1947,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1947,Ruling on praying alone behind a row in the congregation,"Question

What is the ruling on praying alone behind a row in the congregation? Is this permissible or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.The four imaams – al-Shaafa’i, Malik, Abu Haneefah and Imam Ahmad (according to one opinion narrated from him) – said that the prayer of a person standing alone behind a row is valid, whether the row in front of him is complete or not. They said that the hadeeth “There is no prayer for the one who stands alone behind a row”
(reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 4/23 and by Ibn Maajah, no. 1003, and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Irwa’, no. 514) is like the hadeeth “There is no prayer when there is food prepared” (reported by Muslim, no. 560). The meaning is that the prayer is not proper and complete. But there is a report from Ahmad that the prayer of the person who stands alone behind the row is not valid at all. This is the well-known view in the madhhab of Imaam Ahmad: the prayer of the person who stands alone behind the row is not valid in any circumstances, even if the last row is full.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah took a moderate view, and said: “If the row is full, then the prayer of the one who stands alone behind the row is valid, because in this case he is not able to be a part of the row, and Allah does not burden a person beyond his scope. If the row is not full, then it is not right for him to pray standing alone behind the row, because he has no excuse.” This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam and of our Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him). This is the view that we think is correct, which is that if the row is full, pray standing on your own, and do not pull someone out of the row to join you or go and stand with the imaam in front. This is the correct opinion, which we think is closer to the Sunnah than the opinion that the prayer of the one who stands on his own is absolutely invalid or is unconditionally valid. And Allah knows best. (Liqa’ al-Bab al-maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 226)."

                as-salaam-u-alikumI would like to know why Muslims once prayed towards bait-ul-muqadis and
      why was this changed to the ka'baa.jazakallah",,"Praise be to Allah.When the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came
    from Makkah to Madeenah, he used to face Bayt al-Maqdis when he prayed, and that remained
    the case for sixteen or seventeen months, as is proven in the two Saheehs (al-Bukhaari and
    Muslim), in the hadeeth of al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him
    and his father), who said: The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) prayed towards Bayt al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months, and he was hoping that
    the Qiblah would be towards the House (i.e., the Kabah)
Then after that Allaah commanded him to face the direction of the
    Kabah (the Sacred House), in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
    so turn your face in the direction of al-Masjid al-Haraam (at Makkah). And wheresoever you
    people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction [al-Baqarah
    2:144].
Before we answer the question about the wisdom behind this change, we must
    note the following points:
When we Muslims hear of a command from Allaah, we must accept it and
      submit to it, even if the wisdom behind it is not clear to us, as Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning): It is not for a believer, man or woman, when
      Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter, that they should have any option in their
      decision [al-Ahzaab 33:36]
Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not give any command without
      there being great wisdom behind it  even if we do not understand it  as He
      says (interpretation of the meaning):  That is the judgement of Allaah. He
      judges between you. And Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:10]
Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not abrogate any rule except
      to replace it with something better or similar to it, as He says (interpretation of the
      meaning): Whatever Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We
      bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allaah is able to do all
      things? [al-Baqarah 2:106]
Having understood this, we may note that the wisdom behind the changing of
    the Qiblah has several aspects, including:
It is a test for the true believer, because the true believer, unlike
      others, accepts the commands of Allaah. Allaah has spoken of this in the Quraan
      (interpretation of the meaning):  And We made the Qiblah which you used to
      face, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their
      heels. Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allaah guided
      [al-Baqarah 2:143]
This ummah is the best of nations, as Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning): You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind
      [Aal Imraan 3:110]. Confirming the aayat about the Qiblah, Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning): Thus We have made of you (true Muslims) a Wasat
      (just) (and the best) nation [al-Baqarah 2:143]. Wasat
      conveys meanings of justice and of being chosen. So Allaah has chosen for this ummah
      goodness in all things and the best commands and rules, and thus He chose for them the
      Qiblah of Ibraaheem, upon whom be peace.
Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad (6/134-135) from
    Aaishah that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said
    about the People of the Book (Jews and Christians): They do not envy us for anything
    as much as they envy us for Yawm al-Jumuah (Friday), to which Allaah has
    guided us and from which they have gone astray, and for the Qiblah to which Allaah has
    guided us and from which they have gone astray, and for our saying Aameen
    behind the imaam. (For more information on this subject, please refer to Badai

of such pregnancies end up in miscarriages at a later and 
riskier stage of pregnancies, or still born baby. what is a

knowledgeable islamic scholars each came up with a different 
solution ie one suggesting abortion the other one suggesting 
continuing with pregnancy. The couple had to make a decision 
the soonest possible. what do the laws of islam say?",,"Praise be to Allah.
If the fetus has reached the age of four months, then the soul has already 
been breathed into it, so deliberately aborting it would be regarded as killing 
a soul - which is a very grave major sin. The doctors' opinion that it is 
malformed is no excuse at all. If it is miscarried or stillborn, or it is born 
alive and dies shortly thereafter, the parents will be rewarded for bearing the 
calamity of their loss, and if it lives and has some kind of disability, they 
will be rewarded for their patience in taking care of it. Everything that 
happens to the believer is good for him, but wilfully destroying a soul is 
nothing but evil and sin. We must also take into consideration the errors 
that may occur in doctors' reports, and that fact that the condition of the

Could you please find out if this is true and give me a definite answer? Thank you very much!","Earrings are haram for men as earrings and bracelets are forms of adornment for women. Men are allowed to wear silver rings. Islam allows men to wear gold and silver when necessary to replace a lost tooth or nose, and so on.","Praise be to Allah.Are earnings haram in Islam?
Earrings and bracelets are forms of adornment for women. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who make themselves look like women and women who make themselves look like men . (Al-Bukhari, 5435)
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who wear women’s clothes and women who wear men’s clothes. (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Libas, Bab fi libas al-nisa)

On this basis, it is not permitted for men to wear earrings or nose-rings.
The claim that this is permissible because the people of Quraysh used to do that needs to be proven, in the first place, and where is the proof?
Even if they used to do this in the Jahiliyyah (Time of Ignorance before Islam), Islam came and forbade men to wear the adornment of women or to make themselves look like them, as is clear from the hadiths quoted above. What matters is the ruling of Islam, not what Quraysh or other tribes may have done.
The kinds of female adornment known among Quraysh and others include earrings, bracelets, anklets and bangles worn on the upper arm. The point is that these are known as forms of women’s adornment since ancient times.
Can men wear silver rings?
Islam has given men sufficient scope to adorn themselves by allowing them to wear silver rings . Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wore a ring made of silver, and the people did likewise. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5417)
Islam also allows men to wear gold and silver when necessary to replace a lost tooth or nose, and so on.
The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims
We would say that any Muslim man who wears jewellery is making himself look like the disbeliever , because this is known to be their style of adornment. The latest fashion among them is to wear earrings and the like in their ears, noses , lips, cheeks and other parts of the body (so-called body-piercing ). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Sunan, Kitab al-libas, Bab libas al-shuhrah).
Whoever does this should repent to Allah and not engage in the futile defence of falsehood. He should be distinct in both his personality and his dress from the disbelievers, as Islam has commanded us to be. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

                I was recently told by two sources
  that in the Sunnah there is a reference to fulfilling an Islamic precept that one should
  visit Mecca 7 times in ones life and Jerusalem once.  Could you please help me verify
  this as I have been unable to.
  Thank you very much for your help.",,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever makes any claim about Islamic teachings 
  should produce sound evidence. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Say: ‘Produce your proof 
  if you are truthful.’ ” [al-Baqarah 2:111]
So it is not permitted to accept anyone’s 
  opinion without evidence or proof. What evidence is there that a Muslim should 
  visit Makkah seven times and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) once in his lifetime?!
Allaah has made it a duty to perform Hajj once 
  in a lifetime. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) said: “O people, Allaah has made Hajj a duty upon 
  you, so perform Hajj.” A man asked, “(Should we do it) every year, 
  O Messenger of Allaah?” but he remained silent. The man asked the question 
  three times, then the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I say yes, it will be obligatory for you, 
  and you will not be able to do it.” Then he said: “Do not push me 
  to tell you more than I have told you. Those who came before you were destroyed 
  because they asked too many questions and argued with their Prophets. If I command 
  you to do something, then do as much of it as you can, and if I forbid you to 
  do something, then leave it well alone.” (Reported by Muslim, 
  2380)
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And 
  perform properly (i.e., all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet 
  Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e., the Pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah…” 
  [al-Baqarah 2:196]
The person who performs Hajj and ‘Umrah 
  once in his lifetime does not have to do them again, but it is encouraged to 
  repeat Hajj and ‘Umrah, because the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Follow up one Hajj or 
  ‘Umrah with another, for they eliminate poverty and sins as the fire eliminates 
  dross from iron, gold and silver. An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than 
  Paradise.” (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, al-Sunan, 
  738). The Muslim who is capable and healthy is encouraged not 
  to stay away from the Ancient House (i.e., the Ka’bah) for too long, as 
  Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘If 
  a slave to whom I have given good health and ample provision does not come to 
  visit Me once every five years, he is indeed deprived.’” (Reported 
  by Ibn Hibbaan and others; see Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1909). 
All of the above reports indicate that frequent visits to Makkah 
  are encouraged, but they are not obligatory.
As far as visiting Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) 
  is concerned, if a Muslim never visits it in his lifetime, there is nothing 
  wrong with that. There are no obligatory acts of worship connected with it, 
  but it is the third of the great Mosques which a Muslim is permitted to travel 
  to visit; it is not permitted to travel to any other place for the purpose of 
  prayer and worship, except these three mosques. The Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one should set out 
  on a journey (of pilgrimage) except to three mosques: Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah], 
  the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
  blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem].” (Reported 
  by al-Bukhaari, 1115). The reward for praying in Masjid al-Aqsaa 
  will be multiplied over the reward for praying in any other mosque, apart from 
  Masjid al-Haram in Makkah and Masjid al-Nabi  (peace 
  and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (The Prophet’s Mosque) in Madeenah. 
  The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: “It has been proven that prayer 
  in Masjid al-Aqsaa is worth five-hundred times more than other prayers, as was 
  reported by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr; al-Bazzaar said: its isnaad is hasan.”
 Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
  ‘One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in 
  any other mosque except for al-Masjid al-Haram, and one prayer in al-Masjid 
  al-Haram is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered elsewhere.’” 
  (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3838).

This is a great effort that you have undertaken, and you are to be 
congratulated for the results of your research and your questioning of the 
Muslim girls.
What you need to know are the basic matters which are easy to learn, such 
as the meaning of the Shahaadatayn (the two statements of faith) - which 
are the key to Islam - and the six pillars of faith (eemaan) and the five pillars 
of Islam. You should also learn how to pray so that you can begin to pray 
after you pronounce the Shahaadatayn. You can find a lot of information 
on these matters on this website, in the section on 'aqeedah (correct belief), 
under the headings ""Issues relevant to accepting and embracing Islam"" and 
""Basic tenets of Islam for non-Muslims.""
As regards your mother, we hope that she will not try to stop you 
becoming a Muslim. Treat her with kindness and tell her about Islam in 
beautiful words - maybe she will embrace Islam too. If you are afraid that 
she may turn against you if she knows about your Islam, then you do not 
have to tell her about it. Embrace Islam in secret, and do as much as you 
can of your duties towards Allaah. Allaah will never forsake you; in fact, 
He will help you and support you, if you turn to Him. We ask Allaah to

is not a sin, and does not prevent one from celebrating the waleemah

wedding night is their concern alone, and they know best what will suit their 
own personalities. This is a good opportunity to remind Muslim men and 
women of the importance of verifying whatever they hear, and to warn 
them not to accept Islamic rulings from people who are not qualified to

Dear Brother,
 Please let me know if this is true or not, a lady whom i go to Talim
  Classes with has told me that vegetables grown under ground are makroo, and to cook many
  makrooh things in one pot is Haram.
 We are very used to making stew with more than 5 or 6 vegetables which are
  grown underground all in one pot. Is she telling the truth or is she mistaken.
  Wasalaam,
Sha",,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He it is Who created for you all that 
  is on earth…” [al-Baqarah 2:29]
“O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful 
  and good on the earth…” [al-Baqarah 2:168]

  with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibaat 
  [all kinds of halaal (lawful) things] of food?’…” [al-A’raaf 
  7:32]
From this, we know that everything that grows from 
  the earth is in principle halaal (permitted), and no-one should decree it to 
  be haraam (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked) without sound Islamic evidence 
  (daleel). What evidence is there that things that grow beneath the ground, 
  like potatoes, carrots and onions, etc., are makrooh? What is the strange 
  principle on the basis of which this lady – about whose background we know 
  nothing – states that cooking a number of “makrooh” things 
  in one pot results in haraam food?
If the resulting dish was intoxicating or poisonous, or was 
  cooked with something haraam such as pork, then we would say that it is haraam 
  to eat it. But the cooking of five or six kinds of root vegetables together, 
  as you describe, is something permissible, and there is nothing wrong with it. 
  We advise you not to give any weight to the words of those who have no knowledge.

                There is a Muslim who married a widow who has two children from her first marriage.Which Islamic rights has this man towards the children? Has the man the right to tell or force the children to pray? Is the boy allowed to call him ""daddy""? 

Is there any case he must treat them differently?",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, he should order them to pray, as the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
  “Instruct the child to pray when he reaches the age of seven…” 
  (Reported by Abu Dawood in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-salaat, Baab mataa yu’mar 
  al-sabiyyu bi’l-salaat).
The scholars said: “The child should be taught about tahaarah 
  (purity and cleanliness, i.e., wudoo’ etc) and prayer when he reaches 
  the age of ten years.”
The meaning of discipline or instruction is to smack (lightly when and if necessary), threaten and rebuke. The child’s guardian should teach him about tahaarah 
  and salaat (prayer), and tell the child to do these things, when he reaches the 
  age of seven, and he should discipline him and force him to do them when he 
  reaches the age of ten.
The guiding principle here is the hadeeth (narration)of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him): “Teach the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly)if he does not pray when he is ten.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is a hasan/sound hadeeth).
According to another report, he said: “Tell 
  the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly) if he does not do it when he is ten, and separate them in their beds.” This training is ordained 
  by Islam to teach the prayer and let the child get used to praying, so that 
  he will be accustomed to it and will not forget it when he reaches puberty. 
  There is no difference between boys and girls in this matter of discipline. 
  (See Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, Baab sifat al-salaat).
Some people may not feel comfortable about disciplining orphans, 
  but the right approach is for their guardian to teach them and direct them in 
  whatever way is beneficial, even if this involves being harsh with the child 
  for his own sake. There is nothing wrong with that, as the poet said:
“He was harsh so that they would understand. Let the one 
  who is determined and resolved be harsh sometimes towards those for whom he 
  cares.”
The scholars said: “(A guardian) has the right to (lightly) smack an orphan under his care just as he would (lightly) smack his own child.” 
  (See Al-durr al-mukhtaar: Baab al-ta’zeer).
As regards the matter of an orphan calling his guardian “Father”

What sura in the Quran is related or mentions about the curruption of the Torah and Gospel?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): “Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will belive in your religion in spite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawraat), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?” [al-Baqarah 2:75]
Qutaadah said: “The phrase ‘then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it’ refers to the Jews, who used to hear the words of Allah, then they altered it after they had understood what it meant.”
Abu ‘Aaliyah said: “They took what Allah had revealed in their Book describing Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and changed its meaning.” Ibn Zayd said: “The phrase ‘[they] used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawraat), then they used to change it’ refers to the Tawraat which Allah revealed to them; they changed it, making what it permitted forbidden, and what was forbidden allowed, changing the truth to falsehood and falsehood to truth…” [Tafseer Ibn Katheer]
Allah also said (interpretation of the meaning): “Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: ‘We hear your word (O Muhammad) and disobey,’ and ‘Hear and let you (Muhammad) hear nothing.’ And Raa’ina [in Arabic this means, ‘Be careful, listen to us and we listen to you,’ whereas in Hebrew it means ‘an insult.’] with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). And if only they had said, ‘We hear and obey,’ and ‘Do make us understand,’ it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except for a few.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:46]
The phrase “[they] displace words from (their) right places” means that they misinterpret them and understand them in a way that Allah did not intend, doing this deliberately and inventing lies against Allah. [Tafseer Ibn Katheer]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds). Verily, Allah loves al-Muhsineen (good-doers).” [al-Maa’idah 5:13]
The phrase “because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them” refers to the fact that they broke the Covenant which had been made with them, so Allah cursed them, i.e., He kept them away from following the True Guidance. “[We] made their hearts grow hard” means that they will not benefit from any preaching because their hearts are so hard. “They change the words from their (right) places” means that they play havoc with the words of Allah and misinterpret His Book, taking it to mean things that were never meant and attributing to Allah things that He never said; may Allah protect us from that.
“[They] have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them” means that they stopped following its teachings because they did not want to follow them. Al-Hasan said: “They did not adhere to their religion or keep their duties towards Allah, without which no deeds are acceptable to Him; their fitrah (innate nature) was not sound and their deeds were not righteous.” [Tafseer Ibn Katheer]
So it becomes quite clear that the ways in which the Children of Israel tampered with the Tawraat and Injeel include the following:

Changing
Omitting
Adding things and attributing to Allah words that He did not say
Misinterpreting the words of Allah.

When Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent, the original Tawraat and Injeel had already been altered and distorted. Allah revealed the Qur’aan to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and guaranteed that He Himself would preserve it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]
This distinguishing feature was not found in any Book before the Qur’aan. From the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the present (more than fourteen hundred years) the Qur’aan has stayed the same, and not a single letter of it has been changed, as ancient manuscripts and the hearts of generation after generation of people who have memorized the entire text and earned the title of “haafiz” bear witness. We ask Allah to guide us to the true and straight path.

I need to know whether we as Muslims are allowed to eat the eyes of a fish. I was eating at a seafood restaurant with a friend and I was enjoying the head of the fish and then I ate the eye and he was quite disgusted and said that it is not allowed in Islam. Is that true?","Allah has permitted us all the produce of the sea. So, all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc.","Praise be to Allah.Is seafood halal?
Allah has permitted us all the produce of the sea . Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc.
{Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food} [al-Maidah 2:96 interpretation of the meaning]. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that it is halal (lawful) to eat dead creatures from the sea and dead fish , and no part of the fish was excluded from this permission. 
Can you eat fish eyes?
Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc.
It is strange indeed that a person could dare to forbid something that Allah has permitted. This is a very serious matter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who believe! Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.} [al-Maidah 5:87]
{Say: Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) things] of food? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic law) in detail for people who have knowledge.} [al-A’raf 7:32]
{Say: Tell me, what provision Allah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?} [Yunus 10:59]
Allah has also warned His slave against forbidding anything without knowledge. He said (interpretation of the meaning):
{And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: This is lawful and this is forbidden, so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.} [al-Nahl 16:116]
This person who has invented a lie against Allah by saying that it is haram to eat the eye of a fish must repent to Allah, and not go beyond the limits in talking about the Religion of Allah. He should not speak without knowledge. Even if he is put off by something or feels disgusted by it, he has no right to say that it is haram. 
Disliking certain foods does not mean prohibiting them
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hated the smell of garlic, and said: Whoever eats anything from this unpleasant plant should not approach us in the mosque. The people said, “It has become haram (forbidden), it has become haram.” When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard what was being said, he said: O people, it is not for me to forbid something that Allah has permitted; this is just a vegetable whose smell is unpleasant. (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, 877)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the fact that he disliked garlic and told people not to come to the mosque after eating it did not mean that it was haram.
Although the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked the idea of eating lizard-meat, he did not forbid others to eat it, as is reported in the following story:
Khalid ibn al-Walid reported that some grilled lizard meat was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and put in front of him. He stretched out his hand to take some, but one of the people present said, O Messenger of Allah, it is lizard meat, so he pulled his hand back. Khalid ibn al-Walid asked, O Messenger of Allah, is lizard haram? He said, No, but it is not known among my people and I cannot face eating it. So Khalid took some of the lizard meat and ate it, whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked on. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4981, al-Nasai, 4242, and Abu Dawud, 3300)
After explaining this answer to you, I want to warn you about something that I noticed in your question, where you said that you went to the seafood restaurant with a male friend. If this person is not your husband or a mahram (blood-relative whom you are permanently forbidden to marry), then you should fear Allah. Ask yourself: which is more serious, eating the eye of a fish or going out with a man to whom you are not related to sit and chat with him in a restaurant?
I ask Allah to protect us from all things that earn His wrath and to help us remember and fear Him. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

If a wife does not allow her husband to have intercourse, should he divorce her or should he marry a second wife?","The answer may be found in a hadith narrated by Muslim: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the heavens [i.e. Allah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with her.”","Praise be to Allah.If a woman refuses her husband’s request to come to bed with no Islamically-sound reason (such as sickness, or his being drunk, for example), what happens is as described below:
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4794; the additional phrase quoted in square brackets is from Abu Dawud, al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikaah, Bab haqq al-zawj ‘ala’l-mar-ah).
In the phrase “if a man calls his wife to his bed,” the word “bed” is obviously a metaphor for intercourse. Metaphors are used in the Quran and Sunnah to refer to things about which people usually feel shy.
Does this apply only to the nighttime, or does it include the daytime too? The answer may be found in a hadith narrated by Muslim: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the heavens [i.e. Allah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with her.” 
Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban report a hadith narrated by Jabir: “There are three whose prayers will not be accepted and none of whose good deeds will ascend to heaven: a runaway slave, until he returns to his master; a drunken man until he becomes sober; and a woman with whom her husband is angry, until he is pleased with her.” These are general terms, which include both night and day.
The phrase “and he spends the night angry with her” refers to the cause of the angels’ curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the matter drop. 
Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it, and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. But if he is the one who started it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame. In one report, instead of the words “the angels curse her until morning,” the wording is “… until she returns” – and this is a useful variant.
This hadith tells us that denying a spouse’s rights – whether physical or financial – is something that will inevitably bring about the wrath of Allah, unless Allah grants His mercy to the sinner.
We also learn that the angels will pray against a sinner so long as he or she persists in the sin.
The hadith also directs a wife to help her husband and seek his satisfaction, because a man is less patient than a woman when it comes to doing without intercourse. The most disturbing thing for a man is his sexual impulse, so Islam urges women to help their husbands in this regard. (Adapted and abbreviated from the commentary by al-Hafiz Ibn Hijr – may Allah have mercy on him – on this hadith in Fath al-Bari).
Whether the husband wants to discipline his wife, or forgive her, or take another wife, or divorce her, this is all up to him to choose. Let the woman beware of incurring her husband’s wrath because this will lead to Allah’s being angry with her.
We ask Allah to rectify this situation. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

  not cancelled by a lack of love between the spouses or by whatever disputes 
  and differences there may be between them. It can only be cancelled if her husband 
  divorces her or the marriage is annulled. Both partners should fear Allaah, 
  and the husband should treat his wife decently. If he dislikes her, he should 
  either keep her and treat her decently, or let her go in a proper manner. The

It is OK for you to marry a second wife, and in fact this could be the solution to your problem, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""… then marry women of your choice, two or three, or four…"" [al-Nisaa’ 4:3]

    these Muslim students in your city, who are in the greatest need of learning about their
    religion in a land of kufr. Perhaps your background of having lived in Saudi Arabia will
    help you with this. I advise you to concentrate on teaching them about Tawheed and correct
    Islamic ‘aqeedah (belief), explaining how to do acts of worship from a Fiqh point of
    view, and teaching them the biographies of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) and his Companions.
As for the matter which you raised in your question, letting boys and
    girls sit together facing one another in one halaqah is not free from dangers, as you
    know. I think that you feel the same way, which is what made you ask this question,
    especially when we expect that the hijaab of the girls where you live is incomplete and
    that the faces of some of them, at least, are uncovered in front of the boys. For this
    reason I suggest one of two things: either get the girls to sit behind the boys, wearing
    full hijaab, so that you don’t feel embarrassed when you face the group to give a
    lesson; or put up a barrier or screen between the boys and girls, such that they can still
    hear your voice, if the girls do not want to wear full hijaab. Then they can ask questions
    from behind the screen, so long as they are not soft in speech, or they can write
    questions on pieces of paper.
May Allaah help us and you to do good and to call people to His way and
    earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

    atheist does not differentiate between a Prophet and an astrologer","Question

                A disbeliever regards Prophet Muhammad
      (sal) as a great scholar, a great person but not approving him as the prophet of God.If we mentions the prophecy made by Muhammad (sal) and in the Quran, he
      compares it with the prophecy made by some other persons like Nostradamus. How to clarify
      him?",,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that your friend, in his ignorance of the true nature 
  of Prophethood, does not make a distinction between a Prophet and an astrologer, 
  and so he compares the Prophethood of Muhammad  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the astrology of the French 
  physicist Nostradamus who lived in the 16th century CE and composed 
  books of fantasies and illusions. His books are written in ambiguous language 
  about events that will happen up until the end of the world, which he expected 
  would happen in the year 3797. A person like this needs to understand the true 
  nature of Prophethood and why mankind needs to believe in it, and he needs to 
  know that the Unseen can only be known through the Prophets who were chosen 
  by Allaah. He needs to know that Prophethood is a gift from Allaah, may He be 
  glorified, and it cannot be attained by a person’s desires or own efforts. 
  Prophethood is a pure blessing from Allaah, as is indicated in His words (interpretation 
  of the meanings):
“Those were they unto whom Allaah bestowed His Grace from 
  along the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in 
  the ship) with Nooh…” [Maryam 19:58]
“Thus will your Lord choose you…” [Yoosuf 12:6]
“… I have chosen you above men by My Messages and by 
  My speaking (to you)…” [al-A’raaf 7:144]
“… Allaah knows best with whom to place His Message…” 
  [al-An’aam 6:124]
Then he should realize that the way in which Allaah conveys His 
  message to His Prophets and Messengers is by wahy (revelation). Allaah 
  says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have inspired you 
  (O Muhammad) as We inspired Nooh and the Prophets after him…” [al-Nisa’ 
  4:163]. There is nothing wrong with explaining to him the three types or 
  levels of wahy so that he may have a better understanding of this channel of 
  communication between Allaah and His creation, which is so essential for mankind. 
  These three types or levels have been mentioned by Allaah in the Qur’aan 
  (interpretation of the meaning): “It is not given to any human being 
  that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be) by Inspiration, or from behind 
  a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave. 
  Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” [al-Shooraa 42:51]
These three types or levels may be further explained as follows:

Inspiring something in the heart of a Prophet in such a way 
      that he has no doubt about it and is certain that it is from Allaah. It 
      was reported in a hadeeth that the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The holy spirit 
      (i.e., Jibreel) blew into my heart that no soul dies until its provision 
      (rizq) and appointed time have expired, so fear Allaah and be polite 
      and reasonable when you seek to earn a living from others.” (Reported 
      by Ibn Hibbaan). This type of revelation also includes the visions of the 
      Prophets, which are true, as is proven in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah 
      Umm al-Mu’mineen (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “The 
      first thing that happened to the Messenger of Allaah  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of wahy was true vision in his 
      dreams: he did not see something but it would become as true as daybreak.” 
      (Agreed upon).

Therefore the Prophet and Friend of Allaah, Ibraaheem, hastened 
    to sacrifice his son when he saw that he was commanded to do so in a dream. 
    He took this dream as being a revelation to him, as Allaah tells us (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.
And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he 
    said, ‘O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering 
    you in sacrifice to Allaah), so look what you think!’ He said: ‘O 
    my father! Do that which you are commanded, in sha Allaah (if Allaah will) 
    you will find me of al-saabireen (the patient ones).’
Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will 
    of Allaah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side 
    of his forehead, for slaughtering),
And We called out to him: ‘O Ibraaheem!
You have fulfilled the dream (vision)! Verily, thus do We reward 
    the muhsinoon (good-doers).
Verily, that was a manifest trial,
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (a ram).” [al-Saaffaat 
    37:101-107]
Speaking to His Messengers from behind a barrier. Allaah spoke 
      thus to Moosa, upon whom be peace, as He says (interpretation of the meanings): 
    
“And when Moosa came at the time and place appointed by 
    Us, and his Lord spoke to him…” [al-A’raaf 7:143]
“And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name, 
    ‘O Moosa!
Verily, I am your Lord! So take off your shoes, you are in 
    the sacred valley, Tuwa.
And I have chosen you. So listen to that which is inspired to 
    you.
Verily, I am Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped but 
    I, so worship Me, and perform al-salaat (prayer) for My Remembrance.’”[Ta-Ha 
    20:12-14]
Revelation to a Prophet via an angel. This is what Allaah 
      refers to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… 
      or He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave…” 
      [al-Shoora 42:51]. This messenger is Jibreel, upon whom be peace.
The angel came to the Prophet in three forms as is proven 
      in the shar’i texts. These three forms are:

The Messenger  (peace and blessings 
        of Allaah be upon him) saw him in the form in which Allaah created him. 
        This happened to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
        of Allaah be upon him) twice.


The revelation came with a noise like the sound of a bell, 
        which went away after the Prophet  (peace 
        and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had understood what he had said.


The angel appeared in the form of a man and spoke to him, 
        and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
        be upon him) understood what he said. This was the easiest of the three 
        ways for the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
        of Allaah be upon him). This what happened the first time Jibreel came 
        to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
        be upon him) in the Cave of Hira’.

Then you should tell your friend something of the evidence 
  of the Prophethood of Muhammad  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) and his miracles (see Question # 2114), 
  the chief of which is the Qur’aan. There is no harm in giving him a copy 
  of the translation of its meanings. If he believes, then praise be to Allaah, 
  and if he remains a disbeliever after this, then he will bear the consequences 
  of his kufr and will be one of the losers, so do not worry about him, for Allaah 
  is independent of all creatures."

                As-salam wai lai kum,
 When helping brothers/sisters to find
      suitable Muslim partners, what questions can be asked, and what is forbidden to ask ?
     Can one ask about their past when they were
      non-Muslim or not practicing Muslims ?
  Can one ask ones wife/sister to describe in
      detail the appearance of an intended wife or describe in detail to them regarding a
      brother ?
     Was Salam",,"Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then
    you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment
    situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any
    preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most
    important characteristic to ask about is a person’s level of commitment to Islam.
    This kind of useful question is fine.
But asking for details of a person’s past and wanting to know what
    sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam – this is not
    right at all. Allaah covers people’s sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not
    dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped
    out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only
    embarrass people? Allaah accepts people’s repentance without their having to confess
    or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery
    and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they
    entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful
    past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What
    matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous
    or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly
    living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any
    fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on,
    then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest.
As far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone
    is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood
    relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write
    down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously
    considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see
    her.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839)
    The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a
    husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the
    other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong. (Commentary on the above
    hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).
    We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which He loves and
    will earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

The Prophet, Peace and blessings be upon him said, “Report from me even if a verse.

Those people are apt to falling into dangerous abyss: preventing what Allah has permitted and imposing what He has not imposed.

‘I do not know of any difference of opinion about the Sunnah that a woman should stand behind the man or men, if there is another man besides the imaam, or behind the imaam if she is alone. This is known from the hadeeth of Anas which was reported by al-Bukhaari, in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led him and his mother and maternal aunt in prayer: “He made me stand on his right, and made the woman stand behind us.” This was also reported by Maalik, according to whom he said: “I and the orphan stood behind him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the old woman stood behind us.”’
Elsewhere he said: ‘There is no difference of opinion regarding the fact that a woman on her own should pray behind the imaam, and that if there is another man present, he should stand beside the imaam and the woman should stand behind him.”

I would like to know about the status of Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him",,"Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed for everyone who hears the adhaan and call to prayer to repeat after the muezzin (caller to prayer), and when he has finished repeating the entire adhaan, he should send prayers and blessings on the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then recite the words narrated in the saheeh hadeeth (authentic prophetic narration) from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah, who reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer, ‘Allahummah Rabba haadhihi’l-da’wat il-taammah wa’l-salaat il-qaa’imah, aati Muhammadan al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah, wab’athhu maqaaman mahmoodan alladhi wa’adtahu (O Allah, Lord of this perfect Call and the Prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege and also the eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that You have promised), will be granted my intercession on the Day of Resurrection.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 579). There is no phrase in this du’aa’ like “al-darajah al-‘aaliyah al-rafee’ah (the high and elevated status),” so this should not be said. The conjunction “wa” in the phrase “al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah (the privilege and also the eminence) is by way of explanation; waseelah is the status higher than the rest of creation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained it in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin and say something like he says, then send blessings on me, whoever sends blessings on me, Allah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of the slaves of Allah will reach, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me will be granted intercession.” (Reported by Muslim, 577).
The “praised position”(maqaam mahmood) is intercession before Allah so that He will start to judge between His slaves, and no one will be granted this except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is mentioned in the words of Allah addressed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):
“Perform al-salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e., the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e., the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night).
And in some parts of the night (also) offer the salaah (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur’aan in the prayer), as an additional prayer (tahajjud – optional prayer) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to maqaaman mahmoodah (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the highest degree in Paradise).” [al-Isra’ 17:78-79]
It is called al-maqaam al-mahmood because all of creation will praise Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for that status, because his intercession will ease their distress on that terrible day by setting the process of judgement in motion. And Allah knows best."
611,2037,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2037,Is Silk Haram for Men?,"Question

I know that men should not wear silk garments, but if a garment is made of party silk but is not silky, soft, shiny, and feminine looking and looks like wool (suit coat), then would it be OK?",It is haram for Muslim men to wear pure silk but it is permissible for Muslim women to wear pure silk.,"Praise be to Allah.Can men wear silk?
The scholars agreed that it is permissible for women to wear and use pure silk , and that it is haram for men to do so. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, held them aloft and said: “These are haram for the males of my ummah and permitted for the females.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 2/1189)
Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold and silk have been permitted for the females of my ummah and forbidden for the males.”
Indeed, a stern warning has been narrated concerning this matter, as was reported by al-Bukhari (5853) and Muslim (2069) in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Silk is only worn in this world by the one who will have no share of the pleasure of the Hereafter.” 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears silk in this world will not wear it in the Hereafter.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5832)
When can men wear silk?
The scholars allowed men to wear silk in certain exceptional circumstances where there is Shar’i evidence to support this, such as Muslim combatants in war who are allowed to wear silk in order to show off and annoy the enemy, which is a kind of psychological warfare. 
People who are sick may also be permitted to wear silk to relieve their suffering, as Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf and Ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) to wear silk because of a skin irritation that they suffered from. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 10/295, and Muslim, 3/1646)
The scholars also allowed men to wear garments containing four fingers’ width of silk, because of the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the wearing of silk except for an area the width of two fingers, or three or four.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/1644)
With regard to the matters mentioned in the question, the issue is not what a thing is called but what it really is. If the item that a man is going to wear is made of natural silk, then it is not permissible for him to wear it, no matter how it looks or feels, and no matter whether it is a shirt, pants, socks, a necktie or anything else. 
And Allah knows best."
612,2038,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2038,Mankind’s    need for Prophethood,"Question

what is the importance of prorhecy for the humanety? Why is faith in Prophethood so important?",,"Praise be to Allah.Mankind is in need of Messengers and Prophets from Allah, to light the way and guide them to ways of peace, and to warn them against the ways of evil and corruption. Some of the things for which mankind clearly needs Messengers and Prophets are:

1 - Guidance to Allah, may He be exalted and glorified
Mankind has gone through periods where they did not have Messengers and Messages from Allah for a long time, and so they fell into the traps of illusions and myths, so they prayed to natural phenomena and heavenly bodies, or idols that could neither benefit nor harm them, worshipping them in fear and hope. At the same time, they were subjected to humiliation by those who claimed divinity, such as the Pharaohs and others. Even though there was never a time when at least a few people wondered about Who had sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and instinctively realized that there was a Creator, they still failed to worship Him properly and heed His commands and prohibitions and understand what He wanted them to do and not do, because they had no contact with anybody who could tell that about all that. The wisdom of Allah dictated that He should save the confused and misguided by blessing them with the knowledge of His Divine qualities and Beautiful Names, so He honoured them and all of humanity by sending Messengers who would guide them towards the Creator, as He tells us in the story of Nooh (peace be upon him): ""Indeed, We sent Nooh to his people and he said, 'O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other ilaah (god) but Him. Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day!'"" [Al-A'raaf 7:59]. All the Prophets and Messengers, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them, came one after the other, bringing the same Message.

2 - Guidance regarding the Hereafter
One of the reasons why Prophets and Messengers were sent was to tell people about the Hereafter, because if man does not believe in Allah and the Last Day, he will be a slave to his desires, running after material things and following the ways of misguidance. If he is reminded or advised, he will deny that he is answerable for his deeds. Allah has described such people in His words (interpretation of the meaning): ""And they say, 'There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except al-dahr (the time).' And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture."" [Al-Jaathiyah 45:24].

So it was the task of the Prophets and Messengers to establish proof of the Last Day, and to explain that the One Who created mankind from nothing is able to bring them back to life after their death, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Say: 'Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most of mankind know not."" [al-Jaathiyah 45:26]. On that Day, the scales of justice will be set up and scores between oppressors and their victims will be settled. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And Sufficient are We as Reckoners."" [Al-Anbiya' 21:47]. If it were not for this Reckoning, which we know about only through Prophethood, life would be pointless and a means only for wrongdoing - and this is contrary to the wisdom of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.

3 - Meeting man's need for religion
So long as man remains sound of nature, clear of mind and pure of heart, his need for religion remains a part of him, and he understands that there has to be an Almighty Creator who created and organized the universe in the best way. Thus there emerges from the depths of his being the urge to submit himself fully to the Creator, to seek His help at times of calamity and distress, and to humble himself before Him, as he feels his great need for Him both at times of ease and of hardship. This is referred to in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): ""So set your face towards the religion of pure Islamic monotheism haneefa (worship none but Allah Alone), Allah's fitrah (pattern) with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in khalq-illah [i.e., the Religion of Allah], that is the straight religion, but most of men know not."" [Al-Room 30:30]

According to a hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ""Every new-born baby is born according to the fitrah, then his parents make him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian)"" (Agreed upon). How could a man know how to become religious and worship his Creator without Revelation from Allah to tell him about it? There has to be a mediator between Allah and His creation so that mankind can know about the religion which the Creator wants them to follow; this is the role of the Prophets.

4 - Guidance regarding proper ways of dealing with one another
It is well known that man is by nature sociable, and that he has wishes and desires that cannot be achieved except in cooperation with his fellow-man. So it is clear that mankind urgently needs guidance to regulate his relationships with others, to outline the right way of behaving, to resolve disputes and conflicts, to guard against wrong-doing and oppression, and to protect people's rights - lest some people oppress others. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scriptures and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice"" [Al-Hadeed 57:24].

5 - Guidance towards sound morals
It is also a part of man's nature that he will strive to fulfil his needs even if he does so by means of oppression and domination. So he urgently needs a deterrent, in the form of belief in Allah and the Last Day, to motivate him to acquire good qualities and praiseworthy morals. These can only be known through the divine laws brought and conveyed by the Prophets and Messengers of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them.

6 - Achieving justice in accordance with the will of Allah
It is well known that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is Fair and Just. He rewards the one who does good as a blessing and favour from Him, and He punishes the one who does wrong as an act of justice on His part.

Allah, by His wisdom and mercy, sent His Messengers, from Aadam to Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all) to establish proof (so that people would have no excuse). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
""And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this (i.e., Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Qur'aan), they would surely have said, 'Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger, we should certainly have followed Your aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), before we were humiliated and disgraced.'"" [Ta-Ha 20:134]
""Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers"" [Al-Nisa' 4:165]

Allah, Who is the Most Just of judges, has decreed that He will not punish a nation until He has sent a Messenger to them, as He says: ""Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)."" [Al-Isra' 17:15]

The above should explain the extent of mankind's need for Messengers and their Messages, and why their happiness in this world and the next is connected to that.

And Allah knows best."
613,2039,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2039,Regarding the number 13 as unlucky,"Question

There are some Muslims that claim certain numbers have a special meaning. Some people including unbelievers and Muslims say that the number 13 is a bad or evil number, and some Muslims have found reasons to believe this too. One Muslim said that the Jews captured Jerusalem from Muslims on Friday the 13 and the general who captured it used 13 armies, thus the number is cursed. Is all this just superstition and omen searching which has no place in Islam?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted for the Muslim who believes in Allah as his Lord, Islam as his religion, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as a Prophet and Messenger, and in the divine decree, both good and bad, to think that any being, entity or quality can have a specific effect in bringing good or warding off harm, as there is no evidence in shareeah to that effect. This is part of the legacy of jaahiliyyah (ignorance) which has been cancelled out by Islam and is regarded as being shirk which negates perfect Tawheed, because it is insinuating thoughts (waswaas) and scare tactics from the Shaytaan.
It is like the attitude of the people of Pharaoh, about whom Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): But whenever good came to them, they said, Ours is this. And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moosa and those with him [al-Araaf 7:131]. If some disaster or drought befell them, they blamed it on evil omens which they associated with Moosa and the believers with him, but Allah refuted this and said (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, their evil omens are with Allah [al-Araaf 7:131].
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: Their evil omens means what He decreed for them; they were the cause of what happened to them because of their kufr and rejection of the signs and messengers of Allah.
Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he forbade pessimism and superstitious belief in evil omens. The word tatayyur (pessimism) is derived from teer (birds), because some birds were viewed as evil omens, then the word came to be applied to everything that is taken as a bad sign. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, No adwaa
[transmission of infectious diease without the permission of Allah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], no haamah [refers to a Jaahili Arab tradition described variously as: a worm that infests the grave of a murder victim until he is avenged; an owl; or the bones of a dead person turned into a bird that could fly], and no Safar [the month of Safar was regarded as unlucky in the Jaahiliyyah]. [Translators notes in square brackets]. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5757, and Muslim, 2220.] Muslim added in one of his reports: And no naw (star promising rain) and no ghool (evil demon living in the desert).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) denounced adwaa, the Jaahili belief that attributed sickness to something other than Allah and said that the sickness could transmit itself without the decree of Allah. He explained that all of that happens by the decree of Allah, and that people are instructed to avoid the causes of disaster if they are in good health.
The words no Safar, according to one of the interpretations given by the scholars, refer to the month of Safar, which the people of the Jaahiliyyah viewed with pessimism as being unlucky, as was reported in Sunan Abi Dawood (3914) from Muhammad ibn Raashid from someone who heard him say: The people of the Jaahiliyyah used to regard Safar as inauspicious, and said that it was an unlucky month. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refuted that.
Imaam Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding Safar as inauspicious is a kind of superstition that is forbidden. Also forbidden is regarding particular days, such as Wednesdays, as inauspicious, or following the Jaahili custom of regarding Shawwaal as inauspicious for weddings.
No doubt this also includes the superstitions about the number 13 mentioned in the question. There is no indication in the Quraan or Sunnah that this number should be regarded as inauspicious in any way. The thirteenth is just an ordinary day, like any other day, and anything that happens on such a day happens by divine decree; Allah decreed that it should happen on that day in that way. If a person tried to spend his time counting the numbers of days or dates on which calamities befell the Muslim ummah, he might find some patterns in some instances, but this has nothing to do with bad luck because of certain numbers or dates on which those events happened.
The remedy for this kind of waswaas is for a person to strengthen his heart, have certain faith (yaqeen) in Allah and put his trust in Him. He should know that no disaster happens except by the decree of Allah, and he should beware of getting carried away with this waswaas from the Shaytaan or these ideas that may cross his mind. He may be punished with the very thing that he is fearing, because he is turning away from having faith in Allah and the belief that all good is in His hands, and that He Alone is the one who wards off harm by His power and grace.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us the kafaarah (expiation) to be offered by the one who indulges in any kind of superstitious pessimism. Abd-Allah ibn Amr reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever lets tiyarah (superstition) stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk. They said, What is the kafaarah (expiation) for that? He said, To say: Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You). And Allah knows best.
As this issue is widespread among people nowadays, there is no harm in going into further detail, as follows:
In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
Tiyarah and Fal (Bad omens and good omens)
[1] Tiyarah (seeing bad omens) comes from the word tayr (birds) [because the ancient Arabs used to see omens in the movements of birds and other creatures Translator], and is the opposite of fal (good omens). The Arabs all used to have the same ideas about fal and tiyarah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of and encouraged the idea of seeing good omens, but he disapproved and forbade the idea of seeing bad omens.
[2] Al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam said: The difference between al-tiyarah and al-tatayyur is that tatayyur means feeling in one's heart that something bad is going to happen, whilst tiyarah means acting on the basis of those pessimistic feelings.
[3] Tiyarah existed long before Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): But whenever good came to them, they said, Ours is this. And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moosa and those with him [al-Araaf 7:131].
[4] Types of superstitious belief in bad omens, ancient and modern:




Certain days or months, such as Safar and Shawwaal.


Certain birds, such as crows and owls.


Certain animals, such as snakes, black cats and monkeys, or their movements, such as the passing of gazelles.


Certain types of people, such as a one-eyed man or a hunchback.


Certain numbers, such as 13 among the Christians, 7 among the Bedouin and 10 among the Raafidis; in the latter case because they dislike the asharah mubashsharah (the ten Sahaabah who were given the certain promise of Paradise) with the exception of Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). Hence they will say Nine plus one instead of ten.


Certain sounds, such as the voice of a crow or the sound of an ambulance or fire truck.


Frightening or disturbing dreams.


Colours, such as the colour of blood, or yellow.


When the eyelashes of the left eye tremble involuntarily, they say, Something bad is going to happen to us.


Calling a child by the name of a living person, such as the father or mother and so on.


Witnessing an accident or a fire in the morning.


Seeing ones wifes mother in the morning.


When the right hand or right foot itches.




[5] The virtue of tawakkul (putting ones trust in Allah) and not indulging in tiyarah. The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Seventy thousand people will enter Paradise without being called to account and without being punished. Among the virtues of these people, he described them as not believing in tiyarah and as putting their trust in Allah. (Reported by Muslim).
[6] Condemnation of tiyarah and explanation that it is a kind of shirk. Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Al-tiyarah is shirk, and he said it three times. (Reported by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani).
Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: He is not one of us who does tiyarah or has it done for himself Al-Albaani said: Its isnaad is hasan. Ibn al-Qayyim said: Tiyarah is a kind of shirk and a way in which the Shaytaan influences and scares a person. It is very serious for the one who takes it to heart and pays too much attention to it, but it is insignificant for the one who pays no attention to it and is not concerned about it.
[7] Negation of tiyarah and superstition. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There is no adwaa (contagion) or tiyarah, but I like righteous fal.
(Muslim). And he said, No adwaa, no tiyarah, no haamah, and no Safar. (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
Muaawiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Salami reported that he said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Some of us believe in tiyarah. He said, That is something that any of you may feel in himself, but it should not stop you from doing anything.
(Muslim).
So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that any anxiety suffered because of tiyarah is all in the mind and has nothing to do with the object that caused the fear. It is the persons own illusion, fear and shirk that is affecting him and stopping him from doing what he wants to do, not the thing that he saw or heard. Whoever adheres firmly to the bonds of Tawheed and puts all his trust in Allah, thus nipping the ideas of tiyarah in the bud before they take hold, will be successful and happy in this world and the next.
In a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Leave any ideas of tiyarah as they are [i.e., do not take them any further].
(Saheeh Abi Dawood). What this hadeeth means is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted them not to pay attention to such ideas, but to leave them alone, as Allah had made them, because they can bring neither benefit nor harm.
Ibn Jareer said: What this means is to leave birds (tayr) alone without shooing them away, and carry on with one's own business, because shooing them away does not bring any benefit or ward off any harm.
Ikrimah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We were sitting with Ibn Abbaas when a bird flew over us and screeched. A man who was there said, Good! Ibn Abbaas said to him, It is neither good nor bad. He hastened to rebuke him lest he think that it had any influence for good or evil.
Taawoos set out on a journey with one of his friends, and a crow screeched. The man said, Good! Taawoos said, What is the good in that? Do not accompany me any further.
Ibn Abd al-Hakam said: Muzaahim said, When Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez set out from Madeenah, I looked and saw that the moon was in Hyades [a group of stars in Taurus], and I did not want to tell him that, so I just said to him, Look how beautiful the moon looks tonight. Umar looked, and saw that the moon was in Hyades, and said, It is as if you wanted to tell me that the moon was in Hyades. O Muzaahim, we do not go out by the help of the sun or the moon; we go out by the help of Allah, al-Waahid, al-Qahhaar.
[8] The limits of tiyarah. The kind of tiyarah that makes a person go ahead with his plans or stops him from going ahead is the kind of tiyarah that is prohibited. As for the good omens (fal) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked, this is a kind of optimism that a person does not feel dependent upon, unlike things that may make a person either go ahead or change his plans, in which a person is in a sense depending upon it. And Allah knows best.
[9] Kafaarah (expiation) for one who engages in tiyarah. Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad and Ibn al-Sunni also reported with a saheeh isnaad from Abd-Allah ibn Amr that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever lets tiyarah stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk. They said, What is the kafaarah for that? He said, To say: Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You).
no birds except Yours means: the birds are part of Your creation, they can bring neither benefit nor harm, and the only One Who can bring benefit or harm is You, may You be glorified.
[10] Remedies for tatayyur:
(a) tawakkul, which means delegating all ones affairs to Allah and relying on Him, whilst at the same time taking the necessary means and precautions. This is an obligation which must be done purely and sincerely for Allah, because it is one of the best forms of worship and highest levels of Tawheed. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): and put your trust in Allah, if you are believers indeed. [al-Maaidah 5:23] and And put yout trust in the Ever-Living One Who dies not, and glorify His Praises, and Sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His slaves. [al-Furqaan 25:58]. Putting ones trust in Allah is one of the greatest and most important ways of getting rid of pessimism and superstition and other matters pertaining to shirk.
(b) Knowing that everything that happens, happens by the decree of Allah. Blessings and calamities alike are covered by the will and decree of Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (al-lawh al-mahfooz), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah. [al-Hadeed 57:22]. Thus a person may be reassured about these matters, and there is no need for tatayyur or tiyarah, because good and bad alike are subject to the will and decree of Allah.
(c)   Istikhaarah. This is one of the greatest forms of worship and is complete tawakkul or dependence on Allah. It is the alternative to tatayyur and tiyarah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make istikhaarah for all their affairs just as he used to teach them the soorahs of the Quraan.
(d)   Moving away from places which one thinks are unlucky. Here we are talking about doubt, not certainty. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man said, O Messenger of Allah, we lived in a house where our number was great and our wealth was abundant, then we moved to a house where our numbers dwindled and our wealth decreased. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Leave it, for it is bad. (Reported by Maalik, Abu Dawood, al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad, and classed as hasan by al-Albaani).
Leave it, for it is bad Ibn Abd al-Barr said: I think that he said it lest they adhere to thoughts of tiyarah. Al-Baghawi said: He told them to move away from it because they did not like it and did not feel comfortable; if they moved, the things they were feeling would go away. He did not tell them to move because the house was the cause of the problems.
But the Creator made that the time for His decree to be carried out. suggested by Ibn al-Arabi al-Maaliki.
(e)   Fal (good omen). This is the opposite of tiyarah, for example when a man who is sick hears another addressing him as Ya saalim (O healthy one)!. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There is no adwaa (contagion) and no tiyarah, but I like righteous fal, a good word. (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
The difference between fal and tiyarah is that fal involves thinking in positive terms about Allah, whereas tiyarah involves the opposite, so for this reason it is disliked.
There is another issue here: if a person puts his trust in Allah and goes ahead with his plans, then disaster strikes and harm befalls him, how can this happen when he thought of Allah in positive terms? Our answer is that this is a test, not an omen or tiyarah; the believer is tested in accordance with the level of his faith.
Haafiz al-Hakami said: One of the conditions of fal is that it is not something that a person relies on or tries to figure out; it is just a coincidence that happens to a person without him thinking about it. It is a particularly loathsome form of bidah to try to find fal in the Quraan [by opening it at random]. The one who takes the Verses of Allah as a joke or idle entertainment is surely doing wrong. If a person tries to figure out fal and use it to get good luck, this is tiyarah, like using arrows to seek luck or a decision.
O Allah, we seek refuge with You from associating anything knowingly with You, and we seek Your forgiveness for that which we do unknowingly.

Polygamy...I understand what Allah (swt)has said regarding this subject in as much as the economic and importance of the family structure however where in the Quaran does it address the distressed feelings of a woman when her husband decides to take another wife, and how these two should live in harmony under one roof?",,"Praise be to Allah.The first wife’s distress when her husband marries another wife is to be expected, and Allah has set out rules and regulations to reduce these feelings or remove them altogether, by enjoining justice, patience in the face of adversity, and so on. Whatever the case, the fact that these feelings of distress and the dislike of polygamy exist does not justify condemnation of polygamy. Islam came to serve and increase people’s best interests, and to reduce harmful things and render them ineffective. There is no doubt that polygamy, when practised properly in accordance with Islam, achieves many things that are in people’s best interests (such as maintaining the chastity of the man who is not satisfied with one wife, taking care of and maintaining the chastity of the woman who has no husband, increasing the offspring of the Muslims, solving the problem of widows and spinsters, and of the reduced numbers of men after times of war, and so on). As regards the bad things that happen in cases of polygamy, either they are very small when compared to its benefits, or they stem from bad application of this practice. One of the rights which Islam gives to women is that a wife should have her own house, so the two wives do not have to live together under one roof.

Allah tells us in the Qur'an not to cut off our blood relations. What is the interpretation of the Ayah that commands us not to severe ties of kinship ? Who does it refer to ? Just parents and siblings ? What if one maintains contact with one's parents only through telephone or letters although he is capable of visiting them. Yet, he feels that maintaining a certain distance is healthier to the relationship ?",,"Praise be to Allah.and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.
It is a duty on man to be kind to his parents, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): be good and dutiful to your parents [al-Anaam 6:151]; to show gratitude to them in all kinds of ways, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): give thanks to Me and to your parents [Luqmaan 31:14]; and to show them all kinds of good treatment, because of the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to treat them kindly. The ways in which one can show them kindness and respect are many, e.g., visiting them, speaking kindly to them, lowering to them the wing of humility, giving them gifts, and so on. When you go to visit them with the hope of earning reward from Allah, this is a great form of worship. A son should not neglect this type of worship, and he should appreciate the joy that his parents feel when they see their son and spend time with him. He should not let his work keep him away from seeing his parents, because it is very important and precious for them to see their son. If a person is aware of some negative things when he visits them, he can reduce these negative aspects, or cut the visit short and make up for it in other ways, such as sending letters, making telephone calls or others ways of keeping in touch and maintaining ties, like giving gifts, and so on.
We ask Allah to help us to honour our parents. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
617,2063,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2063,Is Sleeping after Fajr Haram?,"Question

I would like to know if there is any verdict concerning sleeping after Fajr prayer.","There is no text in the Quran or the Sunnah to indicate that sleeping after praying Fajr is prohibited. So the general principle applies (i.e., everything is permitted except that which has been expressly forbidden).","Praise be to Allah.Is sleeping after Fajr haram?
As far as a person’s sleeping after praying Fajr is concerned, no text (of Quran or hadith) has been reported to indicate that this is prohibited, so the general principle applies (i.e., everything is permitted except that which has been expressly forbidden).
But the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions after praying Fajr was to remain sitting in the place where they had prayed until the sun rose, as is reported in  Sahih Muslim (1/463) in the hadith of Sammak ibn Harb, who said: “I asked Jabir ibn Samurah, ‘Did you used to sit with the Messenger of Allah?’ He said, ‘Yes, frequently. He would not get up from the place where he had prayed Subh until the sun rose. When the sun rose, he would get up. They used to talk about things that had happened during the Jahiliyyah, and they would laugh and smile.’”
Also, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked his Lord to bless his ummah in the mornings, as is reported in the hadith of Sakhr al-Ghamidi, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, bless my ummah in the mornings.’ Whenever he sent out troops or an army, he would send them at the beginning of the day.’” Sakhr was a trader, and he used to send out his caravans at the beginning of the day, and he did well as a result and made money.” (Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, with an isnad in which there is some jahalah (i.e., one narrator is unknown); corroborating evidence is to be found in a hadith narrated by ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn Mas’ud and others, may Allah be pleased with them all.)
For this reason some of the salaf disliked the idea of sleeping after Fajr. Ibn Abi Shaybah reported in his
Musannaf (5/222, no. 25442) with a sahih isnad from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that he said: “Al-Zubayr used to forbid his children to sleep in the morning.” ‘Urwah said: “I do not hear of any man who sleeps in the morning, but I lose interest in that person.”
In summary then, people should make the most of this time which can bring many benefits in this world and in the Hereafter, but if a person sleeps at this time to gain strength to do his work, there is nothing wrong with this, especially if it is not easy for him to sleep at any other time of the day.
Ibn Abi Shaybah reported in his Musannaf (5/223, no. 25454) from the hadith of Abu Yazid al-Madini who said: “Umar came to Suhayb one morning and found him sleeping, so he sat down until he woke up. Suhayb said: ‘The Amir al-Muminin is sitting in his place and Suhayb is sleeping!’ ‘Umar said to him: ‘I did not like to disturb your sleep that could be beneficial for you.’”
Is sleeping after ‘Asr makruh?
As for sleeping after ‘Asr , this is also permitted; there is no sahih hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that sleeping at this time is prohibited.
As for the words, “Whoever sleeps after ‘Asr and loses his mind as a result has no-one to blame but himself,” which are attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this is a false hadith and there is no proof that these words were uttered by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (See: Silsilat al-Da’ifah, no. 39)

                My health is not very well and I get
      tired very easily. Sometimes I become clear from menses early in the morning at fajr time.
      Due to my health, making ghusl at that time would be a hardship for me. What should I do?",,"Praise be to Allah.Lord of the Worlds.
    First of all, we pray to Allaah to grant you healing and good health.
With regard to your question, if you become pure (i.e., your period
    ends) at the time of fajr (the pre-dawn prayer), then it becomes obligatory to
    perform ghusl (complete ablution) in order to perform the prayer. If you are not
    able to do ghusl because of your illness and inability to do it, then you should do
    tayammum (“dry ablution”). This means that you should strike bare earth
    once with the palms of your hands, then wipe your face, and the back of each hand with the
    palm of the other, then you should pray. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our

                What is the Arabic, English transliteration and the English meaning of khutbah al-Haajah. It is what the Imam says when the jumah starts.   I heard many speakers begin their talks with this and I would like to learn it. Insha'allah",,"Praise be to Allah.A number of hadeeth scholars, such as Imaam al-Nisaa'i (may Allaah have mercy on him), have reported Khutbah al-Haajah. Al-Nisaai reported that Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us Khutbat al-Haajah: Al-hamdu Lillaahi nastaeenahu wa nastaghfiruhu, wa naoodhu billaahi min shuroori anfusinaa wa sayiaati amaalinaa.

I bear witness that there is no (true) god but Allaah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). Then he recited the following three aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): Yaa ayyuhalladheena aamanu-ttaquLlaaha haqqa tuqaatihi wa laa tamootunna illaa wa antum muslimoon (O you who believe! Fear Allaah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam (as Muslims) with complete submission to Allaah.)

When you have finished washing the face, you start by washing the two hands, then wash each arm from the fingertips to the elbows. If you washed them before you washed your face, the first washing is Sunnah, but washing them after washing the face is fard (obligatory). Whoever only washes the arms between the wrists and elbows has not completed the obligatory action that is required of him, so he has to repeat his wudu after he finishes it, or he has to wash the parts he has omitted, if he did wudu recently, so he has to wash his two hands and what comes after that."

How was witchcraft used against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was the one whom no one could match in worship?",,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not harmed by that withcraft physically, mentally or spiritually, or with regard to the Message which he had been enjoined to convey. None of the people noticed or mentioned any change in his life or in his dealing with them, his salaah and adhkaar, or his teachings. The effect of that witchcraft had to do with his initmate relationship with his wives, or with some of his wives, and it was reported only by ‘Aa’ishah, who mentioned that he would imagine that he had had intercourse with his wives when in fact he had not. This effect did not have any impact upon the Message; it happened by the will and decree of Allaah, for a reason.

624,2071,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2071,When can a young man make ijtihaad and issue fatwas?,"Question

When can a young man make ijtihaad and issue fatwas? Some of the young people, when they become religious, indulge in examining and discussing the evidence (daleel) and speak about the rulings on events and issues that happen, in terms of what is halaal and what is haraam. They give their opinions on the rulings of fiqh on some new matters that have arisen in modern times.",,"Praise be to Allah.There are conditions attached to making ijtihaad. Not every individual has the right to issue fatwas and make pronouncements on matters, unless he has knowledge and is qualified. He has to be able to know the daleel; the wording and apparent meaning of the texts; what is saheeh (sound) and what is da’eef (weak); al-naasikh wa’l-mansookh (what abrogates what); wording and interpretation of texts; what is specific in application and what is general; what is stated in brief and what is mentioned in detail. This needs lengthy experience and practice, knowledge of the various branches of fiqh and where to look for information; knowledge of the opinions of the ‘ulamaa’ and fuqahaa’, and memorization or knowledge of the texts. Undoubtedly issuing fatwas without being qualified to do so is a grave sin, and means that one is speaking without knowledge. Allaah has warned us against that, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: “This is lawful and this is forbidden,” so as to invent lies against Allaah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allaah will never prosper.” [al-Nahl 16:116].
In a hadeeth: “Whoever was given a fatwaa with no proof, his sin will go back on the one who gave him the fatwaa.”
(Saheeh; narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 2/321). The seeker of knowledge should not hasten to issue fatwas or to speak on an issue until he has found the source and daleel for what he is saying, and who has spoken about it previously. If he is not qualified to deal with the matter, he should pass it on to someone who is better able to deal with it, and he should limit himself to that which he knows, and continue learning and studying until he is qualified to make ijtihaad. And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “The deceased is punished by the weeping of his family
    for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1286). This was explained
    as meaning, when a person had told his family to do that, as was done during the
    Jaahiliyyah. And it was said that it meant, if their custom was to weep and wail and he
    did not warn them. And it was said that it meant, he would feel hurt and saddened because
    they were doing something that would not help them at all; it does not refer to the
    punishment of the Fire. But simply mentioning the person, feeling grief and saying “Innaa
    Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our
    return)” – these actions are not included in this prohibition, because these
    feelings are something that overwhelm a person, and he cannot help thinking of the
    deceased, mentioning him, grieving for him and feeling sorrow because of his loss. If he
    mentions him, says “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon,” and

    it is not sufficient merely to wipe the head. A woman who wears her hair in braids is
    excused from having to undo her braids when doing ghusl because of janaabah, due to the
    difficulty involved in doing them up again. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth

However, after the prayer he has to do wudoo’ for the next prayer if something comes out after the first prayer, and he has to clean his clothes for the next prayer. He should try to wear a pad to absorb what comes out, so that it does not contaminate his clothes.

As Salaamu Alaikum: A situation arose last week between myself, my wife and her daughter. Her daughter is now 20 years old with her own child but still resides in the home with us. I said something to my wife that made her upset with me so she became very foul mouthed and ignorant with her behavior even though there were none Muslims in the home. She approached me in an ill manner and i just lightly mushed her in the face and started laughing. The next thing i know she is punching me and kicking me. I grabbed her so she would not hit me in my face anymore, that's when her daughter got into it and started hitting me in the head. I Kept my head and did not become upset. Then her daughter called the police and they came and questioned everyone and took down a report. My wife has not shown any remorse about the behavior of her daughter and acts as thou it was ok for her child to act in that manner. At the present time I am not in the same house with them. And i really don't want to go back there. But i truly care a lot for my wife and tries to strive with her in the way it is prescribed for us in the Quran and Sunnah. She only listens to Quran and Sunnah when there is no anger in her heart. This is a situation that has left my heart weak. Living true Islam is all that I am striving for. Please assist me in this matter.
As Salaamu Alaikum",,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that one of the main reasons that cause problems between spouses, and that could cause these problems to escalate to a very bad level is a lack of knowledge of the rights which each partner has over the other.
Islam states these rights clearly, and urges and obliges each partner to fulfil them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar (to those of their husbands) over them, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [al-Baqarah 2:228]. This aayah indicates that for every right that one partner has, there is a corresponding duty which the other partner must fulfil; thus balance will be achieved in all aspects of the relationship, which will strengthen the stability of family life. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said concerning this aayah: It is their (womens) right to good companionship and proper treatment on the part of their husbands, and their duty to obey and do what their husbands tell them to do. Ibn Zayd said: Fear Allaah with regard to them (wives) just as they should fear Allaah with regard to you. Al-Qurtubi said: This aayah covers all the rights and duties within marriage.
One of those rights is that trivial mistakes should be overlooked, especially words and deeds by which no harm was intended. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every son of Adam makes mistakes, and the best of those who make mistakes are those who repent.
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2501; Saheeh al-Jaami, 4/171).
Both husband and wife have to be patient and put up with one another, because everyone makes mistakes, and the one with whom you have to be most patient is the one with whom you live and interacts with most. Neither party should resort to tit-for-tat reactions. If one spouse sees that the other is very angry, he or she should restrain his or her own anger, and not respond immediately. For this reason Abul-Darda said to his wife: If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I see you angry, I will calm you down, otherwise it will be too difficult to live together. The imaam of Ahl al-Sunnah, Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) married Abbaasah
bint al-Mufaddal, the mother of his son Saalih, and he used to say of her: Umm Saalih lived with me for twenty years, and we never argued over the slightest thing.
One of the most important rights/duties is that each spouse should advise and remind the other to obey Allaah. It is reported in a saheeh hadeeth that a group of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Teach us which kind of wealth is best, so that we may try to acquire it? He said: The best is a remembering tongue (one that remembers Allaah), a grateful heart and a believing wife who helps ones faith.
(Reported by Ahmad, 5/278; al-Tirmidhi, 3039; Saheeh al-Jaami, 5231).
A man should not make his wife angry if he sees in her something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another, so he should balance the two. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No believing man should hate a believing woman: if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another.
(Reported by Muslim, 36). Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Woman was created from a rib, and if you try to straighten a rib you will break it, so deal with her gently. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/8; Ibn Hibbaan, 1308; Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/163).
One of the best ways to ensure a good atmosphere between husband and wife is a good attitude, hence Islam placed an important emphasis on this matter. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the ultimate in good treatment of others and good attitude. Abul-Darda reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no good deed that will be put in the balance that will weight heavier than a good attitude. The one who has a good attitude will reach, because of it, the level of those who fast and pray.
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The most perfect of the believers in faith are the best in attitude, and the best of you are those who are best to their womenfolk. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1/217; Ahmad, 2/250; Al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 284).
Some of the ways in which one can treat ones wife well are to turn a blind eye and not to pick on things, great or small, and not to rebuke or scold for every single incident, except in the case of duties towards Allaah. This is how Allaah guides us in the Quraan, when He says (interpretation of the meaning): and live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good. [al-Nisa 4:19]. If a woman disobeys her husband and refuses to obey him, he has the right to discipline her as prescribed by shareeah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they (spend) to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and their husbands) and guard in the husbands absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g., their chastity, their husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great. [al-Nisa 4:34]. This aayah indicates that the husband has the right to discipline his wife when she disobeys his orders or rebels against him, and that this discipline takes a step-by-step approach which may reach the level of hitting, within certain conditions. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Know that Allaah does not command hitting in His Book in clear terms except in this passage and with regard to the prescribed punishments (hudood), so disobedience to husbands is equated with major sins, and Allaah has given the task (of disciplining) to husbands, instead of leaders, and without the need for judges, witnesses or evidence, because Allaah has entrusted wives to their husbands.
Ill-conduct (nushooz) here refers to disobedience, i.e., those on whose part you fear disobedience and rejection of Allaahs command to obey their husbands. Allaah has made this discipline in stages, as follows:


Admonition without forsaking them (refusing to share their beds) or hitting them. So the woman is reminded of her duty to be a good companion and treat her husband properly. If gentle admonition and kindly reminders do not work, then the discipline is taken to the second stage:


Forsaking, by turning his back on her in bed or sleeping in a separate bed. But he should not go to extremes in this by keeping away for more than four months, which is the period set by Allaah for the one that swears not to approach his wife. This forsaking should only be for the purposes of disciplining and correcting, not for taking revenge or punishing.


Hitting in a manner that is not painful, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): beat them (lightly, if it is useful),. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Forsake her in her bed, and if she mends her ways (this is good), but if not, then Allaah has given permission for you to hit her in a way that is not painful. The husband must be careful to ensure that his hitting is for the purpose of discipline and warning, and not for any other purpose, so he must make sure that he hits as lightly as possible, by prodding with the fist and so on. Ata said: I said to Ibn Abbaas: What is the hitting that is not painful? He said, The siwaak (tooth-stick) and so on. (i.e., hitting with the siwaak).


The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, advising his ummah: Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allaah and they are lawful to you by the word of Allaah. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, so if they do that then hit them in a way that is not painful.
(Saheeh hadeeth). The husband should avoid hitting parts of the body that are sensitive, such as the head and stomach, and the face, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade hitting the face in general. Muaawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over us? He said, That you feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, and that you do not say May Allaah make your face ugly or hit her i.e., in the face. (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446).
If she desists, and stops rebelling, then he is not allowed to keep punishing her or to accuse her of saying or doing anything, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance).
With regard to your particular situation, we do not know all the details or the reason why you hit your wife or why she and her daughter attacked you. But we do understand that you are the one who started it, you started by hitting her then you made her angry by laughing at her, which is when the mistake on her part and that of her daughter occurred. What we advise you to do is to let your wife come back to you and go back to living together in one home. You should advise your wife to admit that she has made a mistake, and explain to her the seriousness what she has done by disobeying you, hitting you back and encouraging her daughter to misbehave towards you as you mentioned. This girl must understand that she is a guest in the home of her mothers husband and she has to respect the one who has given her refuge in his home. If her presence is making things more complicated and causing more problems, then you must come to some agreement with them for the girl to move to her own home. Seek the help of Allaah, have patience and treat your wife well. We ask Allaah to help you all and create love between your hearts. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

     I am a Muslim female.  Two years ago I went through a love experience
      with a young Muslim man,who was divorced. I liked him,and in fact I loved him.
   Then he asked me for making love, so I told him that I don't do that as I
      am religious and that this is zinah.
    So he told me i have to make love to you then i will marry you.  Anyway, for two years, he is pushing me and twisting my arm to
      make love with him and that then he will marry me and i keep on refusing sex before
      marriage.
    In spite of all of that I am a strong Muslim and I can stand torture for
      not to commit any sin with him.
    My question is that how can I forget the torture and the very unfair

                I posed a question #1599 a few months ago concerning disinheriting ones offspring particularly if the person disobeys his/her parents in matrimonial matters. For example, if the man marries a non-Muslimah.  It is a commonly held idea that a Muslim man can marry a jewish or christian. These days such a person is hard to find in the west. Religion is as distant from theses people as sun from our planet.
Are today's Catholic protestants etc. truly ""People of the Book""?
It is surley Haraam for a Muslimah to marry a non-Muslim man?  Yet we see this is becoming a trend among many Muslim girls.  May Allah protect us all.
Jazakumallah.",,"Praise be to Allah.A Muslim is permitted to marry a woman of the People of the Book, Jewish or Christian, so long as she is chaste and modest, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (Lawful for you in marriage) are chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time [al-Maaidah 5:5]. But this is not recommended, especially for a Muslim who is living in a kaafir country under their laws and legislation.
It is not permissible for a Muslim woman under any circumstances to marry a non-believer (kaafir), whether he is of the People of the Book or otherwise, chaste or not, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): they [believing women] are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahinah 60:10]
Todays Christians, so long as they claim to belong to, revere and follow Jesus (Eesaa), are among the People of the Book, and the rulings concerning the People of the Book that are recorded in the Quraan and Sunnah apply to them, but at the same time we regard them as kaafirs who have gone astray.
Even if a Muslim son marries a non-Muslim woman, his parents are still not permitted to disinherit him so long as he is still a Muslim and has not committed any offence which would put him beyond the pale of Islam. Anyone who does something that causes a Muslim to be deprived of his inheritance has transgressed the limits of Allaah, wronged himself and committed a grave major sin (kabeerah). Allaah rules as He wills and does as He wills."
631,2090,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2090,Why does Allaah    speak in the plural in the Qur’an?,"Question

                Why does Allah(SWT) at times speak in the plural form in the Quran?
Jazak Allah Khair.",,"Praise be to Allah.The answer is in two parts:


In general terms, every believer must believe that every action of Allaah has great wisdom behind it, and there is no need for it to be explained in full to every person. This is a kind of test, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… that He may test you which of you is best in deed…” [al-Mulk 67:2]


To answer this question in more detail: the Qur’aan was revealed in the language of the Arabs, and in Arabic it is as correct to use the plural when speaking of one person as it is to use the singular. But the plural is used for respect and glorification, and no one is more deserving of respect and glorification than Allaah. So the singular is used to affirm the fact that He is One and has no partner or associate, and the plural is used to affirm His glory and majesty, may He be exalted.


Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote in Majmaoo’ al-Fataawaa (5/128) some words which may be of interest to us here:
“With regard to Allaah’s closeness to us, sometimes it is mentioned in the singular, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them) I am indeed near (to them by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me…’ [al-Baqarah 2:186] and the hadeeth: ‘The One on Whom you call is closer to any one of you than the neck of his riding-camel’, and sometimes in the plural, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein’ [Qaaf 50:16]. This is like the aayaat (interpretation of the meanings): ‘We recite to you…’ [al-Qasas 28:3] and ‘We relate unto you…’ [Yoosuf 12:3]. Such usage in Arabic refers to the one who is great and has helpers who obey him; when his helpers do something by his command, he says ‘We did it,’ as a king might say, ‘We conquered this land and we defeated this army,’ and so on.”

    because one of the conditions of inheritance is that the heir should be alive after the
    death of the person from whom he or she is to inherit. This condition is not met in this

    The grandfathers estate should be divided among his own heirs, so his children, for

I would be very grateful to Allah and to our cheikh (jazaahullahu kairan) if he could answer a question that is very important to me. I would like to know whether Allah could answer my prayer if I asked him to change one or more aspects about my personality, which he created in me (jabalani alaihaa), so that it becomes as part of my natural characteristics.",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah is Able to do all things, and if you pray to Him sincerely, he will answer your du`a. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
""And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicants when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright."" [al-Baqarah 2:186]
 
Among the evidence that du`a may have the benefit of eliminating problematic characteristics is the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: ""Abu Salamah came to me one day after being with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: 'I heard from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) something that made me very happy. He said, ""There is no calamity that befalls one of the Muslims and he responds by saying 'Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilahi raaji'oon (Truly, to Allah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall return),' then he says, 'Allahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha (O Allah, reward me in this calamity and compensate me with something better than it),' but Allah will do that for him.""'"" Umm Salamah said: ""I learnt this from him, and when Abu Salamah died, I said, 'Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilahi raaji'oon,' then , 'Allahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha,' Then I thought to myself, Where could I find anyone better than Abu Salamah? When my 'iddah (waiting-period) was over, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked permission to see me, whilst I was busy dyeing a hide. I washed the qaraz (a kind of dye derived from a certain plant) from my hands and granted him permission, putting out for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibres. He sat down on it, and asked for my hand in marriage. When he had finished what he had to say, I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I do not want you to lose interest in me, but I am a very jealous woman, and I am afraid that you may see in me something that could earn me the punishment of Allah. I am also a woman who is ageing, and I have children.' He said, 'As for the jealousy you mentioned, Allah will take this away from you (according to another report: as for you saying that you are a jealous woman, I will pray to Allah to take away your jealousy). As for what you say about age, the same applies to me as to you. As for your children, your children are my children.' So I accepted his offer and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married me. Allah gave me someone even better than Abu Salamah, namely the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).""
 
These two reports are in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad. The hadeeth was also reported by Muslim from Umm Salamah, who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'There is no Muslim who suffers a calamity and says what Allah has commanded: ""Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raji'oon, Allahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha,"" but Allah will compensate him with something better.' When Abu Salamah died, I said, 'Who among the Muslims could be better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?' Then I said [this du`a] and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He sent Haatib ibn Abi Balta'ah on his behalf to ask for my hand in marriage, but I said, 'I have a daughter, and I am a jealous woman.' He said, 'As for your daughter, we will pray to Allah to make her independent, and I will pray to Allah to take away your jealousy.'"" (Reported by Muslim, 1525).
 
I want to tell you, my brother, that the sincere person whose du`as are answered has to be completely honest with Allah in the way he strives to rid himself of bad characteristics and to acquire good characteristics. If you want proof of this, it is to be found in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Whoever seeks to be patient, Allah will give him patience."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1376). He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: ""Knowledge comes by learning and patience comes by making oneself be patient."" (Reported by al-Daraqutni and others; classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami', 2328).
 
Allah has created the means of getting results, so you must pay attention to the laws of Allah that govern His creation. Use the means of acquiring good characteristics and avoiding bad characteristics so that you may get the results you want. You must strive hard and call on Allah. Allah will not betray the hopes of His slaves or cause their hard work and efforts to be lost or wasted."

With regard to the child, he belongs to his mother, and should not be

    not be named after his father because he was conceived in fornication, not in wedlock. It
    is obligatory to take care of this child and bring him up with Islamic manners and morals.
    Because this immoral act has occurred, you must repent from it, but you should cover it up
    and not disclose it; you do not have to tell the people the truth. If the child wants to
    know the truth, you can tell him in an appropriate manner, and let him know that what
    happened was in the days of kufr (before you became Muslim), and that when a person
    repents and becomes Muslim, this wipes out whatever happened before. The child does not
    bear any responsibility for what happened, and as long as his mother has become Muslim,
    there is no grounds for rebuking or punishing her. It is obligatory to accept the will and
    decree of Allaah, and if this child does righteous deeds he will enter Paradise. No soul

We do not have any information about homosexuality in Malaysia, but we assume that the Muslims there feel total abhorrence towards this shameful act, because their religion, Islam, emphatically forbids this deed and prescribes a severe punishment for it, in this world and the next. 
How could it be otherwise, when the Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lut (Lot), kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done"" - i.e. if it is done with consent.

Punishment for homosexuality 
The scholars of Islam, such as Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaq said that (the person guilty of this crime ) should be stoned, whether he is married or unmarried.
Is homosexuality a sin?
There is no doubt that homosexuality , which goes against the pure human nature created by Allah, by making men content with men and women with women, destroying families, adversely affecting the birth rate, causing the spread of killer diseases, harming the innocent when children are raped, and generally spreading corruption on earth, should be uprooted and stamped out.

The Prophet's Prayer, it says one should place one's hands on the ground before the knees - and quotes hadith supporting this (claiming knees before hand is as the camel and not advisable. Is there a correct way?","Malik, Al-Awza`i and the scholars of Hadith thought that one should go to Sujud hands first, based on the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah said: “When any one of you prostrates, let him not go down as the camel does; let him put his hands down before his knees.”","Praise be to Allah.The scholars have differed as to how one should go down in Sujud , whether one should go hands first or knees first. 
According to the Hanafis, Shafi`is and one opinion narrated from Ahmad, the person who is praying should go down on his knees first, then on his hands. 
At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that this was the opinion of the majority of scholars, and said in his Sunan (2/57): 
“This is how it is done according to the majority of scholars: they think that a man should go down on his knees before he puts his hands down, and when he gets up he should raise his hands before his knees. Those who express this opinion take as evidence the Hadith of Wa’il ibn Hijr, who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he did Sujud , putting his knees down before his hands, and when he got up he raised his hands before his knees. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, At-Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Ad-Daraqutni, 1/345) 
He said: 
“The only one who narrated it was Yazid ibn Harun from Shurayk. Nobody reported from Asim ibn Kulayb except Shurayk, and Shurayk is not strong. 
Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Sunan (2/101): ‘Its chain of narrators is weak.” Al-Albani classed it as inauthentic in Al-Mishkat (898) and Al-Irwa (2/75)
Other scholars classed it as authentic, such as Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in Zad Al-Ma`ad). 
Among those who thought that one should go down into Sujud knees first were Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them); contemporary scholars who favour this view include Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz and Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them).
Malik, Al-Awza`i and the scholars of Hadith (may Allah have mercy on them) thought that one should go into Sujud hands first, based on the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When any one of you prostrates, let him not go down as the camel does; let him put his hands down before his knees. (Narrated by Ahmad, 2/381, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa’i) 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (3/421): “It was reported by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i with a good chain of narrators.” 
It was classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’ (2/78), who said: This is an authentic chain of narrators, all of whose men are trustworthy, the men of Muslim, apart from Muhammad ibn `Abdullah ibn Al-Hasan, also known as An-Nafs Az-Zakiyyah Al-Alawi, who is trustworthy)
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) made a valuable comment on this matter in Al-Fatawa (22/449): 
“Praying in both ways is permissible, according to the consensus of the scholars. If a person wants to go down knees first or hands first, his prayer is valid in either case, according to the consensus of the scholars, but they disputed as to which is preferable.”
The scholar should act upon whichever opinion he believes is more likely to be correct, and the ordinary Muslim should follow the opinion of a scholar whom he trusts.

What is the nature of the authority of the Quran according to Orthodox Islamic tradition?",,"Praise be to Allah.The Quran was revealed by Allah, may He be glorified, as a law and a reference as to what is permissible and prohibited, what is commanded and forbidden, for people to follow, so that they obey its commands and abide by its prohibitions, take what it allows as permissible and take what it prohibits as forbidden. The Quran tells us about what happened before and what is yet to come, and it is a reference for judging between us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… We have neglected nothing in the Book…” [6:38].
After the Revelation was completed, Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): “… This day, I have perfected your religion for you…” [5:3].
The Sunnah [words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] came to explain and complement the Quran. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Quran and something like it with it.” The phrase “something like it with it” refers to the Sunnah. (saheeh/authentic hadeeth).
Allah commanded us to refer to these two constitutional references, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): “…if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger…” [4:59].

There is a converted christian who does not believe in Quran.
We had many arguments over this issue, still he does not believe in Muhammed being a prophet of God, . I somehow feel that I should help him in knowing the actual truth.
Can you help me regarding this matter.
He Believes in Bible completely and follows it and has memorised it . But is unable to understand the importance of Quran.",,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, it is essential to understand that guidance to the true religion of Islam and belief in the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the message he brought comes about only by the help of Allah, and that we are required to explain this and produce evidence of it.
There is a great deal of clear evidence for the one who seeks to find out the truth about the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), including the following:


Allah chose him even though he had grown up as an orphan and was illiterate, knowing neither how to read or write. All good qualities and virtues were perfected in him, to the point of ultimate perfection. All these good qualities were combined and firmly established in him, something which no one else can attain except the Prophets whom Allah protected and guided. This combination of perfect qualities is one of the greatest proofs of the truth of his Prophethood (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).


The revelation of Allah was bestowed upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Angel of Revelation, Jibreel (Gabriel), who is recognized by all the People of the Book [Jews and Christians], came to him, and when he received revelation, there were unusual effects on him that indicated the intensity of the effort involved in receiving the Message of Allah from Jibreel, upon whom be peace. His Companions witnessed this when he received Revelation, and they believed that the revelation was something that came from an outside source and was beyond his control; it came to him from (Allah), the Wise and Praiseworthy.


Allah supported the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with physical miracles, with which he challenged his people. Among the most important of these were the splitting of the moon and the Night Journey to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). They were unable to match these miracles, and so they were a decisive, divine testimony to the truth of his Prophethood (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).


Allah supported him with miracles and evidence for people of reason and understanding, the greatest of which was the Quran. This was the greatest sign, which contains in its pages miracles of both style and content, which all of mankind cannot match or imitate, even if they gather together for that purpose. This is clear from the statements of the most eloquent of the Arabs, who were completely unable to match it. The Quran was – and centuries later still is, praise be to Allah – an eternal miracle as is evident in its brilliant style, its information about the Unseen, its fulfilment of the promises of Allah, the superiority of its laws, and the fact that its rulings are appropriate for every time and place – in addition to the fact that it has such a moving impact on people’s hearts.


The Quran refers to the signs and proofs surrounding the person of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which testify to his truthfulness. For example, he was free of sin and trivial spitefulness; he grew up illiterate in the Arabian Peninsula, and did not receive any religious knowledge from beyond its borders, nor did he spend time acquiring any religious knowledge. When he reached the age of forty, he brought divine knowledge that none of the earlier or later generations could produce. He also received special protection and care from Allah, which kept him safe at times of crisis; if it were not for this protection he would most certainly have been doomed to destruction. None of this could have happened except to one who was truly sent from Allah.


His coming was foretold in the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel), and some of the People of the Book saw that these prophecies applied in totality to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which led them to embrace Islam. There are still passages in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testaments, in the versions that are accepted by the People of the Book, that clearly refer to the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – for example in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is considered by Christians to be the most authentic Gospel.


The Message of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not unique to him, but was in nature and content similar to the message brought by other Messengers before him. Allah had sent Prophets and Messengers, such as Moosa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) and others, to the Children of Israel, and great numbers had believed in them and borne witness to the truth of their Books, which were similar in general terms to the message brought by the Quran. This was eloquent testimony to the truth of the Message with which he was sent, especially as it belonged to the same type of Message to whose truth they had testified.


When Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with the same Message as the Prophets who had come before him, the Quran came to confirm their Books and their Prophethood, and to call people to believe in them. So when the People of the Book disbelieved in him and his Book, it meant that they were disbelieving in their own Books and Messengers. As the Quran contained the same principles as their books, and confirmed them, this meant that it was the least likely to be fabricated or to have come from a source other than Allah, because all of them came from Allah, may He be exalted.


In summary, then, the proof of truthfulness is quite clear in this case. The evidence is there both in (historical) reports and on the grounds of common sense. This will cure the ill (i.e., the one who has doubts) and quench the thirst (of the one who longs for knowledge), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Indeed, there has come to you from Allah a Light (prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) and a plain Book (the Quran), wherewith Allah guides all those who seek His Good Pleasure to ways of peace, and He brings them out of darkness by His Will unto light, and guides them to a Straight Way” [al-Maa’idah 5:15-16].
In order to provide the Christian mentioned in the question with proof and evidence, it should be sufficient to give him a translation of the meanings of the Quran. If he believes, then praise be to Allah, and if he turns away, then destroy not yourself in sorrow for him (cf. Faatir 35:8). Allah leaves astray whom He will and guides whom He will, and He is the Most Knowing of Guides."

Are you allowed to donate or receive organs, since I have seen no direct prohibition on organ transpants in the Quran.",,"Praise be to Allah.This subject is one of the topics which is being researched by the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami), which has issued the following fatwaa:


It is permitted to transplant or graft an organ from one part of a person’s body to another, so long as one is careful to ascertain that the benefits of this operation outweigh any harm that may result from it, and on the condition that this is done to replace something that has been lost, or to restore its appearance or regular function, or to correct some fault or disfigurement which is causing physical or psychological distress.


It is permitted to transplant an organ from one person’s body to another, if it is an organ that can regenerate itself, like skin or blood, on the condition that the donor is mature and understands what he is doing, and that all other pertinent shar’i conditions are met.


It is permitted to use part of an organ that has been removed because of illness to benefit another person, such as using the cornea of an eye removed because of illness.


It is haraam to take an organ on which life depends, such as taking a heart from a living person to transplant into another person.


It is haraam to take an organ from a living person when doing so could impair an essential vital function, even though his life itself may not be under threat, such as removing the corneas of both eyes. However, removing organs which will lead to only partial impairment is a matter which is still under scholarly discussion.


It is permitted to transplant an organ from a dead person to a living person whose life depends on receiving that organ, or whose vital functions are otherwise impaired, on the condition that permission is given either by the person before his death or by his heirs, or by the leader of the Muslims in cases where the dead person’s identity is unknown or he has no heirs.


Care should be taken to ensure that there is proper agreement to the transplant of organs in the cases described above, on the condition that no buying or selling of organs is involved. It is not permitted to trade in human organs under any circumstances. But the question of whether the beneficiary may spend money to obtain an organ he needs, or to show his appreciation, is a matter which is still under scholarly debate.


Anything other than the scenarios described above is still subject to scholarly debate, and requires further detailed research in the light of medical research and shar’i rulings.

I am a ""New"" Muslim (or recently converted) and I thank Allah for guiding me to this truly happiest move I've made in my life.

I'm also very interested in voluntary fasting and besides fasting Thursdays, I've been also fasting during the White Days (13,14,15 every month). However, I've realized that I've been fasting 13,14,15 according to Georgian, normal calendar, and not according to an Islamic one! Is what I have done really wrong? Does it annul my fasting? What shall I do in the future? Thank you very much in advance!","The timing of the White Days fasting is worked out according to the lunar months of the Hijri or Islamic calendar, not the solar months of the Gregorian or Western calendar.","Praise be to Allah.First of all, congratulations on the blessing of Allah which you have received, as He has guided you to this religion and caused you to enjoy the sweetness of obedience and worship through fasting, which is one of the greatest forms of worship. Here we will explain in brief the virtues of fasting.
Virtues of fasting
The virtues of fasting are immense, and a number of sound hadiths state this, such as the following:

Fasting is something which is just for Allah, and Allah will give multiple rewards without measure for it. The hadith says: [Allah says:] Fasting is Mine and it is I Who give reward for it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1904)

There is nothing equivalent to fasting. (Al-Nasai, 4/165; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/413)

The supplication (du’a) of the fasting person will not be refused. (Reported by al-Bayhaqi, 3/345; see also al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 1797)
The one who fasts has two joys: the joy of breaking his fast and, when he meets his Lord, the joy of having fasted. (Reported by Muslim, 2/807)
Fasting will be an intercession for the slave on the Day of Resurrection, when it will say: O Lord, I stopped him from eating and drinking during the day, so let me intercede for him. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/174; al-Bayhaqi classed its isnad as hasan in al-Mujtama, 3/181; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411)
The smell (coming from the mouth of) the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk. (Muslim, 2/808).
Fasting is a protection and a strong fortress against the Fire. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/402; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411 and Sahih al-Jami’, 3880)
Whoever fasts one day for the sake of Allah, Allah will keep his face seventy years distance away from the Fire because of it. (Reported by Muslim, 2/808)
Whoever fasts a day seeking the pleasure of Allah and then dies [i.e. that is the last thing he does] will enter Paradise. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/391; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/412)
In Paradise, there is a gate called al-Rayyan, through which those who fast will enter, and no-one else will enter through it. After they have entered, it will be locked and no-one else will enter it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1797).
Voluntary fasts will make up for any shortfall in obligatory fasts. Examples of voluntary fasts include ‘Ashura , the Day of ‘Arafah , al-Ayam al-Bid (the White Days), Mondays and Thursdays , six days of Shawwal , and increased fasting during the months of al-Muharram and Sha’ban.

What are the White Days?
What is meant by al-Ayyam al-Bid is the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each lunar month, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.” [al-Baqarah 2:189] 
So the timing of certain acts of worship and the ‘iddah (waiting period for women who have been divorced or widowed, etc.) are worked out according to the lunar months of the Hijri or Islamic calendar, not the solar months of the Gregorian or Western calendar. 
The fasts which you have observed according to the solar calendar most likely do not correspond with the lunar calendar, but in any case you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for the days that you have fasted, because you have fasted them voluntarily for the sake of Allah. But if you wish to earn the reward that is specifically for fasting Ayyam al-Bid, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do, you should find out the timings according to the lunar calendar and fast according to it.
We ask Allah to increase His blessings upon you, to help you adhere to His religion, to give you the strength to do that which will please Him and to increase your reward, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. Do not forget us in your prayers whilst you are fasting. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

646,2127,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2127,Conditions of Wali (Guardian) in Islam,"Question

What exactly constitutes a guardian, as is needed in the marriage ceremony. I am a female Muslim, and I want to know if my older brother is acceptable for this role.","Conditions of the wali are as follows: He should be of sound mind, an adult, free (not a slave), of the same religion as the bride, of good character, be male, be wise and mature.","Praise be to Allah.Pillars of marriage in Islam
There are three pillars or conditions for the marriage contract in Islam:

Both parties should be free of any obstacles that might prevent the marriage from being valid, such as their being mahrams of one another (i.e., close relatives who are permanently forbidden to marry), whether this relationship is through blood ties or through breastfeeding etc., or where the man is a non-Muslim and the woman is a Muslim, and so on.
There should be an offer or proposal (ijab) from the wali or the person who is acting in his place, who should say to the groom “I marry so-and-so to you” or similar words.
There should be an expression of acceptance (qabul) on the part of the groom or whoever is acting in his place, who should say, “I accept,” or similar words.

Conditions of marriage in Islam
The conditions of a proper marriage contract are as follows:

Both the bride and groom should be clearly identified, whether by stating their names or describing them, etc. 
Both the bride and groom should be pleased with one another, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No previously-married woman (widow or divorcee) may be married until she has been asked about her wishes (i.e., she should state clearly her wishes), and no virgin should be married until her permission has been asked (i.e., until she has agreed either in words or by remaining silent).” They asked, “O Messenger of Allah, how is her permission given (because she will feel very shy)?” He said: “By her silence.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4741)
The one who does the contract on the woman’s behalf should be her wali, as Allah addressed the walis with regard to marriage (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry those among you who are single…” [al-Nur 24:32] and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who marries without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1021 and others; it is a sound hadith)

The marriage contract must be witnessed , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage contract except with a wali and two witnesses.” (Reported by al-Tabarani; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7558) 
Conditions of the wali
The conditions of the wali are as follows:

He should be of sound mind
He should be an adult
He should be free (not a slave)
He should be of the same religion as the bride. A non-Muslim cannot be the wali of a Muslim , male or female, and a Muslim cannot be the wali of a kafir, male or female, but a non-Muslim can be the wali of a non-Muslim woman for marriage purposes, even if they are of different religions. An apostate (one who has left Islam) cannot be a wali for anybody.
He should be of good character (‘adalah – includes piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), as opposed to being corrupt. This is a condition laid down by some scholars, although some of them regard the outward appearance of good character as being sufficient, and some say that it is enough if he is judged as being able to pay proper attention to the interests of the woman for whom he is acting as wali in the matter of her marriage.
He should be male, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman may conduct the marriage contract of another woman, and no woman can conduct the marriage contract on behalf of her own self, because the zaniyah (fornicatress, adulteress) is the one who arranges things on her own behalf.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 1782; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7298)

He should be wise and mature, which means being able to understand matters of compatibility and the interests of marriage.
Order of who can take the role of the wali
The jurists put possible walis in a certain order, and a wali who is more closely-related should not be ignored unless there is no such person or the relatives do not meet the specified conditions. 

A woman’s wali is her father, 
then whoever her father may have appointed before his death, 
then her paternal grandfather or great-grandfather,
then her son, then his sons or grandsons, 
then her brother through both parents (full brother), 
then her brother through her father, 
then the sons of her brother through both parents, 
then the sons of her brother through her father, 
then her uncle (her father’s brother through both parents),
then her father’s brother through the father,
then the sons of her father’s brother though both parents, 
then the sons of her father’s brother through the father, 
then whoever is more closely related, and so on – as is the case with inheritance. 
The Muslim leader (or his deputy, such as a judge) is the wali for any woman who does not have a wali of her own.

Is it permissible to obtain a fixed rate mortgage from a british bank in order to purchase a house.",,"Praise be to Allah.If the bank owns the house, then it is permissible for it to sell it to you for a fixed price, whether payment is deferred or made in installments, even if this will cost more than paying the full price for it immediately. This is according to the more sound opinion among the scholars.
But if the bank is involved in this transaction as the supplier or lender of funds, which you then have to repay with some extra, then this is clearly an interest-based transaction, which is undoubtedly haraam.
It may be almost impossible to avoid interest-based transactions when dealing with real estate in many countries, and one may hardly be able to find any halaal alternative, but the Muslim must bear this with patience and seek out halaal means. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (of every difficulty). And He will provide for him from (sources) he could never imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.

      correction.

    marriage was contracted through an offer or proposal (eejaab) from the walee
    (guardian) of the bride and acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom, with the
    consent of the bride, in front of two Muslim witnesses of good character (as regards
    piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), then the marriage contract is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: “A marriage is not properly contracted unless there
    are two Muslim witnesses, regardless of whether the bride and groom are both Muslims or
    only the groom is. This is what Ahmad stated, and it is also the opinion of
    al-Shaafi’i.” (Al-Mughni, 9/349; al-Mufaddal fi Ahkaam

    her non-Muslim guardian, but if she becomes Muslim, this role can only be played by a
    Muslim. If she has no Muslim walee, then this role can be delegated to the director of the
    Islamic Centre or whoever is acting in his stead. As regards the children who were born
    during this time, they are the children of the man and should be given his name, as is the

The Islamic Fiqh Council has researched the matter of dealing in bonds and issued the following statement:


Bonds which represent a commitment to pay the face value plus interest, or conditional benefits, are haraam according to sharee’ah, whether one is buying, selling or handling them, because they are considered to be interest-based loans. This applies whether they are issued by private companies or by public bodies run by the state. The fact that they are forbidden is not affected by giving them other names such as “certificates”, “investment documents” or “savings”, or calling the interest “profit”, “commission” or “returns”.


Also forbidden are bonds that offer prizes, because these are loans made on the condition that the benefits or increase will go to the group loaning the money, or to one of them, who is not specified at the time of investment, in addition to the fact that this is based on the idea of gambling.


AFrom the alternatives to forbidden bonds, to sell, buy or handle, is bonds or documents based on bidding for a specific project or activity from which the owners will not benefit in any definite way, but will only receive a share of the profits according to the number of bonds or documents that they own, and they will only receive this profit if the project is actually carried out.

659,2148,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2148,Is It Permissible to Seek Medication?,"Question

What is the ruling on giving medication in Islam, especially in cases of diseases where there is no hope of a cure? Is it necessary to obtain the patient’s permission before giving treatment, particularly in emergency situations?","1.	Seeking medication is obligatory in cases where not giving medication could cause death, disability or the loss of a limb, or where the sickness is bound to spread if not treated, as in contagious diseases.
2.	Treatment and medication are ways of utilizing the laws of cause and effect that Allah has incorporated into the running of the universe. 
3.	Seeking the patient’s permission depends on whether he is qualified to give it (i.e., he should be of sound mind, mature and responsible). If this is not the case, then the permission of his guardian should be sought, within the limits set by Shari`ah.","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to seek medication?
The governing principle is that it is allowed to seek medication because of what has been narrated to this effect in the Quran and Sunnah, i.e., the words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because it involves saving lives, which is one of the overall aims of Shari`ah.
The rulings governing the issue of seeking medication differ according to the circumstances and people involved:

Seeking medication is obligatory in cases where not giving medication could cause death, disability or the loss of a limb, or where the sickness is bound to spread if not treated, as in contagious diseases.
It is encouraged in cases where not giving medication may weaken a person physically, and it is not as bad as the cases mentioned above.
It is allowed in cases which are not covered in the two preceding categories.
It is discouraged in cases where the treatment could lead to complications that are worse than the original complaint.

Treatment of cases where recovery is hopeless 

The Muslim believes that disease and cure are matters that are under the control of Allah, may He be glorified. Treatment and medication are ways of utilizing the laws of cause and effect that Allah has incorporated into the running of the universe.  It is not permitted to despair of the mercy of Allah – there should always be the hope of healing by the permission of Allah.  The doctors and families should try to raise the morale of those who are sick and continue their efforts to relieve the mental and physical suffering of the patient regardless of whether a cure is expected or not.
Deeming a situation to be hopeless is based only on doctors’ opinions, the state of medical science in any given time or place, and the circumstances of the patient himself.

Should we seek the patient’s permission to give him medication?

Seeking the patient’s permission depends on whether he is qualified to give it (i.e., he should be of sound mind, mature, and responsible). If this is not the case, then the permission of his guardian should be sought, within the limits set by Shari`ah which requires the guardian to take care of a person’s interests and protect him from harm. No attention should be paid to the guardian’s refusal to give permission if this is obviously going to harm the person. In this case, guardianship has to be transferred to another guardian, or to the Muslim leader.
The Muslim leader has the right to force medication in certain situations, such as a case of contagious disease, or the giving of vaccines or when taking preventive measures to control the spread of diseases.
In an emergency where lives are at stake, treatment can be administered without waiting for permission or consent.
When carrying out medical research, there must be total agreement on the part of suitably qualified subjects, with no element of compulsion (such as using prisoners for research) or financial compulsion (such as using the poor), and no harm must result from this research.  It is not permitted to carry out medical research on people who are unable to give their consent, even if their guardians agree to it."

Some vendors stipulate that people who want to buy or rent a product must first pay a deposit; if the purchaser or renter later changes his mind, the vendor keeps the deposit. What is the ruling on this matter?",,"Praise be to Allah.The matter being discussed here is that of down-payments, which means that the purchaser pays an amount of money to the vendor in advance, and this is taken as part of the price paid for the product. If the purchaser doesn’t buy the product, the vendor keeps the deposit. It is classified under the heading of “sales and rentals”, because it is the sale of the benefits of the product. There is a hadeeth which forbids sales involving down-payments, but it is da’eef (weak). There are certain cases in which making a down-payment is not permitted, such as forward buying (bay’ al-salam) [???], and the sale of money for money, and of gold and silver, because in all these cases the whole amount must be handed over at the time of drawing up the contract. Sales on the basis of a down-payment are not permitted in these cases.
Sales involving down-payments are permitted if a specific waiting-period is stipulated, and both parties agree that the down-payment will be counted as part of the price if the sale is completed, and that the vendor will keep the down-payment if the purchaser changes his mind.

661,2150,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2150,Ruling on auctions,"Question

What is the ruling on going to auctions where one has to pay a fee or deposit before entering? What is the ruling on the kind of auctions known nowadays where a product is sold for the highest price reached?",,"Praise be to Allah.Sales and purchases made at auctions are valid transactions, so long as the conditions stipulated by sharee’ah are adhered to. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and one of the texts which they quote as evidence is the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sold a rug (for spreading on the ground or putting on the back of a riding-beast) and a cup. He said, “Who will buy this rug and cup?” A man said, “I’ll take them for a dirham,” and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Who will offer more than a dirham? Who will offer more than a dirham?” Another man gave him two dirhams, and bought the goods. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, may Allah have mercy on, in al-Sunan, 1139; he said, “This is a hasan hadith which we know only from the hadith of al-Akhdar ibn ‘Ajlaan…) The practical conclusion drawn from this by the scholars is that they see nothing wrong with selling war-booty or inherited goods to the highest bidder. This hadith was narrated by al-Mu’tamir ibn Sulaymaan and by more than one of the prominent people from al-Akhdar ibn ‘Ajlaan.
There follows a definition of this kind of sale, and some of the regulations that apply to it:


The contract: an auction is a commutative contract or exchange, based on a call issued vocally or in writing to invite interested parties to take part in the auction. The contract is concluded when the seller is satisfied.


The actual contract may vary according to whether it is the matter of selling or leasing, etc, and according to the nature of the auction – it may be voluntary, like the regular kind of auction held among individuals, or required by law, such as auctions ordered by a judge. Auctions required by law may be held by public and private institutions, and government bodies, as well as individuals.


Any procedures involved in the auction – such as paperwork, regulations and administrative and legal conditions – should not contradict the rules of Islamic sharee’ah.


Requiring a deposit from everyone who wants to come in is permissible according to sharee’ah, but it should be returned to anyone who does not buy anything, and should be counted as part of the purchase price for those who do buy.


According to sharee’ah, there is nothing wrong with charging an entry fee to cover the costs of producing booklets listing regulations, etc., so long as it is not more than the actual cost.


Artificially inflating prices is haraam. This may take the following forms:



a person who has no intention of buying may inflate the price to tempt the buyer to offer more

a person who has no intention of buying may pretend to like the product and to know a lot about it, and may praise it highly, to tempt the buyer to offer more


the vendor, his agent or the auctioneer may make false claims about how much was paid for the product, in order to mislead the one who is thinking of buying


modern forms of this forbidden inflation of prices include the use of audio-visual and written means to list fine qualities that do not exist in reality, or to raise the price so as to tempt the buyer and impel him to complete the transaction

662,2151,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2151,"Secrets in the
    medical profession","Question

                What is a secret? And what are the
      rulings governing secrets in a specific profession dealing with secret or confidential
      issues, such as medicine?",,"Praise be to Allah.A secret is something which one person discloses to another and asks him
        not to tell anyone else. This includes situations where it is obvious that the matter
        should not be disclosed, such as when a man looks around to make sure that there is nobody
        listening to what he is saying, and so on, as well as private and embarrassing matters
        that no-one would like everyone to know about.

A secret is a trust for which the person who has been asked to keep it
        is responsible. This is in accordance with both the teachings of Islam and the
        requirements of chivalry and good manners.

In general, secrets should not be disclosed and spreading secrets
        without a good reason is considered to be subject to the disapproval of sharee’ah.

The duty to keep secrets applies even more to people working in
        professions where disclosure of secrets could reflect badly on the profession itself, as
        is the case in the medical profession, where people come to practitioners to seek advice
        and ask for help, and so they have to tell them everything that may help them to do their
        job properly, including matters which they may not disclose to anyone else, even their
        closest family members.

The obligation to keep secrets does not apply in cases where concealing
        something may lead to a greater harm that outweighs any harm feared as a result of
        revealing it. Such situations are of two types:

Cases where a secret has to be revealed on the grounds of choosing the
          lesser of two evils in order to avoid greater harm, and allowing harm to befall an
          individual for the sake of the general good. Such cases are of two types: 

Where the good of an entire society is at stake 

Where the good of an individual is at stake

Cases where it is permissible to reveal a secret because

This is in the interests of society as a whole

This will protect society from harm

In all these situations, strict attention must be paid to the aims and
    priorities of sharee’ah, which are to protect Islam, lives, minds, lineages and
    wealth."

In some fields of medicine there is a trend towards using aborted foetuses for organ transplants. What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.Nowadays there is something known as the trade in foetuses, in which some doctors deliberately abort foetuses so that they can profit from selling the foetal organs or cells, from which some kinds of injections may be prepared for the benefit of elderly rich people and others. This is a major crime, because it entails the deliberate murder of innocent souls for financial gain. This is a serious form of wrongdoing and the rulings concerning it are well known and obvious. The question of whether the aborted foetus may be used as a source of transplant organs has been researched by the Islamic Fiqh Council, which issued the following fatwaa:


It is not permitted to exploit foetuses as a source of organs needed for transplant into another person except in certain limited circumstances under stringent conditions.




It is not permitted to deliberately induce abortion for the purpose of exploiting the foetus for organ transplants to another person. Only foetuses expelled through natural or spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or aborted for a legitimate reason may be used in this way. Surgery should not be performed to remove the foetus except in cases where the mother’s life is at risk.


If the aborted foetus is viable and capable of living, then medical attention should be aimed at preserving its life, not at exploiting it for organ transplant. If it is not viable and will not live, its organs cannot be used until after it has died naturally, according to the conditions of sharee’ah.




It is not permissible to exploit any part of the procedures required to obtain and transplant organs for commercial gain.


The procedures surrounding organ transplants must be supervised and regulated by a specialized and trustworthy organization.

                What is the ruling on operations that

  men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens 
  (vasectomy) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb (hysterectomy) in women. 
  This is because cutting off all possibility of future offspring with no valid 
  reason is haraam, as it goes against what the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) wanted for his ummah, and is a source of shame and humiliation 
  for the Muslims. The more the Muslims increase in number, the more this is a 
  source of pride and status for them. Allaah has guaranteed to provide for His 
  slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And no living, 
  moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah. And 
  He knows its dweeling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All 
  is in a Clear Book.” [Hood 11:6]. So cutting 
  off all possibility of future offspring for no good reason goes against this 
  teaching. However, if it is necessary to carry out an operation of the kind 
  mentioned – such as a case where the mother’s life will be in danger 
  if she becomes pregnant, or she is suffering from a disease in her womb which 
  it is feared could spread and kill her (such as cancer), so she has no choice 
  but to have her womb removed – then there is nothing wrong with carrying 
  out these operations in such cases of necessity. And Allaah knows best.

    Abu ‘Eesaa (i.e., al-Tirmidhi) said: “This is a ghareeb hadeeth.
    The fact that Faa’id ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan is among the narrators makes the
    hadeeth very weak. Faa’id is Abu’l-Warqaa’.”
Al-Albaani said: “It is very weak indeed.” Al-Haakim said:
    “Fabricated ahaadeeth were narrated from Ibn Abi Awfaa.” (Mishkaat

    the Muslim is faced with distress, he should pray and make du’aa’ in general

“Verily! Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.
They (all those who worship others than Allah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him, and they invoke nothing but Shaytaan, a persistent rebel!

I would like to know whether bleeding invalidates one’s wudu or not.",The basic principle is that bleeding does not break wudu. Bleeding from any part of the body other than the vagina does not invalidate one’s wudu.,"Praise be to Allah.We know of no evidence to indicate that bleeding from any part of the body other than the vagina invalidates one’s wudu . 
The basic principle is that bleeding does not break wudu . Acts of worship should be based on sound reports, so no one is permitted to say that any act of worship is prescribed by Islam unless he has evidence. 
Some scholars suggested that wudu  is broken if the amount of blood lost from any place other than the vagina is considered to be excessive. If a person in this condition does wudu in order to be on the safe side, then this is good. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” (Reported by al-Nasai, 8/328; al-Tirmidhi, 7/221 Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi; al-Hakim, 2/13, 4/99)

A man can hardly go through his day without giving and taking things from his wife. If he has wudoo’ and touches his wife, does this break his wudoo’?",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differ as to whether touching one’s wife directly breaks a man’s wudoo’. The most correct opinion is that it does not break his wudoo’, regardless of whether he touched her with desire or not, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alaah be upon him) kissed some of his wives and did not do wudoo’ after that, and because it would impose a lot of hardship if wudoo’ was required in this case. If it broke a person’s wudoo’, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said so.
With regard to the words of Allaah in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “… or you have been in contact with women…” [al-Nisa’ 4:43; al-Maa’idah 5:6], this refers to sexual intercourse according to the sounder scholarly opinion."
683,2180,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2180,The Muslim’s    reckoning will be much shorter than the kaafir’s,"Question

Will there be any difference in the length of the reckoning of the Muslim and of the kaafir on the Day of Resurrection?",,"Praise be to Allah.Without a doubt, because Allah says about the Day of Resurrection (interpretation of the meaning): “The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Beneficent (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers.” [al-Furqaan 25:26]. The fact that the kaafirs will be singled out for hardship on the Day of Resurrection indicates that it will be easy for the believers.
The words (interpretation of the meaning), “Truly, that Day will be a hard Day, far from easy for the disbelievers.” [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10] also indicate that it will be easy, not difficult, for the believers. This is also indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Hastening towards the caller, the disbelievers will say, ‘This is a hard Day.’” [al-Qamar 54:8]. This means that the Day of Resurrection will be long for the kuffaar and short for the Muslims.
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has mentioned in His Book the length of time the reckoning will take on the Day of Resurrection. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who have earned the Garden [Paradise] on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest” [al-Furqaan 25:24 – Pickthall’s translation]. This aayah indicates that the reckoning will be completed in half a day, because al-maqeel (translated as “noonday rest”) refers to a siesta or rest from the heat of mid-day.
Among those who said that the reckoning will be completed in half a day are Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn Mas’ood, ‘Ikrimah and Ibn Jubayr, because this is what is indicated by this aayah, as was reported by Ibn Katheer and others.
(Daf’ Ayhaam al-Idtiraab by al-Shanqeeti, p. 172).
Another clear indication that the reckoning of the believer on the Day of Resurrection will be easy is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For the believers, the (length of) the Day of Resurrection will be like the time between Zuhr and ‘Asr.”

685,2182,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2182,Ruling on one who neglects prayer,"Question

The saheeh ahaadeeth state clearly that the one who neglects prayer is a kaafir. If we take the hadeeth at face value, it appears that we are obliged to deprive the person who neglects prayer deliberately of all his rights of inheritance, a separate cemetery should be allocated for such people, and we cannot pray for them or greet them with salaam, because there is no greeting of peace for a kaafir. Let us not forget that if we were to calculate the number of men, believers and non-believers alike, who pray, we will find it is only 6%, and among women the number is even less. What does Islam have to say about this? What is the ruling about giving or returning the greeting of salaam to one who neglects prayer?",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars have differed concerning the Muslim who deliberately neglects salaah without denying that it is obligatory. Some of them say that he is definitely a kaafir who has gone beyond the pale of Islam. He is considered to be a murtadd (apostate) who is to be given three days to repent – if he does not, he is to be executed for his apostasy. The funeral prayer will not be recited over him, and he will not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. The greeting of salaam is not to be given to him, in life or in death, and his greeting is not to be returned; prayers for forgiveness and mercy for him cannot be offered; he cannot inherit, neither can his wealth be inherited, instead it is to be given to the Muslim treasury (bayt al-maal). This ruling applies whether the number of people who are neglecting their prayers are many or a few.
This opinion is the soundest and most correct, because of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The difference between us and them is salaah. Whoever neglects it is a kaafir.”
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a saheeh isnaad); and: “(Nothing stands) between a man and kufr and shirk, except prayer: (whoever neglects it becomes a kaafir and a mushrik).” (Reported by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh, with other similar ahaadeeth).
The majority of scholars said that if a person denies that prayer is obligatory, he is a kaafir and an apostate from the religion of Islam. The ruling concerning such a person is as described above. If he does not deny that it is obligatory, but he neglects it because of laziness, for example, then he is guilty of a major sin (kabeerah), but he is not considered to be beyond the pale of Islam. He should be given three days in which to repent. If he does, then al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allaah); if he does not, then he should be executed, but this is a punishment, not because he became a kaafir. In this case, he should be washed (ghusl, after death) and wrapped in a shroud (kafn). The funeral prayer should be offered for him, prayers can be offered for forgiveness and mercy for him, and he should be buried in the Muslim graveyard. He can inherit and be inherited from. In general, all the rules concerning Muslims who are sinners apply to him, in life and in death."

    preferable, but praying it at the time you mention is OK and is still within the right
    time. It is not permissible to delay it until the sun becomes yellow, because of the
    saheeh hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be
    pleased with him) who said: the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: “When you pray Fajr, its time is until the first horn of the sun appears (i.e.,
    until it begins to appear over the horizon). When you pray Zuhr, its time is until
    ‘Asr comes. When you pray ‘Asr, its time is until the sun becomes yellow. When

    to use them to tell the people that the time for prayer has come, or that the time is
    approaching. This is a forbidden innovation (bid’ah), and what is obligatory is to
    let the Adhaan as prescribed in sharee’ah suffice. It was reported that the Prophet
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates anything in
    this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Narrated
    by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
    Al-‘Arbaad ibn Saariyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet

    manner, which made us weep. We said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as if this is a
    farewell, so give us some advice.’ He said, ‘I advise you to fear Allaah and to

    firmly. Beware of newly-innovated things, for every innovation is a going-astray.”
    (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, who said, it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. )
    And we should remember the hadeeth of Abu ‘Umayr ibn Anas from his uncles among the
    Ansaar. He said: the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was
    concerned about how to call the people together to pray. Someone suggested raising a flag
    when the time for prayer came, so that when they saw it they could call one another, but
    he did not like this idea. Someone mentioned a ram’s horn, like the shofar, but he
    did not like this idea, and said, “That belongs to the Jews.” A bell was
    suggested, but he said, “That belongs to the Christians.” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn
    Zayd ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi went away, thinking about this matter that was of concern to
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Then he saw the
    Adhaan in a dream, and he came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) the next day and told him about it. The Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Bilaal, go and see what
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd wants you to do, then do it.” So Bilaal called the Adhaan.
    Reported by Abu Dawood, 420; this is a saheeh hadeeth.
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rejected the ram’s horn
    and the bell, so how can the Muslims accept the drum? Allaah has given them the Adhaan and
    they have no need of anything else.

What is the ruling on non-Muslims entering the mosque?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is forbidden for Muslims to allow any kaafir to enter al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] and the sacred areas [al-Haram] around it, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Verily, the Mushrikûn (polytheists) are Najasun (impure). So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Harâm (at Makkah) after this year” [al-Tawbah 9:28].
With regard to other mosques, some fuqaha’ said that it is permissible because there is nothing to indicate that it is not allowed; others said that it is not permissible, by analogy with al-Masjid al-Haram.
The correct view is that it is permissible if it serves the interests of sharee’ah or meet a valid need, such as a person hearing something that may invite him to enter Islam, or because he needs to drink water in the mosque, or the like. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tied up (his prisoner) Thamaamah ibn Athaal al-Hanafi in the mosque before he became Muslim, and the delegations of Thaqeef and the Christians of Najraan stayed in the mosque before they became Muslim. There were many benefits offered by doing this: they could hear the speeches and sermons of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), see people praying and reciting Qur’aan, and other benefits that are gained by those who visit the mosque. (From Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/276).
If some kuffaar ask to enter the mosque so that they can see how Muslims pray, so long as they have nothing with them that could make the mosque dirty, and there are no women among them who are dressed in a provocative fashion, or any other reason not to let them in, then there is nothing wrong with allowing them to enter and sit behind the Muslims so they can see how they pray. If we fear that there is someone who may rebuke them (for not praying etc.) without realizing that they are not Muslim, we should point this out to them.

Yes, it is permissible to buy it and make it into a mosque, but they have to remove all the crosses and images that are hanging or engraved in it, and everything that indicates that it is a church. We know no reason why this should not be allowed.
From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/267.
Among the evidence that it is permissible to turn the places of worship of shirk and kufr into mosques is the following hadeeth: From Talq ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): “We went out as a delegation to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to him and prayed with him. We told him that in our land we had a place of worship [the word used indicates a Jewish or Christian place of worship], and we asked him to give us some of the water left over from his wudoo’, so he called for water and did wudoo’ and rinsed out his mouth, then he poured that water into a vessel and told us, ‘Go, and when you reach your land, knock down that place of worship and sprinkle this water over the place, then use that place as a mosque.’ We said, ‘Our land is far away and the heat is intense, the water will dry up.’ He said, ‘Add more water to it, it will only increase it in goodness.’ So we set out and when we reached our land, we knocked down our place of worship, sprinkled water on the place and used it as a mosque. We called the adhaan there, and when the monk, a man from Tayyi’, heard it, he said, ‘The call of truth!’ then he climbed one of our hills and we never saw him again.” (Reported by al-Nasaa’i, 694). And Allah knows best.
The building itself does not need to be destroyed so long as its roof, walls etc. can be put to use and architectural alterations can be made, after removing all the symbols of Shirk and other forbidden things, so that the structure of the building will match the rows of prayer, facing the direction of the Ka’bah.

        work
when the light is such that a person cannot do any work that needs light
total darkness.
The question here is: how do we define the beginning of the time for
        Fajr and ‘Isha’ and for starting to fast in the light of the times given by
        these astronomers’ calculations?",,"Praise be to Allah.In defining the times of prayer, the astronomers’ calculations do
    not matter. For determining the time of Fajr, what counts is the appearance of a
    horizontal line of light on the eastern horizon. The time for Fajr starts when this line
    becomes clear and distinct, and it ends when the sun rises. The time for Maghrib starts
    when the disk of the sun has set, and it doesn’t matter if there is still light after
    the disk of the sun has disappeared. The time for ‘Isha’ begins when the red
    afterglow of sunset disappears.
The time for fasting begins when the time for Fajr begins, as we have
    explained above, and the fast ends when the disk of the sun itself has set, even if some
    of its light remains afterwards."
697,2198,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2198,"When
    is it permissible for a woman to uncover her face?","Question

                We know that the most correct opinion
      among the scholars is that women should cover their faces, but there are many situations
      where women cannot cover their faces. Could you shed more light on this topic?",,"Praise be to Allah.The most correct opinion, which is supported by evidence, is that it is
    obligatory to cover the face, therefore young women are forbidden to uncover their faces
    in front of non-mahram men in order to avoid any mischief, and they should certainly do so
    when there is fear of fitnah (temptation). 
On this basis, the fuqaha’ stated that in certain situations,
    women are permitted to uncover their faces in front of non-mahram men when it is necessary
    to do so, and it is permitted for those men to look at them, provided that this do not go
    beyond the bounds of what is necessary, because what is permitted on the grounds of
    necessity should not be exaggerated.
These special situations may be summed up as follows:
I – Proposal of marriage
It is permitted for a woman to uncover her face and hands in front of a
    man who wants to propose to her, so that he may see them, without being alone with her and
    without touching her, because the face gives an indication of ugliness or beauty, and the
    hands give an indication of whether the body is slender or plump (which in turn gives an
    impression about fertility).
Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “The scholars do not differ as
    to the permissibility of looking at the face… the focal point of beauty, the place
    one looks at…”
Many ahaadeeth indicate that it is permissible for a man to look at the
    woman to whom he is proposing marriage. Among them are the following:
Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A woman
        came to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said,
        ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I came to give myself to you in marriage.’ So the
        Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) looked at her, he raised
        his gaze and stared at her, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not
        made any decision, she sat down. Then a man from among his Companions stood up and said,
        ‘O Messenger of Allaah, if you don’t want to marry her, then marry her to
        me.’ …” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7/19; Muslim, 4/143;
        al-Nisaa’i bi Sharh al-Suyooti, 6/113; al-Bayhaqi, 7/84).
      
      
      Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I was with the
        Prophet 
, and a man came to him and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar.
        The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Have you
        looked at her?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and look at her, for there
        is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.’” (Reported by Ahmad, 2/286, 299;
        Muslim, 4/142; al-Nisaa’i, 2/73).
      
      
      Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of
        Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you
        proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead
        and marry her, let him do so.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Haakim. Its
        isnaad is hasan, and there is corroborating evidence in the hadeeth of Muhammad ibn
        Muslimah. It was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. It was also reported by
        Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, and by Ahmad and al-Bazzaar from the hadeeth of Abu Humayd. Fath
        al-Baari, 9/181).
      
    
    Al-Zayla’i said: “It is not permissible for
    him to touch her face or hands – even if he feels that no desire will be aroused by
    doing so – because it is haraam and there is no need to do so.” In Durar
    al-Bihaar it says: “It is not permissible for the qaadi, the witnesses or the
    groom to touch her, even if they feel that no desire will be aroused by doing so, because
    there is no need for that.” (Radd al-Muhtaar ‘ala’l-Durr
    al-Mukhtaar, 5/237).
    Ibn Qudaamah said: “It is not permitted for him to
    be alone with her because she is still forbidden for him, and only a look is permitted,
    therefore being alone with her remains haraam, because there is no guarantee that he will
    not do something haraam if he is alone with her. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a [non-mahram] woman but the Shaytaan
    is the third one present with them.” He should not look at her in a lustful or
    suspicious manner. Ahmad said, according to a report narrated by Saalih: “He should
    look at the face, and he should not look in a lustful manner.”
The man may look at her repeatedly, checking her features, because the
    desired aim cannot be achieved in any other way.”
II – Business dealings
It is permitted for a woman to uncover her face and hands when buying
    or selling, and it is permitted for the vendor to see her face when he hands over the
    goods and asks for the money, provided that this will not lead to fitnah – otherwise
    it is forbidden.
Ibn Qudaamah said: “If a person deals with a woman when selling or
    renting, he may look at her face so he knows who she is, and may go back to her when the
    money is due (a guarantee of the price when the deal is finalized). It was reported that
    Ahmad said this was makrooh in the case of a young woman, but not in the case of an old
    woman, and in the case where there is fear of fitnah, or where there is no need for this
    business deal. But in cases where it is necessary, and there is no wrongful desire, then
    there is no harm in it.” (al-Mughni, 7/459; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala
    Matan al-Muqni’, 7/348 bi Haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a
    Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/24).
    Al-Dasooqi said: “ When testimony is given
    concerning a woman who wears niqaab (face-veil), she has to remove her niqaab. This
    applies in the case of marriage and other matters, such as selling, giving gifts, debts,
    power of attorney, and so on. This is the opinion favoured by our shaykh.” (Haashiyat
    al-Dasooqi ‘ala’l-Sharh al-Kabeer, 4/194).
    III – Medical treatment
A woman is permitted to uncover the site of her illness whether it is
    on her face or elsewhere on her body, for a male doctor to treat her, on the condition
    that her husband or mahram is present, and if she cannot find a female doctor. It is less
    serious for her to be seen by a doctor of the same sex, and she should not be seen by a
    non-Muslim doctor if a Muslim doctor is available. Also, she should not uncover more than
    the site of the problem.
It is not permissible for the doctor to look at or touch more than is
    necessary, because the issue is one of necessity and should not be exaggerated.
Ibn Qudaamah said: “it is permissible for the doctor to look at
    whatever is necessary of her body, of her private parts and elsewhere, because there is a
    need for it to be uncovered.
It was reported that a boy who had stolen something was brought to
    ‘Uthmaan. He said, ‘Look at his groin (to see if he had pubic hair, which would
    indicate whether he had reached the age of puberty [and would therefore be considered to
    be a responsible adult] or not).’ They did not find any pubic hair, so they did not
    cut off his hand.” (Al-Mughni, 7/459; Ghidha’ al-Albaab,
    1/97).
    Ibn ‘Aabideen said: “He said in al-Jawharah:
    if the illness is in any part of her body apart from her private part, it is permitted
    (for the doctor) to look at it in order to treat it, because it is the matter of
    necessity. If the sickness is in her private part, he (the doctor) should teach a woman
    how to treat it. If there is nobody who can do that, and they fear that she may die or
    suffer unbearably, then they should cover all of her body except the site of the sickness,
    then a man may treat her, but he should avoid looking at her as much as he can, and look
    only at the site of the sickness that he is treating.” (Radd al-Muhtaar,
    5/237. See also, al-Hidaayah al-‘Alaa’iyah, p. 245).
    A similar ruling applies to one who is taking care of a
    sick person, even if it is someone of the opposite sex, when helping the patient with
    wudoo’ or istinja’ (washing the private parts after using the toilet). (See
    Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 1/97).
    Muhammad Fu’aad said: “What indicates that it
    is permissible for a man to treat a woman – within the restrictions mentioned above
    – is the report narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari with his isnaad from al-Rabee’
    bint Mu’awwadh, who said: “We used to go out on military campaigns with the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We would bring water to
    the people and serve them, and bring the dead and wounded back to Madeenah.” (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari, 6/80, 10/136. Fath al-Baari. A similar report was narrated from
    Anas by Muslim, 5/196; Abu Dawood, 7/205 ma’a ‘Awn al-Ma’bood;
    and al-Tirmidhi, 5/301-302, who said this is hasan saheeh)
    Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth under the chapter
    heading Baab hal yudaawi’l-rajul ul-mar’ah wa’l-mar’at ul-rajul?
    (Chapter: can a man treat a woman or a woman a man?). (Fath al-Baari,
    10/136).
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The ruling that a man
    may treat a woman was derived from this by analogy; he (al-Bukhaari) did not confirm that,
    because it is possible that this referred to the time before hijaab was made obligatory,
    or that women used to take care of their husbands or mahrams on military campaigns. The
    ruling is that it is permissible for women to treat non-mahram men in cases of necessity,
    with as little looking and touching as possible.” (Fath al-Baari,
    10/136)
    IV – Testimony
It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face when she is giving
    testimony in court, whether she is a witness in a case or is there to witness a deal, and
    it is permissible for the qaadi (judge) to look at her in order to know who she is and to
    protect the rights of all concerned.
Shaykh al-Dardeer said: “It is not permitted to give testimony
    against a woman in niqaab until she uncovers her face so that it may be known who she is
    and what she looks like.” (Al-Sharh al-Kabeer li’l- Shaykh al-Dardeer,
    4/194)
    Ibn Qudaamah said: “The witness may look at the
    face of the woman against whom he is testifying so that his testimony will speak about her
    in specific terms. Ahmad said: ‘He cannot testify against a woman unless he knows who
    she is.’” (Al-Mughni, 7/459; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan
    al-Muqni’, 7/348, bi haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a Takmilat
    Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26).
    V – In court cases
It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of a qaadi
    (judge) who is to rule either in her favour or against her, and in this situation he may
    look at her face in order to know who she is and for the sake of protecting people’s
    rights.
The same rules that apply to giving testimony or bearing witness also
    apply in court cases, because they serve the same purpose. (See Al-Durar
    al-Mukhtaar, 5/237; Al-Hadiyah al-‘Alaa’iyah, p. 244; Al-Hadiyah
    ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26).
    VI – In front of mature boys who feel no physical
    desire
It is permissible – according to one of the two reports – for
    a woman to show in front of a mature boy who feels no physical desire what she shows in
    front of her mahrams, because he has no interest in women, and it is permissible for him
    to see all that. 
Shaykh Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “The mature boy who feels
    no physical desire may see parts of a woman’s body above the navel and below the
    knee, according to one of the two reports, because Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meanings): ‘… there is no sin on you or on them to move about, - attending
    (helping) you each other…’ [al-Noor 24:58] and ‘And when the
    children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those
    senior to them (in age)…’ [al-Noor 24:59]. This indicates that there is a
    differentiation between those who have reached puberty and those who have not.”
Abu ‘Abd-Allaah said: “Abu Tayyibah did cupping for the wives
    of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was a boy.”
It was also reported that he said: “He is like the ajnabi
    (stranger, i.e., non-mahram), because he is like one who has reached puberty in the matter
    of physical desires, and this means that hijaab is required and it is forbidden to look.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… small children who have no
    sense of the shame of sex…’ [al-Noor 24:31]. As for small boys who are not
    mature, it is not necessary to cover in front of them at all.” (Al-Sharh
    al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/349. See also Al-Mughni, 7/458 and
    Ghada’ al-Albaab, 1/97).
    VII – The man who has no desire
It is permissible for a woman to show in front of a man who has no
    desire what she can show in front of her mahrams, because he has no interest in women, and
    he is allowed to see all of that. Ibn Qudaamah said: “Whoever no longer feels any
    desire, because of old age, impotence or incurable illness, or because he is a eunuch,
    … or a mukhannath (the effeminate man or a man who has female hormones) who feels no
    desire, the ruling that applies to such a man is the same as the ruling that applies to
    mahrams regarding looking at women, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘…
    or old male servants who lack vigour…’ [al-Noor 24:31], i.e., those who feel
    no desire for women.” Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “This is the one of whom women do
    not feel shy.” He also said: “This is the mukhannath who is impotent (i.e.,
    cannot have an erection).”
It was reported that Mujaahid and Qutaadah said: “This is the one
    who has no interest in women, but if he is a mukhannath who feels desire and knows about
    women, then the rules that apply to others apply also to him, because ‘Aa’ishah
    said: ‘A mukhannath entered upon the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), and they used to think that he was a man who felt no physical
    desires, but the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon us when
    this man was describing a woman and saying ‘When she comes in, she comes on four, and
    when she goes out, she goes on eight.’ The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: ‘Do I not see that this man knows who is here? This one should never
    enter upon you.’ And he was kept away after that.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and
    others). 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “The mukhannath is not only the one
    who is known to be promiscuous. The mukhannath is the one who looks so much like a woman
    physically that he resembles women in his softness, speech, appearance, accent and
    thinking. If he is like this, he would have no desire for women and he would not notice
    anything about them. This is one of those who have no interest in women who were permitted
    to enter upon women. Do you not see that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) did not prevent that mukhannath from entering upon his wives at first, but when
    he heard him describing the daughter of Ghaylaan and realized that he knew about women, he
    commanded that he should be kept away.” (Al-Mughni, 7/463; al-Sharh
    al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/347-348).
    IX – Old women who are past marriageable age
Old women who are past marriageable age may uncover their faces and
    what usually appears in front of non-mahram men, but it is still better for them to remain
    covered.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women
    past child-bearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their
    (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e., not
    to discard their outer clothing) is better for them…” [al-Noor 24:60]. Ibn
    Qudaamah said: “In the case of old women who are past marriageable age, there is
    nothing wrong if they show what ordinarily appears, because Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning), ‘And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect
    wedlock…’ [al-Noor 24:60].” Ibn ‘Abbaas said concerning the aayahs
    (interpretation of the meanings), “Tell the believing men to lower their
    gaze…” [al-Noor 24:30] and “Tell the believing women to lower their
    gaze…” [al-Noor 24:31]: “Old women who no longer expect to get married
    were exempted from this. The same exemption also applied to women who are deformed and are
    not desirable.” (Al-Mughni, 7/463; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala
    Matan al-Muqni’, 7/347-348).
    X – Uncovering the face in front of kaafir women
The scholars have differed concerning how a Muslim woman should appear
    in front of kaafir women.
Ibn Qudaamah said: “The ruling concerning women dealing with women
    is the same as that concerning men dealing with men. There is no difference between
    Muslims, and no difference between a Muslim woman and a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under
    Muslim rule) woman, just as there is no difference between two Muslim men or between a
    Muslim man and a dhimmi man when it comes to seeing. Ahmad said: ‘Some people think
    that she should not take off her head covering in front of a Jewish or Christian woman.
    However, I think that she (a Jewish or Christian woman) should not see the private part
    (of a Muslim woman), or attend her when she gives birth (i.e., she should not be her
    midwife, because she will look at the most private part of her body when she gives birth
    – except in cases of necessity, as discussed above).’”
Another opinion was reported from Ahmad, according to which a Muslim
    woman should not remove her niqaab in front of a dhimmi woman, because Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “… or their women …” [al-Noor
    24:31]. But the first opinion is more correct, because kaafir women, Jewish and
    others, used to enter upon the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him), and they did not wear hijaab in front of them nor were they commanded to do so.
    ‘Aa’ishah said that a Jewish woman used to come and talk to her, saying
    “May Allaah save you from the punishment of the grave,” and she
    [‘Aa’ishah] asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him)… Asma’ said, “My mother came to me, and she had no desire to
    become Muslim. I asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him), ‘Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?’ and he said,
    ‘Yes.’”
Moreover, hijaab between men and women serves a purpose that is not an
    issue in the case of a Muslim woman and a dhimmi woman, just as it is not an issue in the
    case of a Muslim man and a dhimmi man. Hijaab is obligatory when there is a text stating
    that it is so or the obligation may be understood by analogy; in the case of a Muslim
    woman and a non-Muslim woman, there is neither text nor analogy.
The aayah “… or their women …” [al-Noor 24:31]
    could refer to all women. (Al-Mughni, 7/464; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala
    Matan al-Muqni’, 7/351 bi haamish al-Mughni).
    Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki said: “The correct
    view, in my opinion, is that this permissible in the case of all women, and that it
    appears with the pronoun ( -hinna = their) to match the rest of the aayah. This is
    the aayah of pronouns, where the pronoun -hinna appears twenty-five times; there is
    nothing else like it in the Qur’aan. So this word matches the others.” (Ahkaam
    al-Qur’aan, 3/326).
    Al-Aloosi said: “Al-Fakhr al-Raazi suggested that
    the dhimmi woman is like the Muslim woman, and he said: “The correct opinion is that
    she (the dhimmi woman) is like the Muslim woman, and ‘their women’ means
    all women. The opinion of the salaf (early generations of Islam) should be understood on
    the basis that (covering in front of non-Muslim women) is preferable, but it is not
    obligatory.” Then he said: “This view is easier for people today, for Muslim
    woman can hardly observe hijaab in front of dhimmi women.” (Tafseer
    al-Aloosi, 19/143).
    Muhammad Fu’aad said: “If this opinion was
    easier in their time, then no doubt it is more appropriate and easier in our own time,
    especially for those women who, because of circumstances beyond their control, find that
    they have to live in non-Muslim countries, where they mix with non-Muslim women and their
    lives are interwoven with theirs, to the extent that observing hijaab in front of them is
    fraught with difficulties. Truly, to Allaah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall
    return.”
XI – Hajj and ‘Umrah
Women must uncover their faces and hands when they enter ihraam for
    Hajj or ‘Umrah. At this time, they are forbidden to wear niqaab and gloves, because
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman
    who is in ihraam must not wear niqaab or gloves.”
If a woman needs to cover her face because men are passing close by
    her, or she is beautiful and is sure that men are looking at her, she should drop a part
    of head covering over her face, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah in which she
    said, “Riders were passing by us, and we were in ihraam with the Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when they came near, each of us would
    lower her jilbaab over her face, and when they went away we would uncover our faces
    again.”
Al-Juzayri said, reporting from them: “A woman may cover her face
    for a necessary reason, such as non-mahram men passing close by her, and the fact that
    (the cloth) will touch her face does not matter. This is to make it easy and alleviate
    hardship.” (Al-Fiqh ‘ala’l-Madhaahib al-Arba’ah, 1/645).
    These are situations in which it is acceptable for a
    woman to uncover her face and hands, explained in detail by the fuqaha’ and scholars.
    But there is one other situation which deserves our attention, and that is when a Muslim
    woman is forced to uncover her face – what is the ruling in this case?
XII – Compulsion
Some oppressive regimes have instituted harsh laws which go against the
    religion of Islam and rebel against Allaah and His Messenger. These laws prevent Muslim
    women from wearing proper hijaab, and some of them even remove their niqaab by force and
    subject them to the worst type of oppression and persecution.
Women who wear niqaab have been subjected to harassment in certain
    European countries, where they have been subjected to harm, and Islam and the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have been slandered. 
Therefore, when a woman is certain that she is likely to be subjected
    to unbearable harassment, she is permitted to uncover her face. It is better to follow a
    scholarly opinion which is less correct than to expose herself to trouble at the hands of
    evil men.
If a woman is permitted to uncover her face and hands in the situations
    described above, which do not involve force or harassment, then surely it is more likely
    that she is permitted to uncover them when she is faced with a threat to herself and her
    religion, especially when her niqaab may expose her to tormentors who may pull the hijaab
    from her head or subject her to worse abuse. In cases of necessity, things that are
    ordinarily forbidden are permitted, within the limits of what is strictly necessary, as
    the scholars have stated, but this should not lead one to take the matter of covering the
    face lightly. Each woman must evaluate the situation in which she is living and learn from
    her own experience and that of others, so that she will be sure of what is a case of real
    necessity, as opposed to her own whims and weaknesses.
Although women are permitted to uncover their faces and hands in the
    exceptional situations described above, they are not permitted to wear make-up and visible
    jewellery if they do so. It is forbidden for them to display these things in front of
    non-mahram men, according to all the fuqaha’, because Allaah says (interpretation of

                In reply to a question regarding marriage
      of prophet Mohammad (
), I was given to understand that prophet Mohammad had a dream in
      which he saw that he got married with hazrat Aisah who was only 6-7 year old at that time.
      Consequently, he discussed this with hazrat Aisha. In other word this marriage was
      arranged by Allah himself. If so, we have a logical answer to satisfy critics that it was
      ordered by Allah. However, in support of that there must be an athentic hadith or a verse
      in the Qur'an.I will appreciate if you can provide me info regarding this issue.",,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth to which you refer was reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Aaishah (may Allaah be
    pleased with her), who said that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said to her: You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw you in a piece of silk
    (i.e., he saw her image on a piece of silk, or he saw her wearing a silken garment). I was
    told, This is your wife, so unveil her, and it was you. I said: if this dream
    is from Allaah then it will come to pass. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari,
    3606).
    In his commentary on this hadeeth, Ibn Hajar (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) said: This dream came after his mission had started, and it was a
    wahy (revelation) that had implications in real life. (Its implication was that he did
    indeed marry her later on). His words and it was you indicate that he had seen
    her before and knew what she looked like. (See Fath al-Baari)
There is nothing in the hadeeth to indicate that his marriage to
    Aaishah was as a result of that dream. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) asked her father for her hand in marriage, and her father Abu Bakr
    gave her in marriage, in the usual fashion, as is indicated in the following hadeeth:
 Urwah reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) asked Abu Bakr for Aaishahs hand in marriage, and
    Abu Bakr said to him: But I am your brother. He said: You are my brother
    according to the religion and Book of Allaah (i.e., my brother in Islam), and she is
    permissible for me (to marry). (Bukhaari, 4691).
In his commentary Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
    Ibn Abi Aasim reported via Yahyaa ibn Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Haatib from
    Aaishah that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent
    Khawlah bint Hakeem to Abu Bakr to ask for Aaishahs hand in marriage.
    Abu Bakr asked her, Is she right for him? Because she is the daughter of my
    brother. Khawlah went back and mentioned this to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him). He told her: Go back and tell him: You are my brother
    in Islam, and your daughter is right for me. She went back to Abu Bakr and
    told him, and he said: Call the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him). So he came and the marriage was performed.
The phrase You are my brother according to the religion and Book
    of Allaah (i.e., my brother in Islam) was referring to the aayah (interpretation of
    the meaning): The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic
    religion) [al-Hujuraat 49:10] and other similar aayaat. The phrase
    she is permissible for me (to marry) means it is permissible to marry her even
    though she is the brothers daughter, because the kind of brotherhood that would
    prevent such a marriage is the brotherhood of descent (same parent) or of radaaah
    (by being breastfed in infancy by the same woman), not the brotherhood of faith.
As regards the woman to whom the Prophets marriage was arranged
    in heaven, as it were, by Allaah, and not in the customary fashion, this was Zaynab bint
    Jahsh (may Allaah be pleased with her), as is indicated by the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah
    be pleased with him), who said: Zaynab used to boast (to her co-wives) about how she
    had got married to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), saying:
    Your families arranged your marriages but Allaah arranged my marriage from above the
    seven heavens. (al-Bukhaari, 6870). No other wife except Zaynab was married to
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in such a unique fashion;
    Aaishahs marriage was arranged as described in the reports quoted above.

701,2209,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2209,Is saying “Sadaqa Allaahu al-‘Azeem ”    after reciting from Qur’an bid’ah?,"Question

Is saying Sadaqaallahu Al Azim after reciting or quoting from the Qur'an an innovation, and if it is, how was it introduced?",,"Praise be to Allah.Many people have the habit of ending a recitation from the Quraan with the words Sadaqa Allaahu al-Azeem (Almighty Allaah has spoken the truth), but this has no basis in Islam because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do it, nor was it the custom of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and it was unknown among the Taabieen (the generation after the Sahaabah). This custom arose in later times because some reciters would say these words, on the basis of the aayah: Say: Allaah has spoken the truth [Aal Imraan 3:95 interpretation of the meaning], and people liked this. But this istihsaan (being liked) should be rejected, because if this was really something good, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the Sahaabah and the Taabieen the salaf or first and best generations of the ummah would not have neglected to do it.
The aayah Say: Allaah has spoken the truth (Aal Imraan 3:95 interpretation of the meaning) does not mean that these words should be said at the end of any reading or recitation. If that were the case, He would have said, When you finish reading, say Allaah has spoken the truth, just as He said (interpretation of the meaning): So when you want to recite the Quraan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one). [al-Nahl 16:98]
The aayah which the innovators use to support their practice of saying Sadaqa Allaah after reciting Quraan was actually revealed in the context of confirming what was said about how all food had been lawful to Bani Israeel except what Israeel had made unlawful for himself. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): Bring here the Tawraat (Torah) and recite it, if you are truthful. Then, after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allaah, such shall indeed be the zaalimoon (disbelievers). Say (O Muhammad), Allaah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibraaheem (Islamic monotheism, i.e., he used to worship Allaah alone), and he was not of al-mushrikeen (polytheists). [Aal Imraan 3:93-95]
If this aayah meant that these words should be said after reciting from the Quraan, the first one to know and do this would have been the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Because this is not the case, we know that this is not what was meant.
In conclusion, therefore, saying Sadaqa Allaahu al-Azeem after reciting Quraan is an innovation, and the Muslim should not say it.
But believing that Allaah has spoken the truth is obligatory, and whoever disbelieves or doubts the truth of what Allaah has said is a kaafir who is outside of the pale of Islam. We seek refuge with Allaah from that.
If a person says Allaah has spoken the truth on certain occasions, such as when something He has foretold comes to pass, affirming the truth of what He has said, then this is permissible, because something similar has been reported in the Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was giving a speech, and al-Hasan and al-Husayn came along, so he came down from the minbar, picked them up and put them in from of him, then he said: Indeed Allaah has spoken the truth: Your wealth and your children are only a trial [al-Taghaabun 64:15 interpretation of the meaning]."

    be thinking of your future, for this will lead you to take decisive action from now. If
    you know for sure that you can avoid selling everything that is forbidden in sharee'ah,
    then there is nothing wrong with continuing your studies. But if you know that you will
    not be able to avoid it, or you believe it is more likely that you will be too weak to
    avoid it, then you should change to another specialty from now, so that you will be able
    to practice a profession that will be acceptable to Allaah. Alternatively, if you see that
    there are impediments to practicing your specialty due to the involvement of forbidden
    items, you could take the initiative and commitment to finding permissible alternatives,
    whether natural or synthetic, to the forbidden items. The important thing is to ensure you
    will not put yourself in a position where you are involved in the sale, receiving, or
    giving of items that are haraam. 
Some of the issues having to do with medicine need to be
    contemplated; for example, if a medicine contains alcohol and would intoxicate a person if
    a large amount was drunk (i.e. of the medicine itself), then it is haraam; otherwise it is
    not haraam. Similarly there are questions surrounding the impurities that form the
    ingredients of some medicines: is the structure of the impure substance changed in
    totality when it is mixed with the other ingredients, or does it remain the same? Surely
    you are not unaware that there are medicines taken from the urine of pregnant women, or
    blood, or from body parts removed from humans, such as placentas, to which the rulings
    concerning dead meat apply. The rulings governing all of these things need to be
    investigated, and consequently the rulings regarding their sale; the matter needs to be
    studied both from the point of view of Islamic Sharee'ah and of chemical analysis.

How do I pray salat al istikharah, and at what times? Are there special du’as that I can read for different circumstances?","This is how to pray istikharah:
1.	Make wudu (ablution)
2.	Offer two rak’ahs of sunnah prayer
3.	Make the du’a mentioned in the detailed answer below.","Praise be to Allah.How to pray Istikharah
The description of Salat al-Istikharah (istikharah prayer) was reported by Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Salami (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make istikharah in all things, just as he used to teach them surahs from the Quran. He said: If any one of you is concerned about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: Allahumma inni astakheeruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa asaluka min fadlika, fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa anta ‘allam al-ghuyoob. Allahumma fa in kunta ta'lamu hadhal-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) khayran li fi ‘ajil amri wa ajilihi (or: fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri) faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li thumma barik li fihi. Allahumma wa in kunta ta'lamu annahu sharrun li fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri (or: fi ‘ajili amri wa ajilihi) fasrifni ‘anhu [wasrifhu ‘anni] waqdur li al-khayr haythu kana thumma raddini bihi (O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and my affairs ), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it.
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 6841; similar reports are also recorded by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Ahmad)
Commentary on the hadith of istikharah
Ibn Hajr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadith:
“Istikharah is a word which means asking Allah to help one make a choice, meaning choosing the best of two things where one needs to choose one of them.
Concerning the phrase The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to make istikharah in all things, Ibn Abi Jamrah said: It is a general phrase which refers to something specific. With regard to matters that are wajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (liked or encouraged), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to do them, and with regard to matters that are haram (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to avoid them. The issue of istikharah is confined to matters that are mubah (allowed), or in mustahabb matters when there is a decision to be made as to which one should be given priority. I say: it refers to both great and small matters, and probably an insignificant issue could form the groundwork for a big issue.
The phrase If any one of you is concerned appears in the version narrated by Ibn Mas’ud as: if any one of you wants to do something
Let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer. This is mentioned to make it clear that it does not mean Fajr prayer, for example. Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar: He can pray istikarah after two rak’ahs of regular sunnah prayer done at zhuhr for example, or after two rak’ahs of any nafl prayers whether they are regularly performed or not It seems to be the case that if he made the intention to pray istikharah at the same time as intending to pray that particular prayer, this is fine, but not if he did not have this intention.
Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The wisdom behind putting the salat before the du’a is that istikharah is intended to combine the goodness of this world with the goodness of the next. A person needs to knock at the door of the King (Allah), and there is nothing more effective for this than prayer, because it contains glorification and praise of Allah, and expresses one's need for Him at all times.
The phrase then let him say would seem to imply that the du’a should be said after finishing the prayer, and the word thumma (then) probably means after reciting all the words of the salat and before saying salam.
The phrase O Allah, I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your knowledge is explaining because You know best. Similarly, by virtue of Your power most likely means seeking Your help. I seek ability (astaqdiruka) means I ask You to give me the power or ability (qudrah) to do whatever is being asked for, or it probably means I ask You to decree (tuqaddir) this for me. So it may mean making it easy.
I ask You of Your great bounty refers to the fact that Allah gives out of His great generosity, but no one has the right to His blessings. This is the opinion of Ahl al-Sunnah.
You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not refers to the fact that power and knowledge belong to Allah alone, and the slave has no share of them except what Allah decrees for him.
O Allah, if in Your knowledge this matter, according to one report, he should mention it by name. It is apparent from the context that he should state it, but it is probably sufficient to be thinking of the matter whilst making this du’a.
Then ordain it for me means make it happen for me or it may mean make it easy for me.
Then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it means so that my heart will no longer feel attached to it after it has been turned away.
Make me pleased with it means make me content with it, so that I will never regret asking for it or be sorry that it happened, because I do not know how it will turn out, even if at the time of asking I am pleased with it.
The secret is that one’s heart should not be attached to the matter in question, because that will result in a person becoming restless. Being pleased with something means that one’s heart is content with the decree of Allah.” (Summarized from the commentary of al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) on the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Da’wat and Kitab al-Tawheed.)

      that he will be called to account for it before Allah. His wife will not willingly
      relinquish her rights as she wants him to return to her, nor will she accept a second
      marriage... Is it halal for him to tell her that he will retain her as a wife only under
      the condition that she relinquish her rights to his time to a second wife? He does not
      want to oppress himself nor does he want to oppress her.. what are his options?",,"Praise be to Allah.If he has no interest in his present wife, there is nothing wrong with
    divorcing her and marrying another, but if he and she come to an agreement whereby she may
    remain his wife for the sake of the children, there is nothing wrong with this either. If
    he gives her the choice between divorce and giving up her rights to his time and his
    spending on her, in whole or in part, this is not oppression. Oppression is when he keeps
    her by force without giving her any of her rights whilst at the same time refusing to give
    her a divorce.
The evidence (daleel) that the situation described above is
    permissible is to be found in the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from
    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), which comments on the aayah
    (interpretation of the meaning): “And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her
    husband’s part…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. She said: “This
    was a woman who was married to a man who did not care for her, so he wanted to divorce her
    and marry someone else. (According to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari she said: He
    was a man who saw something he disliked in his wife, so he wanted to divorce her.) She
    said to him: ‘Keep me, do not divorce me. Marry someone else and I will absolve you
    of your obligation to spend on me and share your time with me.’ This is what Allaah
    referred to when He revealed the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘…
    there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making
    peace is better…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128].” (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 4807)
    “This was a woman who was married to a man who did not
    care for her” means that he did not love her or want to treat her well or stay with
    her. “I will absolve you of your obligation towards me” means: leave me without
    divorcing me. Concerning this issue, Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the
    meaning): “And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s
    part…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. ‘Ali reported that this was
    revealed concerning a woman who is married to a man and does not want to leave him, so
    they come to an agreement that he will visit her every three or four days.” 
Al-Tirmidhi reported via Sammaak from ‘Ikrimah from Ibn ‘Abbaas
    that he said: “Sawdah was afraid that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said: ‘O Messenger of
    Allaah, do not divorce me; give my day to ‘Aa’ishah.’ So he did so. Then
    this aayah was revealed.” Al-Tirmidhi said: “(This is) hasan ghareeb.”
    I say: there is corroborating evidence in a hadeeth from ‘Aa’ishah narrated by
    al-Bukhaari and Muslim, without referring to the revelation of the aayah. (From Fath
    al-Baari).
The hadeeth mentioned by al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him)
    is in Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2966, where it is reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas said:
    “Sawdah was afraid that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    would divorce her, so she said: ‘Do not divorce me. Keep me and give my day to
    ‘Aa’ishah.’ So he did so, then Allaah revealed the aayah: ‘…
    there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making
    peace is better…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. So whatever they agreed upon was
    permissible.” It is as if the last sentence was the comment of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Abu
    ‘Iesa said: this is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth.
Al-Mubaarakpoori said, commenting on this hadeeth:
‘Sawdah was afraid…’ This refers to Sawdah bint Zam’ah
    ibn Qays al-Qurashiyyah al-‘Aamiriyyah. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her in Makkah after Khadeejah had died, and
    consummated the marriage there. The scholars agree that he consummated his marriage to her
    before he consummated his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah, and she migrated to Madeenah
    with him. She died at the end of the khilaafah of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab.
‘…was afraid that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said…’ Al-Bukhaari and Muslim
    reported from ‘Aa’ishah that Sawdah bint Zam’ah gave her day to
    ‘Aa’ishah, so the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used
    to give ‘Aa’ishah her own day and that of Sawdah. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath:
    Abu Dawood reported this hadeeth (from ‘Aa’ishah): ‘The Messenger of Allaah
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never used to prefer any of us over
    others in sharing his time (i.e., he was fair in dividing his nights among his wives, and
    each one of them had her allotted night). When Sawdah bint Zam’ah grew old and feared
    that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might
    divorce her, she said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, my day is for
    ‘Aa’ishah,’ and he accepted this from her. Then concerning this and similar
    cases, the aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And if a woman fears
    cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. These
    reports agree that she feared divorce and so gave her day to ‘Aa’ishah.
Then al-‘Allaamah al-Mubaraakpoori said: The aayah may be explained
    thus: ‘If a woman fears’ means if she expects. ‘Cruelty’ means
    that he spurns her by refusing to sleep with her or by spending less on her than he
    should, because he dislikes her and wants to marry someone more beautiful. ‘Desertion’
    means that he turns his face away from her. ‘There is no sin on them both if they
    make terms of peace between themselves’ means with regard to the sharing of his
    time and his spending on her, i.e., he should still give her something in this regard
    (sharing time or spending) in order to preserve the relationship: if she accepts, this is
    OK, otherwise the husband must either give her her full rights or divorce her. ‘Making
    peace is better’ means better than separation, cruelty and desertion. Whatever
    they agree upon between themselves is permissible.

                In Islamic Marriages, what symbols are used
      from the engagement period to the celebrations?
  And what is the significance of the rituals involved from engagement to
      celebration?",,"Praise be to Allah.The relationship of an engaged man with his fiancée is the same as a
    man’s relationship with any woman to whom he is not related: he is not allowed to
    enjoy any kind of physical relationship with her whatsoever, until the marriage contract

If it is asked what kind of relationship the husband can have with his
    wife after the contract has been completed and before the wedding party, the answer is
    that he may enjoy a full husband-wife relationship, including looking at her, kissing her,
    being alone with her, travelling with her, having intercourse with her, etc. (al-Lajnah

                Asalamualaikum,
 My 17 year old son passed away last month. I would like to say some doas
  and prayers for him but do not know how. Do I say the doa in my daily prayers or just read
  the Quran as a gift for him? What I mean is how can I help him as a mother? My father also
  passed away quite some time now and what do I do to help him. I am so ignorant on this. I
  read that a child's prayer for his parents is good but what of a mother to the deceased
  child especially one who is not married and with no children to doa for him. 
Please enlighten me on this. Thank
  you and wassalam.",,"Praise be to Allah.How can your duaa (prayer, 
  supplication) not be answered and not be of benefit to your son, when the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has 
  said: There are three duaas which will undoubtedly 
  be answered: the duaa of one who is oppressed, the duaa 
  of a traveller, and the duaa of a parent for his child? 
  (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 3852; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 
  no. 3033). The word parent [waalid, lit. father] includes both 
  father and mother. You are his mother, who bore him, nursed him, fed him and 
  brought him up. You are more compassionate towards him than all his other relatives, 
  and you are the one who has suffered the most grief and distress because of 
  his loss. Pray for him for forgiveness, mercy, Paradise and salvation from the 
  Fire. Pray for him in your salaat and your sujood (prostration), in the last 
  third of the night and on Fridays before sunset, and at all other times and 
  in all other circumstances. 
Be of good cheer and remember the great reward which will be 
  yours if you bear this loss with patience, accept the will and decree of Allaah, 
  and hope for reward. You have lost your child to One Who is more compassionate 
  towards him than you, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, Allaah, the 
  Lord of the Worlds. You also have the consolation of knowing that if you and 
  he die believing in Tawheed and in Islam, you will be reunited after death. 
  The righteous will be reunited with their offspring in Paradise, even if they 
  are of a lesser status than them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
  And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, - 
  to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward 
  of their deeds in anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned. 
  [al-Toor 52:21]
As regards your question about what you can do for your father 
  and your son who have passed away, you will find a detailed and comprehensive 
  answer under # 763, which describes things which 
  the living can do for the benefit of the dead.
Finally, we console you with the words with which the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) consoled 
  a mother whose son had died:
To Allaah belongs whatever He takes and whatever He gives. Everything 
  has an appointed time with Him. Have patience and hope of a reward from Him.

Is it permissible for women to pray the friday Zuhr prayer in the mosque that is only two rakat . When i was a child Iwas told that two rakat of Zuhr prayer on friday is only for men and women are supposed to pray on friday as any other day . Please guide me .",,"Praise be to Allah.Women do not have to pray Salaat al-Jumu’ah (Friday prayer). Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “As regards women, there is no difference (among the scholars) concerning the fact that Jumu’ah is not obligatory for them.”
(Al-Mughni ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 2/151). But if a woman prays Jumu’ah in the mosque, then she should pray two rak’ahs, just like the men. Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Jumu’ah is not obligatory for one who is weak because of sickness or who has another valid excuse, or for women, but if any of these people attend Jumu’ah, they should pray two rak’ahs.” (al-Muhallaa, 5/81). So if a woman goes to the mosque and prays Jumu’ah, this is good enough, and she does not have to pray Zuhr too. And Allah knows best."
709,2237,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2237,Reading Soorat Yaa-Seen in congregation on Friday nights,"Question

Is it forbidden in Islam to read the Sura Yaseen on Friday nights in a congregational manner in the mosque?",,"Praise be to Allah.Reading the Quran brings a great reward. Allah will multiply the reward for every letter of every aayah in any soorah that is read, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one letter of the Book of Allah will have one hasanah (reward) for doing so, and every hasanah will be multiplied by 10. I do not say that ‘Alif, laam, meem’ is one letter, but ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘laam’ is a letter and ‘meem’ is a letter.’”
(Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 2835).
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “Read the Quran, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions (i.e., those who read it)…”
(Reported by Muslim, 1337)
This reward will only be for the one who reads it sincerely, following the Sunnah. But the one who innovates in his readings (whether it be in the way he reads, the position he adopts when reading, the number of times he reads or the times when he reads) will not earn the reward, rather his deeds will be rejected and thrown back at him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim, 3242). According to another report, he said: “Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours, will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim, 3243)
Because a specific time – Friday night – is being allocated and the reading is being done in congregation although no saheeh evidence to that effect has been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this action is bid’ah and is not prescribed or allowed by sharee’ah. It should therefore be avoided. We ask Allah to guide us all to the truth and help us to follow the Sunnah. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

I have been practicing Islam for some time now and I am still in the process of learning. A Muslim friend of mine gave me a book on Duas and in this book the author tells you exactly which surahs and du’as to say after each prayer. 
The problem I have is that some of the surahs which he mentions, I never heard of before and I think that maybe they have other names. There are also verses from the Quran that have to be said but are in Arabic.
I hope that you will be able to help me as I am anxious to know exactly what surahs and du’as they are:
1. Surah ALHAMDU
2. Surah INNA FATAHNA
3. Dalailul Khrirat (one part)
4. ALLAHUS SAMAD (Is this one of Allah's 99 names that has to be recited 500 times or is it a name of a du’a?)
5. Surah AMMA YATASA ALOON
6. Ayat Karimah, i.e. ""Lailaha illa anta Subhanaka inna Kunto minazzalimeen"" 100 times (Please give it to me in English and tell me which surah it's from?)","You should act upon the sound hadiths that describe the virtues of Surat al-Ikhlas. So recite it as many times as you wish, without sticking to a certain number or time or way that is not prescribed by Shari`ah.","Praise be to Allah.Names of some surahs
Firstly, the better-known names and numbers of the surahs about which you ask are as follows:

Surah al-Hamdu is Surat al-Fatihah (the Opening), Surah #1
Surah Inna Fatahna is Surat al-Fath (the Victory), Surah #48
Allahus-Samad is Surat al-Ikhlas (the Purity), Surah #112
'Amma yatasa alun is Surat al-Naba (the Great News), Surah #78

The verse “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (None has the right to be worshipped except You [O Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers) is from Surat al-Anbiya, Surah 21, Verse 87.
Commentary on the Book Dalail al-Khayrat
A word of warning: The book Dalail al-Khayrat contains weak and fabricated hadiths, and prescribes things that are contrary to the truth, so it is not right for anyone to rely on this book.
Does the translation of the Quran count as the Quran itself?
A translation of the Quran in English or any other language is not counted as Quran itself, and the rulings that apply to Quran do not apply to it. The Quran is the Word of Allah which was revealed in the Arabic tongue.
Virtues of Surat al-Ikhlas
Al-Ahad (the One) and al-Samad (the Self-Sufficient) are two of the great Names of Allah .
Stating that Surat al-Ikhlas should be recited 500 times, and that the verse (interpretation of the meaning) La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (None has the right to be worshipped except You [O Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers) [al-Anbiya 21:87] should be recited 100 times is a practice that has no basis whatsoever in the Quran or the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so it is not right to adhere to these numbers. You should act upon the sound hadiths that describe the virtues of this surah and this verse. These reports include the following:
From Qatadah ibn al-Nu'man (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that a man stayed up to worship Allah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just before dawn and recited Qul huwa Allahu ahad, but did not recite anything else. In the morning, the man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about this, thinking that perhaps he was not doing enough. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. (al-Bukhari, 4627).
Ahmad reported from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that a man said, O Messenger of Allah, I have a neighbour who prays at night and he only ever recites Qul huwa Allahu ahad as if he did not think much of this. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. (al-Musnad, 10965)
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his Companions: Could any one of you not recite one third of the Quran in one night? They found the idea too difficult, and said, Who among us could do that, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Allahul-ahad, al- samad [i.e., Surat al-Ikhlas] is one third of the Quran. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4628)
`Aishah reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would cup his hands together, blow into them and recite into them Qul huwa Allahu ahad [Surat al-Ikhlas], Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-falaq [Surat al-Falaq] and Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-nas [Surat al-Nas] (these are the last 3 surahs of the Quran). Then he would wipe as much of his body as he could with his hands, starting with his head and face, and the front of his body. He would do this three times. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4630)
`Aishah also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man in charge of a small military campaign, and when he recited Quran whilst leading his companions in prayer, he would always end with Qul huwa Allahu ahad. When they came back, (his companions) mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who told them to ask him why he did that. So they asked him, and he said, Because it is a description of the Most Merciful, and I love to recite it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Tell him that Allah loves him. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6827)
'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Sabbih isma Rabbik al-A'la (Surat al-A'la, #87), Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun (Surat al-Kafirun, #109) and Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Surat al-Ikhlas, #112) in his witr prayer, and when he had finished, he would repeat Subhan al-Malik al-Quddus (Glory be to the King, the Holy) three times, making the last vowel long on the third recitation. (Reported by al-Nasai, 1721)
'Uqbah ibn 'Amir said: I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said to me, O 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, shall I not teach you some Surahs the like of which have not been revealed in the Tawrat (Torah) or the Zabur (Psalms) or the Injil (Gospel) or in the Quran? There is no night that comes but you should not recite (i.e., every night you should recite) Qul huwa Allahu ahad [Surat al-Ikhlas], Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-falaq [Surat al-Falaq] and Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-nas [Surat al-Nas]. 'Uqbah said: So every night I would recite them. It became my duty to recite them, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded me to do so. (Musnad Ahmad, 16810)
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard a man reciting Qul huwa Allahu ahad, and said, It is his right. They asked, O Messenger of Allah, what is his right? He said, Paradise is his right. (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 7669)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites Qul huwa Allahu ahad ten times, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise. (Sahih al-Jami' al-Saghir, 6472).
So recite it as many times as you wish, without sticking to a certain number or time or way that is not prescribed by Shari`ah.
Virtues of “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin”
With regard to the verse “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin”, the following report has been narrated concerning its virtues:
Sa'd said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The call of Dhul-Nun [Yunus/Jonah], which he recited when he was in the belly of the fish, La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin. There is no Muslim who recites this in any situation, but Allah will respond to him. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3427, and classed as sahih in Sahih al-Jami', 3383).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Shall I not tell you of something which, if some of the misery and distress of this world befalls a man and he recites it, he will be relieved of his stress. It is the du'a of Dhul-Nun: La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin. (Reported by al-Hakim; Sahih al-Jami', 2605).
We ask Allah to help us, you and all our Muslim brothers to gain beneficial knowledge and to do righteous deeds. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

    devastated when this woman left you and went back to her kaafir boyfriend. You need to
    keep matters of belief and religion separate from your emotions and personal desires.
    Adhere to the limits set by Allaah, and follow His rules, one of which is the aayah
    (interpretation of the meaning): Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery
    marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an

    one who fasts and prays and devoutly adheres to the limits set by Allaah. This is the kind
    of woman you should long for, not this impure woman whose interest in Islam was only a
    temporary, emotional affair. I also advise you to adhere to the shareeah when
    calling non-Muslims to Islam, and not to treat the matter of speaking to non-mahram women
    (women to whom you are not related) lightly. You should not start any kind of forbidden
    contact or relationship with them in the name of dawah. The Muslim man should use
    indirect means of communication when calling non-Muslim women to Islam, such as giving
    them books or tapes, or communicating with them via e-mail, etc., within the bounds of
    what is right and proper. We ask Allaah to guide us all and make us content with what is

      doesn't have AOL). Her question is"" Is it Haram to read about bad things? What about
      hearing or reading about bad stories? If it is, then what should I do to recover my bad
      deed?"" Please answer it as soon as possible!",,"Praise be to Allah.One of the aims of shareeah is to protect peoples honour
    and to preserve lineages (keep them legitimate). For this reason, marriage has been
    prescribed, and fornication, adultery, sodomy and lesbianism have been forbidden. All the
    things that may lead to the above have also been forbidden, such as looking at non-mahram
    women (women to whom one is not closely related), mixing with them or being alone with
    them. Dressing improperly and forming friendships with the opposite sex have also been
    forbidden. All of this is aimed at preventing the provocation of desires, and at directing
    desires into legitimate channels instead of letting them find forbidden means of
    expression. One of the principles of shareeah is that whatever leads to haraam deeds
    is itself haraam, so everything that leads to the provocation of haraam desires is haraam,
    because it may lead to a person falling into fornication and adultery. Once desire has
    been provoked, it invariably means that a person has to find a way of satisfying it, and
    so he or she commits a haraam act. Reading stories and magazines with sexual content, and
    looking at dirty pictures and movies provokes these kinds of desires and leads to haraam
    deeds, so they are not allowed. We should avoid them and keep away from them. Warn your
    friend about this and tell her to repent by keeping away from these things and getting rid
    of any bad books, movies etc. that she still has. She should feel remorse for the past,
    and should do more righteous deeds from now on. We ask Allaah to grant us all chastity and
    good health, to purify our hearts and to accept our repentance, for He is the Acceptor of
    repentance, the Most-Merciful."

My questions relate to Bida'a. At the Mosque I attend I see brothers performing actions which I think are Bida'a but require confirmation with sources. I would like to try correct these practices, Inshallah with Hickma, if there are incorrect.
1. Blowing on fingers and wiping eyes with thumbs after making Dua'a.
2. Always ending Dua'a with Al-Fatiha.
3. Kissing the Qu'ran when picking it up and before putting it down.
4. Swaying while sitting in Salat or reading Qu'ran.",,"Praise be to Allah.Any act of worship must be based on evidence (daleel) from the Quraan or saheeh Sunnah. One of the principles of this religion is that Allaah cannot be worshipped except in the ways that He has prescribed, and He cannot be worshipped in innovated ways (bidah). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] that is not part of it, will have it rejected, i.e., his deed will be unacceptable to Allaah. There is no evidence in either the Quraan or Sunnah for ending duaas with al-Faatihah. Similarly, there is no evidence for blowing onto ones fingers and wiping the eyes with them after making duaa. Al-Shuqayri (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned the bidah of kissing the thumbnails and wiping the eyes with them after making duaa following salaah, or bunching the fingertips together and touching them to the eyes after prayer, and reciting certain things whilst doing so; he said that these are silly innovations.
(Al-Sunan wal-Mubtadaaat, p. 71). With regard to the question of kissing the Mus-haf (copy of the Arabic text of the Quraan), the Fatwa Standing Committee (al-Lajnah al-Daaimah lil-Iftaa) answered a question on this matter with the following fatwa: We know of no basis for kissing the Quraan. In another response to a similar question, they said: We know of no evidence that prescribes kissing the Quraan, which was revealed to be recited, respected, understood and acted upon. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, no. 4172)
In Al-Aadaab al-Shariyyah (2/273, Al-Risaalah edition), Ibn Muflih says:
It was reported that he (Imaam Ahmad) did not give an opinion [??] on this matter (kissing the Quraan) and touching it to one's forehead and eyes.
Al-Qaadi said in al-Jaami al-Kabeer: He did not give an opinion on that, although it contains an element of respect and honour, because in the case of deeds intended to draw closer to Allaah, if there is no comparable precedent in the Sunnah, then it is better not to do it. Do you not remember when Umar saw the Black Stone, he said: You cannot do any harm or any good. If it were not for the fact that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed you, I would not kiss you.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1597; Muslim, 1270).
As for swaying when reciting Quraan or praying, this is habit of the Jews in their worship, so the Muslim should not do it deliberately.
(See Bida al-Qurra by Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 57). One of the ways of wisdom (hikmah) in dawah and combatting wrongdoing, to which you refer in your question, is to ask people for the evidence for what they are doing, because it is not permissible to worship in ways for which there is no evidence, as we have pointed out above. The burden of proof rests on the person who is doing the deed, not on the one who is seeking to correct him. May Allaah give us and you the strength to do good. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

    A Muslim cannot inherit from a kaafir, and a kaafir cannot inherit from a
    Muslim, because of the hadeeth reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, in which the Prophet
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not inherit from
    the kaafir, and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.” [This applies] even if
    the money were to be used for the purpose of sadaqah, because of the general applicability

      human years (Sura 70:4) Jazakallaahu khayr.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti said in his book Daf
    Ayhaam al-Idtiraab an Aayaat al-Kitaab (p. 158):
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning) And,
    verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon [al-Hajj
    22:47] indicates that the length of a day with Allaah is a thousand years. The same is
    indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) He arranges (every) affair
    from the heavens to the earth, then it (the affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the
    space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning. [al-Sajdah 32:5]. Another
    aayah indicates something different (interpretation of the meaning): The angels
    and the Rooh [Jibreel] ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand
    years [al-Maaarij 70:4].
There are two ways in which these aayaat may be reconciled:
The first was reported by Ibn Abi Haatim via Sammaak from Ikrimah
    from Ibn Abbaas: the day of a thousand years mentioned in Soorat al-Hajj is one of
    the six days in which Allaah created the heavens and the earth; the day of a thousand
    years mentioned in Soorat al-Sajdah is the length of time it takes for a matter to go up
    to Allaah; and the day of fifty thousand years is the Day of Resurrection.
The second (way of reconciling the aayaat) is that what is meant by all
    of them is the Day of Resurrection, and the difference in the time span depends on whether
    a person is a believer or a kaafir. This is indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the
    meaning): Truly that Day will be a Hard Day, far from easy for the
    disbelievers. [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10]. These two suggestions were mentioned by
    the author of al-Itqaan. And Allaah knows best."
722,2273,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2273,The TenCommandments,"Question

                i'm trying to determine if there is anything in the Quran similar to the Ten Commandents in the Old Testament, particularly the line ""thou shalt not kill."" i have been using search functions on several Quran translation sites to no avail. thank you very much",,"Praise be to Allah.Thank you for your question, which shows an interest in the Quran. We are happy to answer your question here.
There are in the Quran certain aayaat (verses) which some scholars call the verses of the Ten Commandments, because they include ten important commandments given by Allaah to mankind. These aayaat are to be found in two passages of the Quran.
The first is in Soorat al-Anaam, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Say: Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to al-fawaahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.
And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e., judge between men or give evidence, etc.), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allaah. This He commands you, that you may remember.
And, verily, this (i.e., Allaah's commandments mentioned in the above two verses) is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious). [al-Anaam 6:151-153]
The second passage occurs in Soorat al-Israa, and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honour.
And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.
Your Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is ever Most-Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.
And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.
Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
And if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarers, etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e., Allaah will give to me and I will give to you).
And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, not stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.
Truly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves.
And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great sin.
And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).
And do not kill anyone which Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand qisaas Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diya (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e., he should not kill except the killer only). Verily, he is helped (by the Islamic law).
And come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! The covenant will be questioned about.
And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.
And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah.
And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height.
All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.
This is part of al-hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character, etc.) which your Lord has inspired to you (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allaah any other ilaah (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allaahs mercy). [al-Israa 17:23-39]
Perhaps after enjoying reading these verses, you will have a better idea of the Quraan than before, and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life, the start of your way to Islam. May Allaah guide and help you always. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.

723,2281,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2281,Signs of the Hour,"Question

There are various sites regarding prophesies on the last days . The sites give very precise locations and happenings before the last day. Are they true ? . However in Quran there are prophesies but it does not mention the places. If there are any clear indications in Quran or in Hadith about Last Days, can you kindly tell.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Signs of the Hour are the signs that will precede Yawm al-Qiyaamah (the Day of Judgement) and indicate that it is nigh.
The Hour (al-Saa'ah) means the time of reckoning, and is either:
1. Saa'ah sughra (the lesser hour), which is a person's death, whereupon his reckoning starts when he leaves this world and passes into the Hereafter;
2. Or Saa'ah kubraa (the greater Hour), which is when mankind will be resurrected from their graves to be judged and rewarded or punished accordingly.
When the word al-saa'ah is used on its own in the Qur'aan, it refers to the greater reckoning (the Day of Judgement), as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ""People ask you concerning the Hour"" [al-Ahzaab 33:63]
The Signs of the Hour (i.e., the Day of Judgement) are of two types:
1.    Ashraat al-Saa'ah al-Sughra (Minor signs of the Hour)
These are signs that will appear a long time before the Hour approaches, such as the decline of knowledge, the spread of ignorance, drinking of wine or alcohol, competition in the construction of tall buildings, and many others. The scholars have listed almost sixty signs, some of which will accompany the major signs, or will appear afterwards.
2.    Ashraat al-Saa'ah al-Kubraa (Major Signs of the Hour)
These are major signs that will appear shortly before the Day of Judgement comes. These extraordinary events will be:
(1)    The appearance of the Mahdi. At the end of time, a man from the descendents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will appear, and Allaah will help him to make His religion prevail. He will take control of the land (or the earth) and fill it with justice just as it had previously been filled with wrongdoing and oppression. Under his rule, the ummah will be blessed as it has never been blessed before.
This man's name will be like the name of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his father's namewill be like the Messenger's father's name. He will be a descendant of Faatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), through the line of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). He will appear from the East. A number of saheeh ahaadeeth refer to the appearance of the Mahdi, including the following:

1. Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""During the last days of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allaah will send rain for him, and the earth will bring forth its produce. He will give money sihaahan (according to one report, the Prophet was asked, ""What is sihaahan?"" and he said, ""Equally among people."" Reported by Ahmad), and livestock will increase He will live for seven or eight"" - meaning years. (Reported by al-Haakim, 4/557; he said it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim]. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said: its sanad is saheeh. Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 711)
2. Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 'The Mahdi will be of my family (according to one report: of the people of my household) [Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak. He said: this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs, but they did not report it. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him] from the children of Faatimah."" [Reported by Abu Dawood, 11/373 and Ibn Maajah, 2/1368. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', section 6610].
Al-'Allaamah al-Safaareeni said: ""So many reports were narrated concerning the appearance of the Mahdi that they reached the level of Tawaatur in meaning, and this became so well known among the scholars of Sunnah that it is counted as one of their basic beliefs."" (Lawaami' al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah, 2/84).
[Tawaatur: a mutawaatir hadeeth is one that was narrated by so many people and transmitted by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie. Translator]
Imaam al-Shawkaani said: ""The mutawaatir ahaadeeth about the awaited Mahdi, which we managed to find and examine, number fifty, including saheeh, hasan and da'eef munjabir (weak ahaadeeth that are supported by corroborating evidence) reports. They are mutawaatir beyond any shadow of a doubt The reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi are also very many and are judged as having the status of marfoo' ahaadeeth (i.e., ahaadeeth whose isnaads go back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because this is not an issue in which they would have made ijtihaad."" (For more information, see Question #1252).

(2)    Al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal (The ""Antichrist"")
Al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal is a man from the sons of Aadam. He has a number of features which were mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth, including the following: he will be a young man with a ruddy complexion and curly hair, and will be one-eyed, with his right eye looking like a floating grape. Between his eyes will be written ""ka' fa' ra'"" (in unjoined letters) or ""kaafir"" (disbeliever), which every Muslim, literate or illiterate, will be able to read. Another of his attributes will be that he is sterile, and will have no children. Among the ahaadeeth that describe him are the following:
1. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whilst I was sleeping, (I dreamt that) I was doing Tawaaf around the House (the Ka'bah)."" He mentioned that he saw 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, then he saw the Dajjaal, and he described him: ""He is a well-built man, with a ruddy complexion and curly hair. He is one-eyed, with his eye looking like a floating grape. (Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath, 6/485: i.e., it is sticking out. The word yatfaa, with no hamzah, is used to describe something that is on top of something else. It is likened to a grape which is part of the bunch but sticks out from the rest. Al-Nawawi said: the word has been narrated both with the hamzah and without the hamzah. With the hamzah it means that the light has gone out of the eye, and without the hamzah it means that it is sticking out.) They said: ""This is the Dajjaal"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 13/90, and Muslim, 2/237)
2. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the Dajjaal as living among people, and said: ""Allaah, may He be exalted, is not one-eyed, but al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal is one-eyed, and his right eye looks like a floating grape."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 13/90, and Muslim, 18/59)
3. 'Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ""Between the creation of Aadam and the onset of the Day of Judgement, there will be a creation greater than the Dajjaal."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/86). [This means that] the Dajjaal will appear from the East, from Khurasaan, from among the Jews of Isfahaan, then he will travel around the world, leaving no country but he will enter it, except for Makkah and Madeenah, which he will not be able to enter because the angels are guarding them, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him): ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that the Dajjaal would appear from a land in the East called Khurasaan."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 6/495); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', section 3398).

The fitnah (trial, tribulation) of the Dajjaal will be the greatest fitnah ever, seen from the time that Allaah created Aadam until the onset of the Day of Judgement, and this will be because of the power that Allaah will permit him to have, of working great miracles that will amaze and confuse the people. There are ahaadeeth that describe how he will have a ""paradise"" and a ""hell"", but his paradise will in fact be a hell, and vice versa. He will have rivers of water and mountains of bread. He will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth its produce, and it will bring forth its produce. The treasures of the earth will follow him, and he will travel though the earth at great speed, like rain driven by the wind.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his ummah how they can protect themselves from the evil of the fitnah of the Dajjaal, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""When any one of you pronounces the Shahaadah, let him seek refuge with Allaah from four things, and let him say: 'Allaahumma innee a'oodhu bika min 'adhaab jahannam, wa min 'adhaab al-qabr, wa min fitnati'l-mahyaa wa'l-mamaat, wa min sharri fitnati'l-maseeh al-dajjaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell, from the punishment of the grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjaal)."" (Reported by Muslim, 5/87).
Another way of protecting oneself is by memorizing the first aayaat of Soorat al-Kahf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined reciting the first verses of Soorat al-Kahf against the Dajjaal, by reciting the first ten verses, as was reported by al-Nawwaas ibn Sam'aan, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever of you encounters him (the Dajjaal), let him recite the first verses of Soorat al-Kahf against him."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/65). Abu'l-Dardaa' (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever memorizes ten aayaat from the beginning of Soorat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjaal."" (Reported by Muslim, 6/92).
The destruction of the will come at the hands of 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, as is indicated in the saheeh ahaadeeth. 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'The Dajjaal will emerge among my ummah and Allaah will send 'Eesaa ibn Maryam and he will pursue him and destroy him."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/75).

(3)    The descent of 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace
After the Dajjaal has appeared and spread corruption throughout the earth, Allaah will send 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, who will descend to the earth, coming down to the white minaret in the East of Damascus, Syria, resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, drops will fall, and when he raises it, drops like large pearls will fall (these are like grains of silver in the shape of big pearls, and it means that drops of water as pure as pearls will fall. The water is described as pearls because of its purity). No kaafir will smell his breath except he will die, and his breath will reach as far as his eyes can see. He will come down to the victorious group that is fighting for the truth and has come together to fight the Dajjaal. He will descend at the time when the iqaamah for prayer is being given, and he will pray behind the leader of that group.

The reports about his descent are many, including the following:
1. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it is nearly time for the son of Maryam to descend upon you, to judge fairly. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and put an end to war. Wealth will increase so much that no-one will accept it, and one prostration to Allaah will be worth more than the world and all that is in it."" Then Abu Hurayrah said: ""Recite, if you wish: 'And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him ('Eesaa - as a human Messenger of Allaah) before his ('Eesaa's) death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he ('Eesaa) will be a witness against them."" [Al-Nisaa'  4:159 - interpretation of the meaning].'"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/490, and Muslim, 2/189).
2. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""How will you be when 'Eesaa ibn Maryam descends to you and your leader is one of you?"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/491, and Muslim, 2/193).
Imaam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (7/223): ""Mutawaatir ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe how 'Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend before the Day of Judgement as a just leader and fair ruler.""

(4)    Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj (Gog and Magog)
Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are human beings, descended from Aadam and Hawwa, upon whom be peace. According to the descriptions of them given in the ahaadeeth, they belong to the Turkic Mongol race, having small eyes, small, flat noses and wide faces. Their faces look like hammered-out shields (their faces are likened to shields because they are wide and round).
Their appearance at the end of time is one of the signs of the Hour, as indicated in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): ""Until, when Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are let loose (from their barrier), and they swiftly swarm from every mound. And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near (to fulfilment). Then (when mankind is resurrected from their graves, you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror. (They will say): 'Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)."" [al-Anbiyaa' 21:96-97]
In the story of Dhoo'l-Qarnayn, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then he followed (another) way, until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them (those two mountains), a people who scarcely understood a word. They said: 'O Dhoo'l-Qarnayn! Verily! Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?' He said: 'That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier. Give me pieces (blocks) or iron,' then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said, 'Blow,' till when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, 'Bring me molten copper to pour over it.' So they [Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj] were made powerless to scale it or dig through it. (Dhoo'l-Qarnayn) said: 'This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true.' And on that Day [i.e., the day Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj will come out], We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another, and the Trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together."" [al-Kahf 18:92-99]
Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are also mentioned in the Sunnah, in more than one hadeeth, including the following:
1. Umm Habeebah bint Abi Sufyaan reported from Zaynab bint Jahsh that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon her one day in a nervous state, saying, ""La ilaaha ill-Allaah! Woe to the Arabs from the evil that has approached! Today a hole this big has appeared in the barrier of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj,"" and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said, ""O Messenger of Allaah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?"" He said, ""Yes, if evil becomes widespread."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/381, Muslim, 18/2).
2. Al-Nawaas ibn Sam'aan (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported a long hadeeth describing several signs of the Hour. In this hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "" and Allaah will send Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj, swiftly swarming from every mound. They will pass the lake of Tiberias [in Palestine] and will drink everything that is in it. Then the last of them will pass by and will say, 'There used to be water here once.' The Prophet of Allaah, 'Eesaa, and his companions, will be besieged until a bull's head will be more precious to one of them than a hundred dinars are to any of you today. 'Eesaa and his companions will pray to Allaah, and Allaah will send a kind of worm (like that found in the noses of camels and sheep) on their (Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj) necks, and they will fall down dead, all at once. Then 'Eesaa and his companions will come down out of the place where they were besieged, and they will find hardly a handspan of land that is not filled with the stench (of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj), so 'Eesaa and his companions will pray to Allaah, and He will send birds like the necks of camels to carry them away and throw them wherever Allaah wills."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/68).

(5)    The swallowing up of the earth
This means that a place is swallowed up in the earth and disappears into it, as is described in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): ""So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place"" [al-Qasas 28:81]. Among the major signs of the Hour will be three such events, as described in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn Usayd (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not begin until you see ten signs (including) three events where the earth swallows up, one in the East, one in the West, and one in the Arabian Peninsula."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/27).

These events, like other major signs of the Hour, have not happened yet. Although other instances of places being swallowed up by the earth have occurred at various times and in various places, they did not cover so wide an area as to include both East and West. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ""There have been instances of places being swallowed up by the ear, but it could be that what is meant by the three events referred to is events that are worse than anything yet seen, which could be more intense and cover a larger area."" (Fath al-Baari, 13/84).

(6)    The smoke
Another of the major signs of the Hour will be the appearance of the smoke. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment."" [al-Dhukhaan 44:10-11]. A definition of the smoke was narrated from Ibn 'Abbaas, who explained that it is one of the Signs of the Day of Judgement, as was narrated by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Haatim from 'Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Maleekah, who said: ""I went to Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) one day, and he said: 'I did not sleep at all last night.' I asked him, 'Why not?' He said, 'They said that a star with a tail (a comet) had appeared, and I was afraid that the smoke had started, so I could not sleep at all.'""
Imaam Ibn Katheer commented: ""This is a saheeh isnaad, going back to Ibn 'Abbaas, the scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur'aan. This is also the opinion of all the Sahaabah and Taabi'een who agreed with him, in addition, there are many ahaadeeth going back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) - saheeh, hasan and others - which state the same thing. This is convincing evidence that the smoke will be one of the expected signs, as is also clear from the text of the Qur'aan."" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 7/235).
Among the ahaadeeth that describe the appearance of the smoke as one of the signs of the Hour is the following:
1. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Hasten to do good deeds before six things appear: the Dajjaal, the smoke"" (Reported by Muslim, 18/87)
(7)    The rising of the sun from the West
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): "" The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith"" [al-An'aam 6:158]. Most of the mufassireen (commentators) state that one of these signs is the rising of the sun from the West. Among the reports that indicate this are:
1. The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from the West, and when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, but that will be when it will do a person no good to believe, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/352, and Muslim, 2/194).
2. The hadeeth of 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: ""I learned from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a hadeeth that I have never forgotten since. I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 'The first of the signs of the Hour to appear will be the rising of the sun from the West.'"" (Reported by Muslim, 18/78).

(8)    The appearance of the Beast
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our aayaat."" [al-Naml 27:82]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'There are three things which, once they happen, it will do a person no good to believe, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith: the rising of the sun from the West, the Dajjaal, and the Beast of the earth.'"" (Reported by Muslim, 2/195).
Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Beast will emerge, and it will mark all the people on their noses, and this mark will last, so that if a man buys a camel, and is asked who he bought it from, he will say, 'From the man with the mark on his nose.'"" (Reported by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 322).
According to some reports, when the Beast appears, it will mark the believers and the kaafirs. As for the believer, it will make his face shine brightly, as a sign of his faith, and as for the kaafir, it will mark his nose with a sign of his disbelief.
The Qur'aan tells us that the Beast will speak to people, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our aayaat."" [al-Naml 27:82]. This kalaam may refer to actual speech, whereby the Beast will address people, which is supported by the reading of Ubayy ibn Ka'b (tunabbi'uhum, i.e., tell them), or it may convey the other meaning of the word kalaam, to wound, which is supported by the alternative reading (taklamuhum, i.e., mark them by cutting them) reported from Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him).
(9)    The fire which will gather the people together
Another of the signs of the Hour is the great fire which will appear from the direction of Yemen, from the bottom of 'Aden, from the Sea of Hadramawt. Among the ahaadeeth that describe this are the following:
1. The hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn Usayd which mentions the major signs of the Hour, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "" The last of them will be a fire which will emerge from Yemen, and will drive the people to their gathering place."" According to another report: "" and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of 'Aden and drive the people (ahead of it)."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/27).
2. The hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) which states that when 'Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam embraced Islam, he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a number of issues, including the first sign of the Hour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The first sign of the Hour will be a fire which will drive the people from East to West."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/362).
3. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Fire will emerge from Hadramawt or from the sea of Hadramawt (according to another report: from the direction of Hadramawt or from Hadramawt - Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh) before the Day of Judgement, and it will drive the people (ahead of it).'"" (Reported by Ahmad, 7/133; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', 3603).
A number of saheeh ahaadeeth describe how this fire will gather the people together. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The people will be gathered in three ways, willingly or by force, two on one camel, or three or four or even ten on one camel. The rest of them will be gathered together by means of a fire, which will stay with them whenever they stop to rest or to sleep, no matter what the time of day or night."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/377, Muslim, 17/194).
Finally, it should be noted that belief in the signs of the Hour is part of our belief in the Unseen (al-ghayb), without which the belief of the Muslim is incomplete. And Allaah is the Source of Strength.."
724,2282,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2282,Dealing with a person whose sin repeatedly hurts one,"Question

                Asslamualaikum
If a person commits a sin which hurts you, and they repeatedly do it what should one do ??",,"Praise be to Allah.What you should do is advise the person who is committing sin, whether the sin hurts you directly or not, because enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is an important obligation which Muslims are supposed to do all the time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when a community among them said: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?’ (the preachers) said: ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah), and perhaps they may fear Allaah.’” [al-A’raaf 7:164]
In his tafseer (commentary) of this aayah, Ibn Katheer said: “Here Allaah is describing how the people of that town had split into three groups: those who committed sin by using tricks to catch fish on the Sabbath (which Allaah had forbidden them to do), those who told them not to do this wrong deed and boycotted them, and those who kept quiet, neither committing the sin not speaking out against it. But this third group said to those who were telling the sinners not to do it: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or punish with a severe torment?’ i.e., why do you warn these people when you know they are doomed and they deserve to be punished by Allaah, and your telling them not to do it is of no benefit? The preachers said to them, ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah),’ i.e., we are doing this out of obedience to your Lord, Who has instructed us to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; ‘and perhaps they may fear Allaah,’ i.e., perhaps this warning may make them stop what they are doing and return to Allaah in repentance, for if they repent, Allaah will accept their repentance and have mercy on them.”
The Muslim should use different styles of warning and calling people to Islam. Sometimes he uses a soft and encouraging tone, describing the rewards for obedience; sometimes he warns of the punishment for disobedience; sometimes he may tell stories which illustrate an important lesson; sometimes he explains the bad consequences of sin on the person’s life, and so on.
If a person can no longer bear to be close to this sinner, and there is no benefit in advising him, then he should keep away from him and have nothing to do with him. And Allaah is the source of strength and the Guide to the right path."
725,2283,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2283,Is Wine Vinegar Halal?,"Question

Is wine and spirit vinegar halal, considering all vinegar is made from oxidising a form of alcohol and that normal vinegar is supposed to be halal?","1- Vinegar is a well-known basic foodstuff, made from wine of which the composition has changed so that it is no longer sweet but is acidic or sour.
2- When wine turns to vinegar by itself, without any deliberate treatment needed for it to be changed, it is permissible to eat, drink and handle.
3- If the wine has become vinegar because of deliberate treatment, by adding vinegar, onions, salt etc., or by any other process, in this case the scholars differ as to whether it is permissible or not. For more, see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.What is vinegar?
Vinegar is a well-known basic foodstuff, made from wine of which the composition has changed so that it is no longer sweet but is acidic or sour.
Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What a good food vinegar is.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/1623)
Ruling on wine made from vinegar
When wine turns to vinegar by itself, without any deliberate treatment needed for it to be changed, it is permissible to eat, drink and handle, according to the consensus of the scholars, because of the hadith quoted above.
But if the wine has become vinegar because of deliberate treatment, by adding vinegar, onions, salt etc., or by any other process, in this case the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differ as to whether it is permissible.
The Shafi’is, Hanbalis and some of the Malikis say that it is not permissible to deliberately change wine to vinegar because then it is not pure. The evidence for this is the hadith of Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked whether wine could be changed to be used as vinegar. He said, ‘No.’” (Reported by Muslim).
Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about some orphans who had inherited some wine. He said, “Pour it away.” He was asked, “Could they not make it into vinegar?” He said, “No.” (Reported by Muslim).
Why is it not permissible to change wine to vinegar
The reason for this is:
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to avoid wine. Keeping it and treating it until it turns into vinegar means handling it and being involved with it by storing it and benefiting from it, and this is not permitted.
It is permitted for a Muslim to buy vinegar from someone who is selling it, unless he realizes or comes to know that it was produced by means of a deliberate process. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… There is nothing wrong with a man buying vinegar from the people of the Book, if they sell it, so long as he knows that they did not deliberately process it from wine.” (Al-Mughni, 8/330)
And Allah knows best.

      religious but my father is afraid of his mother and what they are going to say about his
      daughter marrying a christian man. my husband to be has converted to the islamic religion
      but according to my partents and family this is not good enough. please help what should i
      do. my husband to be is aware of childeren and also is aware that they will be taught the
      islamic religion.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is regrettable indeed that anyone would fail to adhere to the
    religion which Allaah has commanded us to adhere to. What is even more distressing is the
    fact that a Muslim woman would have a relationship (of any kind) with a non-related
    Christian man for ten years, when she knows that this is something which angers Allaah,
    Who has forbidden believing women to do such things in the Quran (interpretation of
    the meaning):  they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking
    boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]. Equally upsetting is the fact that what
    this Muslim girls father fears most  with regard to the marriage described
     is not Allaah, but what his mother will say and how his reputation among his
    relatives will be affected.
In any case, there is no way out of this problem now except one: this
    man must become Muslim in a real sense, and start to practise Islam, and he and this girl
    should repent for what they have done. Then marrying him will be permissible, and what
    people may say does not matter, so long as everything is done in accordance with Islam and
    in a way that will not earn the anger of Allaah; the matter can also be explained to close
    relatives. If this is not possible, then the relationship with this man should be cut
    completely, and all thought of him should be dismissed from ones mind. If, my
    sister, you feel that there is some harshness in this answer, then by Allaah it is only in
    your best interests and out of concern for you. We ask Allaah to accept our repentance and
    have mercy on us, for He is the One Who accepts repentance and is All-Merciful."

    authenticity You can also put the question on the web page if you so wish, I need a direct reply since I may not be able to find the answer on
    the web page. Jazzakallaah.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with ending a letter with the phrase “wa’l-salaam,”
    and it is not a condition that the phrase should be used in full, because when a written
    abbreviation is used, what the writer means is the complete expression. So when a person
    says “wa’l-salaam,” what he or she means is “wa’l-salaamu
    ‘alaykum.” But if the person sending the letter writes “wa’l-salaamu
    ‘alayka” or “wa’l-salaamu ‘alaykum” at the end,
    this is better. Umar ibn al-Khattaab ended his letter to the qaadi Shurayh with the words
    “wa’l-salaamu ‘alayka” [Sunan al-Nisaa’i, 5304] and
    ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ended his letter to one of his workers in the same
    way [Muwatta’ Malik, Kitaab al-jihaad].
Ibn Katheer reported in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah from Ibn
    ‘Asaakir that Ziyaad ibn Abi Sufyaan sent Sa’eed ibn al-‘Aas gifts, money
    and a letter proposing marriage to his daughter. When the gifts, money and letter arrived,
    [Sa’eed] read the letter, shared out the gifts among the people sitting with him,
    then wrote a nice, polite letter back to him in which he said: “In the name of
    Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Allaah says: ‘Nay! Verily man does
    transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deeds, etc.), because he considers himself
    self-sufficient.’ [al-‘Alaq 96:6-7 – interpretation of the meaning]. Wa’l-salaam.”
However, the person sending the letter should greet the addressee with the
    complete phrase (“Al-salaamu alaykum”) at the beginning of the letter, as
    has been the habit of the Muslims from the time of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) until the present. And Allaah knows best."

I am a non-Muslim, and I was wondering if I become Muslim can I still play basketball?",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, you could become Muslim and still play basketball, so long as there is nothing forbidden or harmful involved. Islam does not forbid sports that exercise the body and strengthen its muscles. Indeed, it is the body’s right that its owner should take care of it, as the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Your body has a right over you.""
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4800). One of the benefits of basketball is that it is based on aiming the ball correctly. So there is nothing wrong with playing it, so long as it is not combined with something forbidden such as gambling or deliberately harming or hitting others, and as long as it does not distract a person from praying and so on. By the way, I am sure that you are not unaware that there are a number of internationally known basketball players who have embraced Islam. Our advice to you is: don’t hesitate to enter Islam, for there is nothing to stop you. We ask Allaah to help you to follow the truth and to guide you to the way of goodness, for He guides whom He wills to the Straight Path."

    who have a satellite dish in their homes","Question

                A person regularly visits his relatives,
      but those relatives have some evil things in their home, like a satellite dish, even
      though they know it is haraam. Should he stop visiting them or should he still visit them?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person has relatives, then it is obligatory to uphold the ties of
    kinship, even if they are not as one would like them to be, because Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and
    good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and
    hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks unto Me and to your parents,
    - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in
    worship with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with
    them in the world kindly…” [Luqmaan 31:14-15]. He did not say “kill
    them”, He said, “but behave with them in the world kindly…”
Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even if the relatives are
    not as one would like them to be. So you must keep in touch with your relatives even if
    they have this dish, which most people use to view haraam things, waste their time and
    money, and corrupt their morals and minds.
If they use the dish to watch haraam things when you are present, then
    do not go to them so that you will not be a partner in their sin, but still we advise
    people to pay attention to their duties towards their relatives, which include advising
    them, i.e., going to them and explaining to them that this – watching haraam things
    – is haraam. Then you will have done your duty of advising them and treating them
    well. 
(Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,
    148).
The Muslim must also pay attention to his children when
    they go to visit these relatives; he should not let his children sit with them when they
    are watching haraam things. The Muslim who is sincere can, if he is smart, divert the
    relatives and others with some interesting talk or useful activities to distract them from
    watching these haraam things; he can strive to make other, permissible forms of
    entertainment available (such as some sports activities or games or useful computer games,
    etc.) This will give the others an alternative to watching haraam things, at least in
    part. We ask Allaah to reform us all, for He is the Guide to the Straight Path."

Classed as Hasan by al-Albaani. See also Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 1461). Nowadays we see hundreds of thousands of Muslims settling among the mushrikeen. Some good people have gone to set up Islamic institutions there, for the purpose of teaching the children of the Muslims, primarily, and also to call people to Allaah. If a teacher is asked to go and settle there in order to teach and call people to Allaah, is it

    will do more good, such as calling people to the religion of Allaah or teaching the Muslim
    children the correct ‘Aqeedah, then there is nothing wrong with it, because the good
    outweighs the evil that may be expected. The hadeeth “I have nothing to do with every
    Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen” may be interpreted as referring to those who
    cannot practise their religion openly in the place where they settle, and those who are
    able to practise their religion openly are not included in this hadeeth. But it is better

Is there any consensus amongst Muslim scholars as to which medicinal preparations are permitted whilst fasting? More specifically are: a) tablets/syrups b)inhalers for asthma c)suppositories and d)intravenous forms of treatment allowed?
The question of inhalers for asthma is very pertinent to us in the UK, as some 20% of young people now suffer from asthma.
I would appreciate a detailed response with reference to any conference proceedings, etc. if possible.","Eye drops, ear drops, ear syringing, nose drops and nasal sprays do not invalidate the fast so long as one avoids swallowing any material that may reach the throat.","Praise be to Allah.There follows a list of a number of things used in the medical field, explaining what does and does not break the fast. This is a summary of Shar`i research presented to the Islamic Fiqh Council during its regular meetings:
The following things do not have any effect on the fast:

Eye drops , ear drops , ear syringing, nose drops and nasal sprays – so long as one avoids swallowing any material that may reach the throat.
Tablets or lozenges that are placed beneath the tongue for the treatment of angina pectoris etc., so long as one avoids swallowing any material that reaches the throat.
Vaginal pessaries, douching, use of a speculum, or internal digital examination.
Introduction of a scope or coil (IUD), etc., into the uterus.
Introduction of a scope or catheter into the urethra (male of female), or injection of dyes for diagnostic imaging, or of medication, or cleaning of the bladder.
Drilling of teeth (prior to filling), extraction or polishing of teeth, using a miswak or toothbrush, so long as one avoids swallowing any material that reaches the throat.
Rinsing, gargling or applying topical treatment in the mouth, so long as one avoids swallowing any material that reaches the throat.
Injections, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous – with the exception of those used for purposes of nutrition.
Oxygen.
Anaesthetics , so long as they do not supply nutrition to the patient.
Medicines absorbed through the skin, such as creams, lotions and patches used to administer medication through the skin.
Introduction of a catheter into the veins in order to examine or treat the vessels of the heart or other organs.
Laparoscopy for the purpose of diagnosis or surgical treatment of the abdominal organs.
Biopsies of the liver and other organs, so long as this is not accompanied by the administration of nutrients.
Gastroscopy , so long as this is not accompanied by the administration of nutrients.
Introduction of medicine or instruments into the brain or spinal cord.
Involuntary vomiting (as opposed to self-induced vomiting).

The Muslim doctor should advise his patient to postpone the above-described treatments and procedures until after he has broken his fast, if it is safe to do so and will not cause any harm (even if these procedures will not have any effect on his fast)."
734,2300,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2300,Knowing how to handle the marital relationship,"Question

                As-Salamu-laykim,
   This is a very complicated question to answer but Insha-Allah, Allah(swt)
      will make it easy for us. I recentlly got married and I find myself in a world of
      problems. Our personalities clash, our mentalities are different.  My wife feels that
      I terrible to her, and the worse part is that it's all misunderstandings that have
      been cleared up through consultations. However, my wife is also supisious, very 
      defiant, and often insults and accuses me of being devious and a hyprocrite.
 So what should
      i do ?",,"Praise be to Allah.Part of the Grace and Kindness of Allaah towards the sons of Adam is
    that He has prescribed marriage for them, and has made it so that they produce offspring
    in this organized and proper fashion. Marriage is one of the strongest and most noble
    covenants in the sight of Allaah, and the family is the most important unit in the
    structure of society. It is essential that a person gives priority to putting his own
    house in order and strives to teach his family the laws of Allaah. One of the things that
    he should make sure he teaches his wife is the duties that she has towards her husband,
    and the rights that are due to her.
Islam has stated these rights and duties, and it obliges and urges both
    spouses to fulfil them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  And
    they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar to (those of their husbands) over
    them to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over
    them [al-Baqarah 2:228]
The aayah states that for every right there is a reciprocal duty which
    must be fulfilled. In this way balance is achieved between them in all aspects, which
    supports the stability of family life. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him)
    said concerning the aayah: It means: they have the right to good companionship and
    kind treatment on the part of their husbands, just as they have to obey their husbands in
    whatever they tell them to do. Ibn Zayd said: Fear Allaah concerning them just
    as they have to fear Allaah concerning you. Al-Qurtubi said: This aayah
    includes all the marital rights and duties.
Among these rights and duties are:
Turning a blind eye to faults and mistakes, especially words and deeds
    by which nothing bad was intended. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
    those who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily Allaah loves as muhsinoon (the
    good-doers). [Aal Imraan 3:134]
Both husband and wife must put up with one another, for every child of
    Adam may slip, and the person whom one should put up with the most is the one with whom
    one lives and mixes the most. Neither party should resort to a tit-for-tat response. If
    one spouse sees the other becoming very angry, he or she should restrain his or her own
    anger and not respond immediately. For this reason Abul-Darda (may Allaah be
    pleased with him) said to his wife: If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I see
    you angry I will calm you down, otherwise we cannot live together.
Among the most important duties is:
Each spouse should advise the other to obey Allaah. According to a
    saheeh hadeeth, some of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him): Can you tell us which kind of wealth is the best, so that we may strive
    to acquire it? He said: The best (wealth) is a remembering tongue (one which
    always remembers Allaah), a thankful heart, and a believing wife who will help you with
    your faith. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/278; al-Tirmidhi, 3039; Saheeh
    al-Jaami, 5231)
    A man should not hate his wife if he sees in her
    something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will
    like another which will make up for it. It was reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No believing man should hate a believing
    woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with another. (Reported
    by Muslim, 36).
    Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Woman was created
    from a rib, and if you try to straighten the rib you will break it, so be gentle with her
    and you will be able to live with her. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/8; Ibn Maajah,
    1308; Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/163).
    One of the most important things that can make married
    life happy is a good attitude, hence Islam raised its status. The Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached the utmost heights of good treatment of others
    and good attitude. Abul-Darda reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) said: There is nothing that can be placed in the scales that
    will weigh heavier than a good attitude, and a good attitude can help a person reach the
    status of one who fasts and prays. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu
    Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The most perfect of
    the believers in faith are those who are the best in attitude, and the best of you are
    those who are best to their women. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1/217; Ahmad,
    2/250; al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 284).
    Both spouses should turn a blind eye and avoid picking
    on matters great and small, or rebuking and scolding about any matter except duties
    towards Allaah. This is what Allaah tells us to do (interpretation of the meaning): 
    And live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a
    thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good. [al-Nisa 4:19]. 
As far as different environments are concerned, a man should take care
    to pay special attention to this, such as allowing his wife to mix with good women from
    among her surroundings and intelligent, well-mannered women from among your surroundings.
    Although she must obey you and not go out of your house without permission, at the same
    time you should not prevent her from going out to places where she wants to go, so long as
    there is nothing bad there. You should let her receive trustworthy women in her house, in
    order to have some social life and a refreshing change of routine, especially in our times
    when many women no longer obey the Divine command to remain in their homes and do not pay
    proper attention to it  especially Muslim women who live in non-Muslim countries
    where there is too much freedom.
We also advise you to give her some freedom of choice in issues that do
    not cause any harm, such as choosing food, colours for things in the house, or gifts to be
    given on various occasions. You should also seek her opinion in matters of concern to you
    both, such as naming your children  knowing that this is your right according to
    Islam  and where to spend your vacation. 
You should also involve her and seek her opinion when making some
    decisions in which it is appropriate to include her, such as dealing with behavioural
    problems in your children, finding ways to reconcile disputing relatives or neighbours,
    and especially in resolving the problems between the two of you. Try to raise her level of
    education with suitable reading material and attendance at gatherings where the program
    and fellow-attendees will help to achieve the desired aim. Such programs may be available
    in some Islamic centres. Know that paying attention to her intellectual level, working
    with her way of thinking, understanding her psychology, treating her appropriately, being
    good to her and making her feel good are among the most effective ways of showing how wise
    and manly you are and how good your personality is. We ask Allaah to reconcile between you
    and bring you back together, and help you both to do that which He likes and which pleases
    Him."

736,2320,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2320,Are Blood Transfusions Haram in Islam?,"Question

What is the ruling of the Shari’ah on blood transfusions?","If the person who is to receive the blood transfusion is a person whose life is in danger due to sickness or injury, and whose life depends on his receiving a blood transfusion, then blood transfusion is not haram. For more, see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al al-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) answered a question about blood transfusions as follows:
 In order to answer this question, we need to discuss three matters:
 1. Who is the person who is to receive the blood transfusion?
2. Who is the person from whom the blood is to be taken?
3. Who is the person whom we can trust to decide whether a blood transfusion is needed?
Who should receive a blood transfusion?
With regard to the first question, the person who is to receive the blood transfusion is a person whose life is in danger due to sickness or injury, and whose life depends on his receiving a blood transfusion.
The principle in this matter is based on the following verse of the Quran (interpretation of the meanings):
“He has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing the limits, then there is no sin on him…” [al-Baqarah 2:173]
“… But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above-mentioned meats), then surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Maidah 5:3]
“… He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity…” [al-An’am 6:119]
The evidence derived from these verses tells us that if the recovery of the sick or injured person depends on a blood transfusion which he needs to save his life, and that there is no other medicine or food that can do the same thing, then it is permissible for him to receive a blood transfusion.
In fact, this comes under the heading of nourishment, not medicine (using forbidden foodstuffs in cases of necessity is permissible, as in the case of a starving man eating dead meat).
Whose blood can be taken?
With regard to the second point, the one from whom blood is taken, this should not result in any serious harm, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no causing harm nor reciprocating harm.”
Who should decide whether a blood transfusion is needed?
As regards the third point, which is the matter of whose opinion should be relied upon to decide whether a blood transfusion is needed, this should be a Muslim doctor. If that is not possible, we see nothing wrong with taking the word of a non-Muslim doctor, whether he is Jewish or Christian (or any other religion), so long as he is experienced in medicine and is trustworthy. 
The principle here is the sahih hadith which describes how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hired a man of Bani Dil as a skilled and experienced guide, although he was a follower of the pagan religion of Quraysh. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2104.) (Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim).
Concerning this matter, the Hay’at Kibar al-‘Ulama (Council of Senior Scholars) stated the following:
1. It is permissible to donate blood , so long as this does not cause him any harm, when there is a need for it to help other Muslims.
2. It is permissible to establish Islamic blood banks to receive and store donated blood, to be kept for any Muslim who may be in need of it, so long as no money is charged to the sick person or the people in charge of his affairs in return for this service.  A blood bank should not be set up as a commercial enterprise or a means of making money , because it is in the public interest of the Muslims.
And Allah knows best"
737,2322,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2322,Is wearing jeans imitating the Kuffar?,"Question

Is wearing jeans considered imitating the Kuffar or is it
ok?",,"Praise be to Allah.Imitating means trying to be like someone, which the fuqahaa' understand to mean being similar in a certain way to the person whom one is imitating. The Muslim is not permitted to imitate the Kuffar by wearing clothing that is unique to them and for which they are known, like the belt worn by Christian monks, or the distinctive headgear of Magians (Zoroastrians) and Jews, because of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Whoever imitates a people is one of them."" (Reported by Abu Dawood, 4/314).
The scholars have specified that the prohibition of imitation applies in two cases:
1. Where what is imitated is clothing that is characteristic of the Kuffar, not things that are worn by others too or things that used to be distinct to them but have now become widespread among other groups too - like the jeans referred to in the question.
2. When the act of imitation happens at a time when the clothing in question is characteristic of the Kuffar. This is because al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) reported that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people wearing shawl-like garments over their heads and shoulders, and said, ""They look like the Jews of Khaybar."" Ibn Hajar commented: ""This could be used as evidence that this kind of garment was characteristic of the Jews at that time, but this is no longer the case, so that garment is now counted as something that is in general permitted."" (Fath al-Baari, 10/275).
The scholars also made an exception concerning Muslims wearing the distinctive clothes of the Kuffar when living in daar al-harb (non-Muslim countries which are at war with Muslims) or for purposes which will benefit the Muslims. Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
""When a Muslim is living in a non-Muslim land (whether or not it is hostile to Islam), he is not expected to differ from them (the Kuffar) in his outward appearance, because of the harm that may result (from dressing as a Muslim). It is preferable, even obligatory, for a man to look like them sometimes, if that will achieve some religious purpose such as calling them to Islam, finding out their secrets in order to tell the Muslims about them, repelling their harm from the Muslims, and other worthwhile aims. But in the Muslim lands where Allah has caused His religion to prevail, and where the Kuffar are in an inferior position and are paying jizyah (taxes paid by non-Muslims living under an Islamic government), it is obligatory for Muslims to look different from the Kuffar."" (Iqtidaa' al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 1/418).
It is clear from the above that jeans are not clothes that are characteristic of the Kuffar or worn only by them, so they are not haraam. However, it is more befitting for the Muslim to try to wear distinctive Islamic dress wherever he is, in obedience to the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Muslim should feel in his heart that he hates the Kuffar and the way they look and behave. This hatred will motivate him to avoid looking like them at all in the way he dresses or in other ways. Do you not see that a person who despises a people or tribe, or people from a certain country, will hate to dress like them, especially if they are poor. As Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: ""Looking like them in external appearance indicates that one loves them in one's heart, and vice versa.""
And Allah knows best."

I have read in the Holy Quran what a jinn is, but I really don't understand what they really are. Can you please send me more information on them? Peace be unto you!","Allah has created different types of jinn. Among them are some who can take on different forms, such as dogs and snakes; some who are like flying winds with wings; and some who can travel and rest. For more about jinn in Islam, see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.What are jinn?
The Quran and Sunnah indicate that the jinn exist, and that there is a purpose for their existence in this life, which is to worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
And I (Allah) created not the jinn and humans, except that they should worship Me (Alone). [al-Dhariyat 51:56].
O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there not come to you messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My Verses? [al-An'am 6:130]
The world of the jinn is an independent and separate world, with its own distinct nature and features that are hidden from the world of humans. The jinn and humans have some things in common, such as the possession of understanding and the choice between the way of good and the way of evil. The word jinn comes from an Arabic root meaning hidden from sight. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily he [Shaytan] and qabiluhu [his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe] see you from where you cannot see them [al-A'raf 7:27]
Origin of jinn
Allah has told us in His Book the essence from which the jinn were created. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire. [al-Hijr 15:27]
And the jinns did He create from a smokeless flame of fire. [al-Rahmaan 55:15].
According to a hadith narrated by ‘Aishah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you. (Reported by Muslim, 5314)
Types of jinn in Islam
Allah has created different types of jinn. Among them are some who can take on different forms, such as dogs and snakes; some who are like flying winds with wings; and some who can travel and rest. Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The jinn are of three types: a type that has wings, and they fly through the air; a type that looks like snakes and dogs; and a type that stops for a rest then resumes its journey. (Reported by al-Tahawi in Mushkil al-Athar, 4/95, and by al-Tabarani in al-Kabir, 22/214. Shaykh al-Albani said in al-Mishkat (2/1206, no. 4148): al-Tahawi and Abul-Shaykh reported it with a sahih isnad)
The jinn and the sons of Adam
Every individual among the sons of Adam has a jinn who has been appointed to be his constant companion (qarin). Ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, There is not one of you who does not have a jinni appointed to be his constant companion. They said, And you too, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Me too, but Allah has helped me and he has submitted, so that he only helps me to do good. (Reported by Muslim, 2814)
Al-Nawawi said in his commentary on Muslim (17/175): 
“He has submitted: he became a believing Muslim. This is the apparent meaning. Al-Qadi said: Know that the ummah is agreed upon the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected from Shaytan, physically and mentally, and with regard to his speech. This hadith contains a reference to the warning against the fitnah (temptation, trial) and whispers of the qarin (constant companion from among the jinn). We know that he is with us so we should beware of him as much as possible.”
The powers of the jinn
Allah has given the jinn powers that he has not given to humans. Allah has told us about some of their powers, such as the ability to move and travel quickly. An ‘ifreet from among the jinn guaranteed to the Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him) that he would bring the throne of the Queen of Yemen to Jerusalem in a moment faster than that needed for a man to get up from where he was sitting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
An ‘ifreet (strong one) from the jinn said: I will bring it [her throne] to you before you rise from your place (council). And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work. One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye! Then when Sulayman saw it placed before him, he said, This is by the Grace of my Lord [al-Naml 27:39-40].
Food and drink of the jinn
The jinn eat and drink. Ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Someone from among the jinn called me, and I went with him and recited the Quran for them. He took us and showed us the traces of where they had been and the traces of their fires. They asked him for food and he said, You can have every bone on which the name of Allah has been mentioned that comes into your possession, as meat, and all the droppings as food for your animals. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, So do not use [these things] for cleaning yourselves [after relieving oneself], for they are the food and provision of your brothers. (Reported by Muslim, 450). 
According to another report: A delegation of jinn from Nasibin came to me, and what good jinn they are! They asked me for food and I prayed to Allah for them, so that they would not pass by bones or droppings, but they would find food on them. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3571). The believing jinn may eat any bone on which the name of Allah has been mentioned, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not permit them to have anything on which Allah's name has not been mentioned; those are for the kuffar among the jinn.
The beasts of the jinn
According to the hadith narrated by Ibn Mas’ud, that we have quoted above, the jinn asked the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for provision, and he said to them: and [you can have] all the droppings as food for your animals.
The dwelling-places of the jinn
The jinn live on this earth where we do. They are mostly to be found in ruins and unclean places like bathrooms, dunghills, garbage dumps and graveyards. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to take precautions when entering such places, by reciting the adhkar (words of remembrance) prescribed in Islam. One of these was reported by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the toilet, he would say, Allahumma innee a'udhu bika min al-khubuthi wal-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the evil ones, male and female).
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 142; and Muslim, 375). Al-Khattabi explained that khubuth is the plural of khabith (evil or dirty masculine form), and khabaith is the plural of khabithah (evil or dirty feminine form), and that what is meant is male and female shayatin.
Some jinn are Muslims and some are unbelievers
Allah tells us that some of the jinn said (interpretation of the meaning):
And some of us are Muslims, and some of us are al-qasitun (disbelievers those who have deviated from the Right Path). And whosoever has embraced Islam, then such have sought the Right Path. And as for the qasitun, they shall be firewood for Hell. [al-Jinn 72:14-15]
The Muslims among the jinn are of different levels as regards righteousness and taqwa. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
[Some jinn said:] There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups, each having a different way (religious sects, etc.) [al-Jinn 72:11]
The story of how the first jinn of this ummah became Muslim was narrated by Abd-Allah ibn Abbas, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out with a group of his Companions heading for the marketplace of Ukaz. This was when the shayatهn were prevented from getting any news from heaven, and shooting stars had been sent against them. The shayatهn went back to their people, who said, What is the matter with you? They said, We cannot get news from heaven, and shooting stars were sent against us. Their people said, Nothing is stopping you from hearing news from heaven except some new event that must have happened. Go and look in the east and the west of the earth, and see if you can find out what it is that is stopping you from hearing news from heaven. Those who went out in the direction of Tihamah came upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Nakhlah, when he was on his way to Ukaz, and found him leading his Companions in Fajr prayer. When they heard the Quran, they listened to it and said, By Allah, this is what is stopping us from hearing news from heaven. When they went back to their people, they said, O our people, we have heard a wonderful Recital (the Quran). It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord (Allah). [al-Jinn 72:2 interpretation of the meaning]. Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the words (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened (to this Quran) [al-Jinn 72:1], and Allah revealed to him what the jinn had said. (reported by al-Bukhari, 731).
Their reckoning on the Day of Resurrection
The jinn will be called to account on the day of Resurrection . Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): but the jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him) (i.e., they will be brought to account) [al-Saffat 37:158]: They will be brought to judgement. Sahih al-Bukhari, Bab Dhikr al-Jinn wa Thawabihim wa Iqabihim.
Protection from the harm of the jinn
Because the jinn can see us while we cannot see them , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us many ways to protect ourselves from their harm , such as seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, reciting Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Nas (the last two Surahs of the Quran), and reciting the words taught by Allah in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): Say: My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they may attend (or come near) me. [al-Muminun 23:97-98]
Saying Bismillah (in the Name of Allah) before entering ones home, before eating or drinking, and before having intercourse will also keep the Shaytan from entering the house or partaking with a person in his food, drink and sexual activity. Similarly, mentioning the name of Allah before entering the toilet or taking off one's clothes will prevent the jinn from seeing a person's ‘awrah or harming him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, To put a barrier that will prevent the jinn from seeing the ‘awrah of the sons of Adam, let anyone of you say Bismillah when entering the toilet. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 551; Sahih al-Jam’i, 3611).
Strength of faith and religion in general will also prevent the jinn from harming a person, so much so that if they were to fight, the one who has faith would win. Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man from among the Companions of Muhammad met a man from among the jinn. They wrestled, and the human knocked down the jinni. The human said to him, You look small and skinny to me, and your forearms look like the front paws of a dog. Do all the jinn look like this, or only you? He said, No, by Allah, among them I am strong, but let us wrestle again, and if you defeat me I will teach you something that will do you good. The human said, Fine. He said, Recite, Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever-living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists [Ayat al-Kursi al-Baqarah 2:255 interpretation of the meaning]. The human said, Fine. He said, You will never recite this in your house but the Shaytan will come out of it like a donkey breaking wind, and he will never come back in until the next morning. (Reported by al-Darimi, 3247)
This is a brief summary about the jinn, and their nature and characteristics. Allah is the Best of protectors and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.
And Allah knows best."

741,2355,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2355,Dhikr after Salah and before Sleeping,"Question

My question is concerning dhikhr after every fard salaا. I have read a hadith that states:
""Allahu Akbar"", ""Al-hamdulillah"" and ""SubhanAllah"" are recited 33 times each. I was informed that it is only a total of 30 times after each compulsory salah (Allahu Akbar, Al-Hamdulillah and SubhanAllah 10 times each). Which, if either, is the correct method for this particular dhikr? 
Also, it has been related to me that you perform the same before you go to sleep except you recite ""Allahu Akbar"" 34 times which will total one hundred.
What is the reward recorded on your behalf for this action? Finally, what is the proper method for performing dhikr on the right hand ? Do you start with the thumb going down and left to right?
Which joints do you count on?","With regard to dhikr after salah and before sleeping, you can say: Subhan Allah 33 times, Al-hamdu Lillah 33 times, and Allahu akbar 33 times.","Praise be to Allah.Dhikr after Salah (prayer)
The dhikr after salah referred to in the question has been reported in a hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever glorifies Allah (says Subhan Allah ) thirty-three times immediately after each prayer, and praises Allah (says Al-hamdu Lillah) thirty-three times, and magnifies Allah (says Allahu akbar) thirty-three times, this makes ninety-nine, then to complete one hundred says La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadir (There is no god except Allah Alone, with no partner, His is the power and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things) his sins will be forgiven even if they are like the foam of the sea.” (Reported by Muslim, 939).
A number of different descriptions of the dhikr after salah have been narrated, an example of which has been referred to in the question. The evidence for this is the hadith of Abd-Allah ibn Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are two qualities, no Muslim man acquires them but he will enter Paradise, and they are simple and easy. He should glorify Allah (say Subhan Allah) ten times immediately after each prayer, and praise Him (say Al-hamdu Lillah) ten times and magnify Him (say Allahu akbar) ten times. I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting this on his fingers. He said: That makes one hundred and fifty on the tongue, and one thousand five hundred (hasanat) in the scales.
[Translator's note: each of three phrases repeated ten times makes thirty; multiplied by the number of daily prayers, which is five, makes one hundred and fifty. Each of these good deeds of the tongue will be rewarded with ten hasanat which will be added to the total of good deeds to be weighed in the balance or scales on the Day of Judgement]. When you go to bed, glorify Him and praise Him and magnify Him one hundred times: that will be one hundred on the tongue and a thousand in the scales. Who among you does two thousand and five hundred sayyiat (bad deeds) in one day? They said: How could we not count (our sins)? He said: The Shaytan comes to any one of you whilst he is praying and says, Remember this, remember that, until he finishes his prayer and does not do (this dhikr), or he comes to him when he is lying down and makes him sleepy, until he falls asleep (without doing this dhikr). (Abu ‘Isa said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 3332).
Dhkir before sleeping 
Among the adhkar that may be recited before going to sleep, as referred to in the question, is that reported in the hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that Fatimah (upon whom be peace) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him for a servant. He said, “Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan Allah thirty-three times, Al-hamdu Lillah thirty-three times, and Allahu akbar thirty four times.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4943)
How to count tasbih with fingers
As regards counting this tasbih , the Sunnah is to use the fingers of the right hand, although it is permitted to use the left hand. The evidence that the right hand is preferable was reported by Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him), who said: ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Umar ibn Maysarah and Muhammad ibn Qudamah, among others, told us: Aththam told us from al-A’mash from ‘Ata ibn al-Saib from his father from Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the tasbih. Ibn Qudamah said: With his right hand. (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitab al-Salah, Bab al-Tasbih bil-hasa)
It was said in Hashiyat at-Tahtawi: “It is correct that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the tasbih on his right hand. It was reported that he said: Count with your finger tips, for they will be asked and they will be made to speak. Ibn Hijr said: Counting the tasbih with the fingertips is better than using the subhah (prayer-beads or rosary).”
The sunnah is to count with the fingertips by putting them on the palm of the hand. As to precisely which finger of the right hand one should start with, I have no specific information on this.

I would like to know the Islamic view point of mahr (dowry). Is it permissible for the wife to take it or is it a sin?  If it is wrong, what should a person who has taken mahr do?","Mahr in Islam is the right of the wife, and it is not permitted for her father or anyone else to take it except with her approval.","Praise be to Allah.Mahr in Islam
Mahr  is one of the rights of the wife, which is hers to take in total and is lawful for her, in contrast to the widespread practice in some countries, where the wife is given no dowry. 
Evidence for the permissibility of taking the mahr
Evidence that the wife must be given her dowry is found in many places, for example the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And give to the women (whom you marry) their mahr (obligatory bridal gift given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart…” [al-Nisa 4:4]
Ibn 'Abbas said: “This refers to the mahr (dowry).”
Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, said, summarizing the comments of the mufassirin on this verse: “The man must definitely pay the dowry to the woman, and he should not resent it.”
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a cantar (of gold, i.e., a great amount) as mahr, take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin? And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant?” [al-Nisa 4:20-21]
Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 
“This means: if any one of you wants to divorce his wife and replace her with another, you should not take anything from what you have already given the first wife, even if it was a huge amount of wealth. The mahr is given in exchange for the right to enjoy marital relations. For this reason Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other…?” The “firm and strong covenant” is the marriage contract.
Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there were traces of yellow (perfume) on him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him about it, and he told him that he had just married a woman of the Ansar. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, “How much did you give her?” He said: “Gold equal to the weight of one date stone.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give a walimah (wedding feast) even if only with one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4756)
Can the father take the mahr without the wife’s approval?
The mahr is the right of the wife, and it is not permitted for her father or anyone else to take it except with her approval. Abu Salih said: “When a man married off his daughter, he would take her mahr away from her, but Allah forbade them to do that, and gave women the right to the mahr they received.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)
Can the wife forgo any part of the mahr? 
Similarly, if the wife foregoes any part of the mahr , the husband is permitted to take it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allah has made it lawful).” [al-Nisa 4:4]

    Allaah has allowed him to marry, but he is encouraged to marry a Muslim woman who is
    religious and has a good moral character (because this is the basis of true happiness).
    Similarly, he is permitted to marry a chaste woman of the People of the Book, i.e., Jews
    and Christians. Another basis for a happy marriage is that his parents should be pleased
    with his choice of bride, and part of the way in which parents show their love and
    kindness towards their son is by helping him to get married, whether financially or in
    other ways. As regards what you say about striving and fighting for the sake of love, we
    should stop and think about this matter carefully. We believe that feeling love for a
    particular woman is not the be-all and end-all in a Muslim’s life, for which he
    should give up everything that matters to him. No way! The Muslim is wise and pays
    attention to everything that is in his interests, such as the woman’s religious
    commitment and moral character, his parents’ approval, his own honour and reputation
    among people, the future of the marriage and its potential to endure, whether any bad
    things will result from his marriage to a particular woman and whether this outweighs his
    interests, the environment in which the children of the marriage will grow up, the nature
    of his future in-laws with whom he will have to mix, etc. It is not the matter of a
    fleeting desire, rather it is the matter of one’s future and eventual destiny. 
Finally, we say that the love of a woman is not
    some god to be worshipped, rather it is a matter that is governed by the laws of the One
    God, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds."

                What is the importance of being truthful, both in personal and business relationships, in Islam? Is lying ever considered and ""acceptable"" action?",,"Praise be to Allah.Being truthful means speaking the truth and also saying things that
    reflect reality. 
Being truthful is one of the necessities of a human society, one of the
    virtues of human behaviour, and brings great benefits, whilst lying is one of the major
    elements of corruption in human society, and the cause of the destruction of social
    structure and ties, one of the most evil features of bad conduct, and causes widespread
    harm. Hence Islam commanded truthfulness and forbade lying.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who
    are true (in word and deeds). [al-Tawbah 9:119] 
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (2/414): It
    means: be truthful and adhere to truthfulness, and you will be among its people and will
    be saved from calamity, and this will make a way out for you from your problems.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 if they had been true to Allaah, it would have been
    better for them. [Muhammad 47:21]
Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him)
    said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    You must be truthful, for truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness
    leads to Paradise. A man will keep speaking the truth and striving to speak the truth
    until he will be recorded with Allaah as a siddeeq (speaker of the truth). Beware
    of telling lies, for lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hellfire. A man
    will keep telling lies and striving to tell lies until he is recorded with Allaah as a
    liar. (Reported by Muslim, 4721)
    This hadeeth indicates that truthfulness leads to
    righteousness (al-birr), an all-embracing concept that includes all kinds of
    goodness and different kinds of righteous deeds. Immorality is basically an inclination
    towards deviation from the truth, and the immoral person (faajir) is one who is
    inclined to turn away from the path of guidance. Hence immorality and righteousness are
    diametrically opposed.
Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with them
    both) said: I memorized from the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him): Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you
    doubt, for truthfulness is certainty and tranquillity, whilst lying is doubt and
    confusion. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2520; al-Nisaa'i, 8/327; and Ahmad,
    1/200)
    In the lengthy hadeeth of Abu Sufyaan describing his
    meeting with Heraclius, Abu Sufyaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
    [Heraclius] said, What does he [meaning the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him] command you to do? I said, He says: worship Allaah alone
    and do not associate anything in worship with Him, and abandon that which your forefathers
    did. He commands us to pray, to be truthful, to be chaste and to uphold the ties of
    kinship. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/30 and Muslim, 1773).
    Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased with him)
    reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Two
    parties to a deal have the option of changing their minds until they part; if they are
    open and honest, their deal will be blessed, and if they conceal and tell lies, the
    blessing of their deal will be diminished. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/275
    and Muslim, 1532.)
    Truthfulness includes being truthful towards Allaah by
    worshipping Him sincerely; being truthful towards ones own soul by making it adhere
    to the laws of Allaah; and being truthful with people in one's words and by keeping one's
    promises, and in dealings such as buying, selling and marriage, so there should be no
    deceiving, cheating, falsifying or withholding of information. Thus a person should be the
    same on the inside and the outside.
As regards lying, it is highly forbidden, and is of varying degrees of
    abhorrence and sin. The most obnoxious form of lying is falsely attributing things to
    Allaah and His Messenger, because this involves fabrication about the religion and is an
    act of outrage against Allaah. Hence one of the characteristics of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that he truthfully conveyed that which Allaah
    commanded him to convey. So Allaah said (interpretation of the meanings):
 who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against
    Allaah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. Certainly Allaah guides not the people
    whi are zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.) [al-Anam 6:144]
And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allaah?
    Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, These are the
    ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allaah is on the zaalimoon
    (polytheists, wrong-doers, oppressors, etc.). [Hood 11:18]
Equally bad is lying about the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), as he is reported to have said in the mutawaatir hadeeth:
    Whoever lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell. (Agreed
    upon).
    The basic rule with regard to lying is that it is not
    permitted, but there are certain circumstances in which Islam permits lying to serve a
    greater purpose or to prevent harm.
One of these situations is when a person mediates between two disputing
    parties in order to reconcile between them, if reconciliation cannot be achieved in any
    other way. Um Kalthoom (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: He is not a liar who reconciles between
    people and conveys something good or says something good. (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 2495).
    Another example is a mans speaking to his wife, or
    a woman speaking to her husband, with regard to matters that will strengthen the ties of
    love between them, even if that is accompanied by exaggeration. Asma bint Yazeed
    said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Lying is not permitted except in three cases: a mans speaking to his wife to
    make her happy; lying at times of war; and lying in order to reconcile between
    people. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1862; he said: it is a hasan hadeeth.
    See also Saheeh Muslim, 4717).
    One of the most important forms of both being truthful
    and lying is in the area of promises and covenants. Being truthful in promises and
    covenants is one of the characteristics by which the believers are known. Both promises
    and covenants involve saying something about an issue to confirm that you will do it,
    especially with regard to one's duties towards Allaah. Allaah says, praising some of His
    slaves (interpretation of the meanings): 
Those who are faithfully true to their amaanaat (all the
    duties which Allaah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts, etc.) and to
    their covenants. [al-Muminoon 23:8]
 and who fulfil their covenant when they make
    it [al-Baqarah 2:177]
Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant
    with Allaah [i.e., they have gone out for jihad (holy fighting), and showed not their
    backs to the disbelievers], of them some have fulfilled their obligations (i.e., have been
    martyred), and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed [i.e., they
    never proved treacherous to their covenant which they concluded with Allaah] in the
    least. [al-Ahzaab 33:23]
We ask Allaah to make us sincere and truthful in word and deed. And
    Allaah knows best."
756,2425,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2425,The benefits of circumcision outweigh the pain,"Question

                First I would like to thank you for
      operating such a service over the internet. I live in a relatively isolated part of the
      U.K and have had no joy from trying to get an answer to my query from the main Mosque in
      the U.K (Regents Pk. Mosque).
    I am a Muslim happily married to an English lady. We have a 9 month old
      baby boy. The time has come for me to decide whether or not he should have circumcision
      performed. I have read your previous replies about circumcision, from which I got my first
      answer that circumcision is 'Sunnah' and not farz. On a medical point of view I know that
      it is very hygienic if a person has circumcision and those without can experience
      infections etc. in later life. But this cannot be used as justification because it can be
      also argued that a persons appendices or toneless should be removed at birth because of
      the chance of them causing a problem in later life. My reasons of yes 'it is Islamic to
      have circumcision' are sometimes outweighed by 'why should I cause a young 9 month old
      baby pain'.What in your mind are the implications of not having cicumcision performed on
      my son for the sole reason that I will be causing a small defenseless boy pain like he has
      not experienced before?. How does Allah justify such pain? 
   I know that you are busy and you can't always reply to questions, but
      please put my question in a que if neccesary, but please do reply because I need to make a
      decision before it is too late for a safe operation to be conducted. Salam",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, there are benefits of circumcision insofar as it is part of the sunan
    (ways) of the Prophets and is part of the sunan al-fitrah (acts that befit the
    natural state of man). It is cleaner and healthier in terms of urination and intercourse,
    and prevents infection, etc. These and other benefits far outweigh the pain caused, which
    is less for infants than for adults. 
Moreover, a number of the scholars have said that circumcision is
    obligatory for males. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni:
    Circumcision is an obligation for men and an honour, not an obligation, for
    women. This is the opinion of a number of scholars. Ahmad said: It is more of
    an obligation for men, because if a man is not circumcised, this piece of skin will be
    dangling down over the head of the penis and it will be too difficult to clean left-over
    urine properly. It is not so strict in the case of women. Abu Abd-Allaah said:
    Ibn Abbaas used to be very strict in this matter, and it is reported that he
    said that no Hajj or salaah would be accepted, i.e., from the one who is not
    circumcised. Al-Hasan was more lenient; he said: If a person enters Islam, it
    is not essential for him to be circumcised. And he said: Black and white
    people embraced Islam, but not one of them was checked or forced to get circumcised.
The evidence that it is obligatory is the fact that covering the awrah
    (private parts) is obligatory, so if circumcision were not obligatory, it would not be
    permissible for the one who wants to be circumcised to uncover his awrah for
    this purpose. Circumcision is one of the signs of a Muslim, and like the other signs, it
    is obligatory. If an adult male embraces Islam and is afraid that circumcision would be
    harmful for him, then he is excused, because a person may be excused from ghusl,
    wudoo, etc., if he fears that they may be harmful for him, so it is more so in the
    case of circumcision. If a person is confident that it will not be harmful, then he has to
    do it. Hanbal said: I asked Abu Abd-Allaah about the Dhimmi (non-Muslim under
    Islamic rule) who embraces Islam: did he think that he should be circumcised? He said:
    There is no alternative to that (i.e. he has to). I asked: what if he or she
    is advanced in age? He said: It is better for him to be circumcised, because of the
    hadeeth: Ibraaheem was circumcised when he was eighty years old, and Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning):  it is the religion of your father
    Ibraaheem [al-Hajj 22:78]
So our advice to you is to go ahead and have your son circumcised by
    someone who is skilled and experienced. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: Five things are part of the fitrah: circumcision, removing
    the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit
    hair. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5441)
May Allaah help us and you to do good."
757,2427,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2427,Where should one    place one’s hands when standing up from rukoo’?,"Question

As-Salaamu Alaikum! I was curious about whether we should place our hands back on our chest when coming up from bowing. I've heard two different opinions regarding this and I would like to know the strongest opinion, Insha Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.This is one of the issues on which the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have differed. Some of them think that placing the right hand on the left forearm when standing up from rukoo is sunnah mustahabbah (preferable) because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Sahl ibn Sad al-Saaidi (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The people were told that a man should place his right hand on his left forearm in prayer. They said: the general meaning of the phrase in prayer makes it clear that when standing up from rukoo, one should place ones hands thus, because the qiyaam (standing) includes the standing both before rukoo and after, so a person should place his right hand on his left forearm in both qiyaams.
They said that during rukoo, the hands should be on the knees, in sujood they should be on the ground, in juloos (sitting) they should be on the thighs, and in qiyaam (standing) they should be on the chest. This is where the hands should be during the qiyaam before rukoo and after. The attitude of humility and proper conduct before the Lord requires this in both qiyaams, and this position is the furthest away from fidgeting. Other scholars think that the right hand does not have to be placed on the left forearm after standing up from rukoo, and their evidence is the fact that no specific report on this matter has been narrated, as well as the fact that the general meaning of qiyaam does not include standing up from rukoo, because this is a straightening of the back, not a standing (qiyaam), so the person should let his hands drop to his sides.
Some scholars say that a person has the choice of placing his hands on his chest or not, because nothing clear has been reported in the Sunnah on this point. This is the opinion of Imaam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him.
The first opinion is more likely to be correct, in sha Allah, but in any case, either way is valid. Differences in such matters should not lead to reprehensible disputes and conflict, or accusations of bidah if someone does this, or of neglecting the Sunnah if he does not. Such comments can only be made in cases where there is a clear saheeh text and definite evidence.
For more information on this matter, see:
Al-Furoo by Ibn Muflih, 1/433; al-Insaaf by al-Mirdaawi, 2/63; Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat, 1/185; al-Sharh al-Mumti by Ibn Uthaymeen, 3/146. The hadeeth scholar Shaykh Badee al-Deen al-Sindi wrote a paper specifically on this topic in which he supported the opinion that it is sunnah to place the right hand on the left forearm after standing up from rukoo: Ziyaadat al-Khushoo bi wad al-Yumna alal-Yusra bad al-Rukoo. Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abd-Allah ibn Baz also wrote a paper on this topic, in which he supported the idea of putting the hands on the chest after standing up from rukoo.

 Qur’aan","Question

                Salam o Aleikum,
      A friend of mine brought to my attention this Web site where the guy changed the verses
      of the Qoran and says it is the Qoran. 
     This is the site: XXXXXXX
      What can we do to stop this?
     I have a question if anybody can answer. I have a christain friend who wants me to go
      to her wedding where I know they will say ""the three"" and ""son of god""
      during the ceremony. What does a muslim do in that situation, does he go to the ceremony
      or just the party afterwards. Also what if somebody converts to Islam and her sister is
      getting married (who is still christain) does that person attend the ceremony? 
      Thank you very much and please cite your sources.",,"Praise be to Allah.Before answering this question, we should advise you of the importance
    of wisdom in denouncing evil, and of being careful not to inadvertantly promote
    anti-Islamic websites so that everyone will go and read them, because this will indirectly
    contribute to the promotion of these worthless people who claim to imitate the
    Qur’aan. 
Producing anything like the Qur’aan is impossible, because Allaah
    challenged anyone to do this. This challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent
    Arab poets at the time when the Qur’aan was revealed, which was also the time when
    Arabic eloquence was at its peak. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “Let
    them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur’aan) if they are truthful.” [al-Tur
    52:34]
When they could not do this, Allaah challenged them to produce ten
    soorahs like its soorahs: “Or they say: ‘He (Muhammad) forged it (the
    Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged soorahs (chapters) like unto it,
    and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the
    truth!’” [Hud 11:13 – interpretation of the meaning].
When they could not do this, Allah challenged them to produce just
    one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the Qur’aan. He said
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Or do they say: ‘He (Muhammad) has forged
    it’? Say: ‘Bring then a soorah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever
    you like, besides Allah, if you are truthful!” [Yoonus 10:38]
Allah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted, and to
    accept the challenge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you (Arab
    pagans, Jews, Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our
    slave (Muhammad), then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses
    (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23]
When they were unable to do this, Allah informed them that they
    would never be able to do it, no matter who they called upon to help them. He said
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and jinn were together to
    produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if
    they helped one another.’” [al-Isra’ 17:88]
There is no one except Allah who can produce the like of the
    Qur’aan, because the Qur’aan, as He says, is “a Book, the Verses whereof
    are perfected and then explained in detail from One Who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted
    (with all things).” [Hud 11:1 – interpretation of the meaning].
When some liars did try to imitate the Qur’aan they came up
    with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh, let alone mature and intelligent
    adults. For example, the liar Musaylimah said: “O frog, daughter of two frogs, croak
    as much as you want, your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the
    mud.” This is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to
    Prophethood. (See Sayd al-Khaatir by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 404).
    Some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people
    because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted
    styles of eloquence in Arabic. But anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at
    least be able to see the difference and realize that these made-up words cannot possibly
    be Qur’aan. If we look at the Website referred to in the question, we see that kufr
    is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs, such as the statement that the
    Messiah is the son of God or is God, and the promotion of the evil madhhab of Raafidah (a
    kind of Shi’ah), and other such nonsense. There are also some weird contradictions,
    for example, these liars say in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah
    al-tajassud”: “Exalted be He above taking any of His creation as a son,”
    but then we find in the so-called ninth aayah of the so-called “soorah
    al-eemaan” the words: “You are he, the son of God, truly; in you we
    believe.” But verily Allah has spoken the truth when He said (interpretation of the
    meaning): “Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from
    other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.” [al-Nisaa’
    4:82]
You also find other silly comments in these made-up soorahs, such
    as the claim that Allah permitted His Prophet to change whatever he wanted in the
    Qur’aan, as in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah
    al-wasaaya”: “Abrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that We
    have given you, for We permit you to make changes to Our decisions”!
Every Muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these
    words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives. Have you ever seen
    anything more foolish than these words? Allah has told us to adhere to His Book and put it
    into practice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And this is a blessed
    Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive
    mercy.” [al-An’aam 6:155] 
He commanded His Messenger to adhere to the Qur’aan, saying
    (interpretation of the meaning): “So hold you (Muhammad) to that which is inspired
    in you. Verily, you are on a Straight Path.” [al-Zukhruf 43:43]. 
Allah warned His Messenger not to fail in conveying the message
    complete and unaltered, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, they
    were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad), to
    fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you
    for a friend! And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a
    little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in
    this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found
    none to help you against Us” [al-Isra’ 17:73-75] and “… if he
    (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely should have seized
    him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off
    his life artery (aorta)” [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46]. Having said all this, how can
    there be any so-called soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever
    he wants in the Qur’aan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever
    rules he wants??
The only One Who can abrogate whatever He wants of the Qur’aan is
    the One Who revealed it, may He be glorified, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah
    blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the
    Book” [al-Ra’d 13:39]; 
“Whatever a Verse (revelation) We abrogate or cause to be
    forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do
    all things?” [al-Baqarah 2:106]. 
We, like our Messenger, are obliged to understand and implement the
    Qur’aan without distorting, omitting or changing anything. Allah said (interpretation
    of the meaning): “(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of
    blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may
    remember.” [Saad 38:29].
We have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that Internet website a
    real example of what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And
    verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so
    that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say:
    ‘This is from Allah,’ but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against
    Allah while they know it.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:78]. 
We ask Allah to make His Religion and His Book prevail and to make His
    friends victorious, as We ask Him to defeat and humiliate His enemies and cause them to
    fail. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

2.	Allah has raised Prophet Muhammad to a high status.

5.	You should follow his Sunnah in word and deed, so that his Sunnah is the path you follow in your whole life.","Praise be to Allah.Why is it important to love the Prophet?

It increases faith: The strength of love for Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is connected to the Muslim’s faith. When his faith increases, his love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) increases.
It is an act of obedience: Loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is an act of obedience to Allah and a means of drawing closer to Him.
It is an obligation: Loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is one of the obligatory duties in Islam. 

Anas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his child and all the people.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 15; Muslim, 44) 
How to Increase Our Love for Prophet Muhammad
You can increase your love of Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by realizing that: 

Prophet Muhammad was sent by his Lord Who chose him above all of creation to convey the religion of Allah to mankind. Allah chose him because He loved him and was pleased with him. If Allah were not pleased with him, He would not have chosen him. So we must love the one whom Allah loves and be pleased with the one with whom Allah is pleased. We must realize that he is the close friend (Khalil) of Allah and that close relationship is a higher status and it is the highest degree of love. 

Jundub said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “I declare before Allah that I have no close friend (Khalil) from among you. Allah has taken me as a close friend as he took Ibrahim as a close friend. If I were to have taken a close friend from among my Ummah, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend.” (Narrated by Muslim, 532)

Allah has raised the status of Prophet Muhammad very high, for he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best of mankind. 

Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will be the leader of mankind of the Day of Resurrection, the first whose grave will be opened, the first to intercede and the first to be asked to intercede.”  (Narrated by Muslim, 2278) 

He suffered trials and difficulties in order to bring Islam to us. We should remember that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was persecuted, hit, slandered and insulted; the closest people to him disowned him and accused him of being a madman, a liar and a sorcerer. He fought the people in order to protect the religion so that it could reach us; they fought him, expelled him from his people and homeland, and gathered armies against him.  
We should follow the example of his companions who loved him deeply. They loved him more than their wealth, children, and their own selves. There follow some examples of that: 

Anas said: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when the barber was cutting his hair and his companions were going around him wanting to ensure that his hair would fall only into someone’s hand.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2325) 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “On the Day of Uhud some of the people fled and left the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Abu Talhah stood before him covering him with a shield. Abu Talhah was a powerful archer who broke two or three bows that day. When a man passed by carrying a quiver containing arrows, he would say: Give them to Abu Talhah. Whenever the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his head to look at the people, Abu Talhah would say: O Prophet of Allah, may my father and my mother be sacrificed for you, do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your neck.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3600; Muslim, 1811) 

You should follow his Sunnah in word and deed, so that his Sunnah is the path you follow in your whole life, and you put his words before any other words and put his command before everything else; and you should follow the `Aqidah (belief) of his noble Companions, and the `Aqidah of the Tabi’in who followed them, and the `Aqidah of those who followed their path until the present day, namely Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, and avoid Bid’ah (religious innovation), especially the Rafidis (Shi`ah), for their hearts are hardened against the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and they give their Imams precedence over him and love them more than they love him.  

We ask Allah to help us to love His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to make him dearer to us than our children, parents, families and our own selves. 
And Allah knows best."

Is it a sunnah to wear a cap (or turban) especially during salat? I see many 'learned' brothers simply say that this is not sunnah and therefore pray without covering the head. Does Rasulullah Sallalahu Alaihi wassalam wear a turban or cap all the time even outside salat? Is this an Arab tradition or something that Allah recommended Rasul to do as an example to his ummah?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying [Al-Araaf 7:31]

                From where in Qur'an, few killers find their way ? Is such way already exist?",,"Praise be to Allah.Why does the question associate between crime and the holy Qur'aan? 
The Qur'aan was sent as a mercy for people, as a guidance and light, to guide to truth and 
righteousness and the Straight Path.
No one can believe that any person with religion or any mercy in his heart would split a 
pregnant woman's belly and take the infant out then kill it; kill children one by one in front of 
their parents; smash heads with axes; or, burn the living. Only a criminal with a heart harder than 
a stone which has no mercy, does not know Allaah, and does not believe in the hereafter would 
do such acts. It is not even possible for a sane person to believe that such a person is a 
Muslim. This is a fact that can't be hidden even if the person is disguised in Muslim clothing 
and grows a beard. Furthermore, it is not possible to call the killing of unarmed innocent 
Muslim villagers Jihaad. A Muslim--even while in Jihaad to establish the word of Allaah and in 
battle with the armies which stand to stop the spread of the word of Allaah--is absolutely not 
permitted to mutilate the dead; nor to kill a child; nor to kill a woman unless she bears weapons; 
nor to burn anyone with fire. 
For those who want to know what Islam is, they need to learn it from the Qur'aan and the 
Hadeeth (recorded sayings) of the Prophet , and not through the behavior of criminals and 
the suspicious."

If a person was dying from a terminal illness, and treatment offered was unlikely to benefit (although a remote possibility that it could help), does the person have to take the treatment?  As the treatment has many bad side-effects, and the person may not want to suffer them?  In general, does a Muslim have to take medicine for illnesses, or is it optional?","1- Medical treatment or seeking a cure is allowed. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haram.”
2- The patient should not forget to put his trust in Allah and seek refuge in Him, for the gates of Heaven are open to those who call on Allah.","Praise be to Allah.Generally speaking, medical treatment or seeking a cure is allowed, because of the report of Abu’l-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haram’” (Abu Dawud, 3376)
Usamah ibn Shurayk (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Bedouin said, “O Messenger of Allah, should we not treat sickness?” He said: “Treat sickness , for Allah has not created any disease except He has also created the cure, except for one disease.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is it?” He said: “Old age.”’” (Al-Tirmidhi, 4/383, no. 1961) He said: This is a sahih hasan hadith. See also Sahih al-Jami’, 2930)
 The majority of scholars (Hanafi and Maliki) said that medical treatment is permitted.  The Shafi`is, and al-Qadi, Ibn ‘Aqil and Ibn al-Jawzi among the Hanbalis, said that medical treatment is recommended, because of the hadith “Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haram,” and other hadiths which contain instructions to seek cures.  
They said: the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used cupping and other kinds of treatment indicates that medical treatment is permitted.  
For the Shafi`is, treatment is mustahabb when there is no certainty that it will be beneficial , but when treatment is certain to be beneficial (such as putting a dressing on a wound), then it is obligatory (an example would be blood transfusions in certain cases).
(See Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 5/215, 249; al-Hidayah Takmilat Fath al-Qadir, 8/134; al-Fawakih al-Dawani, 2/440; Rawdah al-Talibin, 2/96; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 2/76; al-Insaf, 2/463; al-Adab al-Shar’iyyah, 2/359ff, Hashiyat al-Jumal, 2/134)
 Concerning the sahih hadiths that speak about medical treatment , Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“This does not contradict tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah), just as warding off hunger, thirst, heat and cold does not contradict tawakkul.  The essence of tawakkul is not complete without resorting to the means which Allah has set out in order for us to achieve results both according to His decree (qadr) and His laws (Shar`). 
Not using these means is contrary to tawakkul: it goes against and undermines the command and wisdom of Allah, although the one who neglects the means may think that this makes his tawakkul stronger. Ignoring the means is a sign of helplessness that goes against the true essence of tawakkul, which is that the heart relies on Allah to bring the slave whatever will benefit him in this world and the next, and to protect him from whatever may harm him in this world and the next. But along with this reliance, it is essential to take the appropriate means, otherwise he will be going against the wisdom and command of Allah.  Helplessness should not be taken as a sign of tawakkul, nor should tawakkul make a person helpless.” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 4/15. See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/116)
In summary, therefore, seeking a treatment or cure is not obligatory according to the scholars, unless – according to some – it will definitely be of benefit.  Since in the situation described in the question there is no certainty that treatment will be of benefit, and indeed it is likely to cause suffering to the patient, then there is nothing at all wrong with not giving the treatment.  
The patient should not forget to put his trust in Allah and seek refuge in Him, for the gates of Heaven are open to those who call on Allah.  He may also seek treatment (ruqya) by reciting Quran , such as reading al-Fatihah, al-Falaq and al-Nas over himself.  This will benefit him psychologically and physically, as well as bringing him reward.  Allah is the Healer and there is no healer but He.

Also, is it allowed to give away a received gift ? For example, I received several salad bowls and I do not need them all. Is it permissible to give away some of them as a gift to someone else ?",,"Praise be to Allah.The teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to blot out pictures and to destroy statues, because of the hadeeth of Abu’l-Hayyaaj al-Asadi, who said: “ ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me, ‘Shall I not send you with the same instructions that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him] sent me with? Do not leave any statue without eliminating it or any raised grave withour levelling it.”
(Reported by Muslim, 1609). So it is OK to break pictures of animate objects and get rid of them. As for the silver-plated vessels, it is not permissible to use them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who drinks from a vessel of silver is gargling fire from Hell into his stomach.” (Reported by Muslim, 3846). The ruling on items that are plated or coated with gold and silver is that same as the ruling on items that are made of gold and silver. With regard to giving away gifts that have been given to you, there is nothing wrong in doing so, because a person takes possession of the gift when he receives it, and he is permitted to dispose of it by selling it, giving it away or giving it to charity and so on.

      sister and wants to marry her, however, another brother wants to marry her also but he
      does not want to engage her as yet (Kitbah). because one brother wants to marry the sister
      does that mean that the other brother should stay away?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person has proposed marriage to a woman, it is not
    permitted for anyone else to offer a proposal to her, because of the hadeeth of Ibn
    ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) which states that the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should offer a proposal of marriage
    over the proposal of his brother until the first one gives up or gives him
    permission.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4746).
    There follow quotations from Ibn Hijr’s commentary
    which will shed more light on the matter:
The majority of scholars said: This amounts to a prohibition… The
    Shaafi’is and Hanbalis said: it is prohibited when the woman proposed to, or her
    appointed guardian, has stated that she accepts the offer, but if she has stated that she
    rejects this offer, it is not prohibited. If the second man does not know the situation,
    then he is permitted to propose marriage, because the basic principle is that proposing
    marriage is something permitted… If the woman has not answered either way, it is
    permitted. Al-Tirmidhi reported from al-Shaafi’i that the meaning of the hadeeth is:
    if a man proposes to a woman and she likes him and accepts, no-one else should propose to
    her after that, but if he (the second man) does not know that she liked and accepted that
    proposal, there is nothing wrong with his proposing to her. The evidence for this is the
    story of Faatimah bint Qays, who did not tell (the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him)) that she had accepted the proposal of one (of two men who had
    proposed to her). If she had told him, he would not have advised her to marry someone
    other than the one she had chosen. If there is no word of acceptance or rejection from the
    woman, some of the Shaafi’is say that it is definitely permitted…
    Al-Shaafi’i said that in the case of a virgin, her silence indicates her acceptance
    of a suitor.
The hadeeth was interpretated as meaning that if the first man to propose
    gives permission to the second, it is no longer prohibited for him to propose. … It
    was reported from Ibn al-Qaasim, the companion of Maalik, that if the first suitor is
    immoral, a chaste man is permitted to propose over his proposal. Ibn al-‘Arabi said
    that this was correct… This is applicable if the woman is chaste, because an immoral
    man would not be compatible for her, and his proposal would be like no proposal at all.
The phrase “until he marries her”* means until the first suitor
    has gone ahead and married her, so that anyone else will realize that there is no longer
    any point in proposing; “or gives up” means that the first suitor decides not to
    go ahead, in which case it is permitted for the second to offer his proposal.

What should one do when a dog licks the skin of a person?
I understand that you are supposed to rub soil/mud on to the affected area, but what if the clothing is delicate e.g., a suit and might spoil? Is dry cleaning not enough?","The scholars said that leftover water from which a dog has drunk and the saliva of dogs are impure, and that vessels and garments licked by a dog must be washed seven times, one of them being with earth.","Praise be to Allah.The scholars said that leftover water from which a dog has drunk and the saliva of dogs are impure , and that vessels and garments licked by a dog must be washed. It is reported in the Sunnah how a Muslim should purify these things if that happens.
Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away its contents, then wash it seven times. Muslim added: the first time with earth. (Al-Bukhari bi Hashiyat al-Sindi, 1/44; Muslim, 1/234)
The meaning of the word translated here as lick means if a dog puts its tongue into water, or whatever, regardless of whether or not it actually drinks. The hadith refers to vessels , but the scholars did not distinguish between vessels and other things in this regard. Al-Iraqi said: “Vessels are mentioned because this is the usual scenario.”
The vessel or garment must be washed seven times, one of them being with earth. This is the opinion of Ibn ‘Abbas and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them), according to one report. It was also the opinion of Ibn Sirin, Tawus, al-Awza'i, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Thawr, and others. (Al-Majmoo, 2/586; al-Mughni, 1/46 al-Muhallaa, 1/146; Nayl al-Awtaar, 1/74)
It is not the last washing that has to be done with earth , so there is no room for the objection mentioned in the question that this will make the clothes dirty. The clothes will be washed with water (after the washing with earth), and once they are dried and ironed, they will be cleaner than before.

Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I find some wet coming out. Please don't take it as a wet dream, or urine, because the sticky stuff comes out usually just after I have woken up in the morning. Most of the days I have to wash my underwear just because of that, and sometimes I wash my pants too.
I read somewhere that if it’s not semen, just that sticky stuff then we don't need to perform ghusl, and only wudu is enough to offer prayers. If it is, then what about the clothes? The same stuff comes out during some salacious situations also, though I try to stay away from all that kind of stuff.","Semen in the case of men is a thick, white liquid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow. Madhiy is a sticky white fluid that is emitted when a person is thinking of or desiring intercourse. Maniy requires performance of ghusl, but madhiy requires performance of wudu. Maniy is pure but madhiy is impure.","Praise be to Allah.The difference in qualities between maniy and madhiy
Semen in the case of men is a thick , white liquid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow.
Umm Sulaym (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a woman who sees a dream like a man sees (i.e., an erotic dream). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman sees that, she should do ghusl . Umm Sulaym said: I felt shy when I heard that. She asked, is that possible? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: How else would the child resemble his father or mother? The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow. Whichever of the two prevails or comes first decides which parent the child will resemble.” (Agreed upon. Sahih Muslim, 469)
In his commentary on Sahih Muslim (3/222), Imam al-Nawawi said, concerning the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ‘The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow’: 
“This is an important criterion in describing maniy. This description applies when a person is healthy, and in most cases. The scholars said: when a man is healthy, his semen is white and thick, and gushes out in spurts accompanied by feelings of pleasure. After it has come out, it is followed immediately by a feeling of being drained and exhausted. Its smell is like that of palm tree pollen, which in turn resembles the smell of dough (the colour of semen may change for a number of reasons, including the following): If a person is sick his semen may become thin and yellow, or his testicles may become slack or soft, with the result that the emission of semen is not accompanied by any feelings of pleasure. If a man engages in intercourse too frequently, his semen may become red and resemble the juice that comes from meat, or may even contain pure blood. 
There are three distinguishing features of semen, the presence of any of which is sufficient for it to be classified as semen: firstly, its emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion; secondly, it smells like palm tree pollen, as stated above; and thirdly, it gushes out in spurts. Each one of these three characteristics is sufficient for it to be defined as semen; it is not necessary for all three features to be present. If none of them are present, the substance cannot be described as semen and in all likelihood it is not. All of the above applies to the maniy of men; in the case of women, their maniy is thin and yellow, although it could become white if the woman is strong. It has two distinguishing characteristics, either of which is sufficient to class the substance as maniy: firstly, it smells like the maniy of men, and secondly, its emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion.
Madhiy , on the other hand, is a sticky white fluid that is emitted when a person is thinking of or desiring intercourse. Its emission is not accompanied by feelings of pleasure, it does not gush out in spurts, and it is not followed by exhaustion. This may happen to men and women alike, although it is more common among women. This is the comment of Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on Muslim” (Sharh Muslim, 3/213)
What should be done after emission of maniy and madhiy?
When maniy is emitted, a person must perform ghusl to clean himself from sexual impurity (janabah), whether this happened during intercourse or otherwise, whether he was awake or it happened because of an erotic dream. Madhiy, on the other hand, means that a person only needs to do wudu . The evidence for this is the report of Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I was a man who used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, so I told Miqdad to ask the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it. So he asked him, and he said: It requires wudu. (Agreed upon; this version was narrated by al-Bukhari). Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/168), Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars agree that passing stools or urine, the emission of madhiy or passing wind are all things that invalidate taharah (purity) [i.e. they mean that wudu must be renewed].
Are maniy and madhiy pure?
Maniy is pure according to the most correct opinion among the scholars. The evidence for this is the report of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to wash the maniy (from his clothes) then go out to pray wearing the same clothes, and I could see the spot where he had washed it. (Agreed upon) 
According to a report narrated by Muslim: I used to rub it (semen) thoroughly from the garment of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he would pray in it. According to another version: I would scratch it from his garment with my nail when it had become dry. 
It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to leave it without washing it when it was wet; it was sufficient just to wipe it with ‘oud (a kind of aromatic wood) or something similar, as was reported by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (6/243) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to remove maniy from his garment with a twig of adhkhar (a kind of tree), then pray in that garment, and he would rub it from his garment once it was dry, and would pray in the same garment. Ibn Khuzaymah reported it in his Sahih, and Shaykh al-Albani classed it as hasan in al-Irwa (1/197).
Madhiy (urethral discharge) is impure, because of the Hadith of ‘Ali quoted above, in some versions of which it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to wash his penis and testicles and do wudu, as was reported by Abu Awanah in al-Mustakhraj. Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhis: There is nothing at fault in this isnad. So madhiy is impure and the penis and testicles must be washed, as it nullifies taharah.
Ruling on clothing on which there is maniy and madhiy
As maniy is deemed to be pure, if it gets on a person’s clothes it does not make them impure, and if he prays in those clothes there is nothing wrong with that. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/763): “Even though we say manity is pure , it is better to rub it, but if one prays (in those clothes) without rubbing it, this is acceptable.”
In the case of madhiy, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it , because of the difficulty of doing otherwise. The evidence for this is the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan from Sahl ibn Hanif, who said: I used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, and I used to do ghusl a lot. I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it and he said: It is sufficient for you to do wudu (to purify yourself) from that. I said, O Messenger of Allah, what about when it gets on my clothes? He said: It is sufficient for you to take a handful of water and sprinkle it on your clothes wherever you think (the madhiy) is. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi. He said: This is a sahih hasan Hadith, and the only other Hadith about madhiy that we know is the Hadith of Muhammad ibn Ishaq).
The author of Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (1/373) said: “This may be taken to prove that if madhiy gets on one's clothes, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it; one does not have to wash it.”

Is it allowable for a Muslim woman to greet a Muslim man by shaking hands?",It is not permitted at all for a man to shake hands with a non-Mahram woman.,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted at all for a man to shake hands with a non-Mahram woman . Among the evidence for this is the Hadith of Ma`qal ibn Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `If one of you were to be struck in the head with an iron needle, it would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman he is not allowed to.” (Reported by At-Tabarani; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 5045)
There is no doubt that for a man to touch a non-Mahram woman is one of the causes of Fitnah (turmoil, temptation), provocation of desire and committing prohibited deeds. 
No one should say that their intention is sound or their heart is clean, because the one who was the purest of heart and the most chaste of all, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched a non-Mahram woman, even when accepting Bay`ah (oath of allegiance) from women. He did not hold their hands when accepting their Bay`ah, as he did with men; their Bay`ah was by words only, as was reported by his wife `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). She said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would test the believing women who emigrated to him with the verse  (interpretation of the meaning): “O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the Bay`ah, that they will not associate anything in worship with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (i.e., by making illegal children belong to their husbands), and that they will not disobey you in any Ma`ruf (Islamic monotheism and all that which Islam ordains), then accept their Bay`ah and ask Allah to forgive them. Verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Mumtahinah 60:12] `Aishah said: “So whoever of the believing women agreed to these conditions, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say to her: `I have accepted your Bay`ah by words.` By Allah, his hand never touched the hand of any woman when accepting their Bay`ah; he accepted their Bay`ah by saying `I have accepted your Bay`ah on this basis.`” ((Reported by Al-Bukhari, 4512) 
According to another report, he accepted their Bay`ah by words… the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched the hand of any woman except a woman he owned. (Reported by Al-Bukhari, 6674)
Some Muslims feel too embarrassed to refuse when a woman offers her hand to them. In addition to mixing with women, some of them claim that they are forced to shake hands with fellow-students and teachers in schools and universities, or with colleagues in the workplace, or in business meetings and so on, but this is not an acceptable excuse. 
The Muslim should overcome his own feelings and the promptings of the Shaytan, and be strong in his faith, because Allah is not ashamed of the truth. 
The Muslim could apologize politely and explain that the reason he does not want to shake hands is not to offend or hurt anybody`s feelings, but it is because he is following the teachings of his religion. In most cases this will earn him respect from others. There is no harm done if they find it strange at first, and it may even be a practical opportunity for Da`wah.

    the forgiveness of one who has died?","Question

                My grandmother died 4 years ago (me she be
      in Heaven, Amin). I have grown up in front of her and have great memories of her. She
      taught me to pray and said great and wise things, I have tremendous love for her.
      I foolishly did something that I should not have, for which I am really sorry. I may have
      humiliated her in a way, but she didn't say any thing about it. 
      I haven't had a chance to ask her forgiveness, I have repented to my sin. I constantly ask
      Allah to forgive me. Is there a way to ask my grandmother for forgiveness now? I have
      given great thought to it, but I am unable to come up with any suitable solution.
      I would be grateful if you guide me in this matter.
      I ask Allah for forgiveness and guidance for all who are alive and dead.",,"Praise be to Allah.Since your grandmother has died and gone to her Lord,
    you cannot know whether she has forgiven you or not. There is no way that you can ask for
    her forgiveness now that she has died. This confirms the importance of the hadeeth of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
Whoever has wronged his brother with regard to his honour or
    something, let him ask him for forgiveness before the time when there will be neither dinar
    nor dirham, and if he has any good deeds it will be taken from him in proportion to
    the wrong he did, and if he does not have any good deeds (hasanaat), some of the
    other person's evil deeds (sayiaat) will be taken and given to him to
    bear. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2296).
    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his
    commentary on this hadeeth:
 Whoever has wronged his brother  i.e., if he
    has done something wrong to his brother.
with regard to his honour or something  i.e.,
    anything else this includes all kinds of wealth and wounding, even a slap in the
    face and so on. According to a report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, with regard to his
    honour or his wealth.
Before the time when there will be neither dinar nor dirham
     i.e., the Day of Resurrection.
Some of the other person's evil deeds (sayiaat) will
    be taken  i.e., they will be taken from the account of the person who was
    wronged  and given to him to bear  i.e., they will be added to the
    account of the wrongdoer.
Muslim also narrated a hadeeth similar in meaning to this through a
    different isnaad. This version is clearer in meaning: The one who is bankrupt among
    my ummah is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting and
    zakaah to his credit, but he will come having slandered one person and shed the blood of
    another and wrongfully consumed the wealth of a third, so (his victims) will be given some
    of his hasanaat (good deeds), and if his hasanaat run out before the score is settled,
    some of their sins will be taken and thrown onto him, and he will be thrown into
    Hell.
According to a report also narrated by al-Bukhaari from Abu Hurayrah,
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever
    has done wrong to his brother, let him seek his forgiveness, because in the Hereafter
    there will be no dinar or dirham, and let him ask for his forgiveness before some of his
    hasanaat are taken and given to his brother, and if he has no hasanaat, some of his
    brothers sayiaat will be taken and thrown onto him. (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 6053)
Abu Naeem reported from Ibn Masood that a person will be
    taken by the hand and made to stand before all of mankind, and a caller will cry out:
    This is So and so the son of So and so. Whoever is owed anything by him, let him
    come forward. So they will come forward, and the Lord will say, Give them what
    is due to them. He will say, O Lord, the world is finished, so how can I give
    them anything? He [Allaah] will say to the angels, Take from his righteous
    deeds and give each one what he is asking for. If he is to be saved and there is
    even a mustard-seed worth of his hasanaat left over, Allaah will multiply it until He
    admits him thereby to Paradise.
Ahmad and al-Haakim reported from Jaabir from Abd-Allaah ibn
    Unays, who attributed it to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
    No one of the people of Paradise will be allowed to enter Paradise when one of the
    people of Hell has been wronged by him, until I settle the score, even with regard to a
    slap in the face. We [the Sahaabah] said: O Messenger of Allaah, how will that
    be, when we will be gathered barefoot and naked? He said, By virtue of
    sayiaat and hasanaat. (Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari).
    In any case, you have taken a very important step, which
    is repenting to Allaah. If you sincerely repent to Him and do as much as you can to honour
    your grandmother (for more details, see Question #763), and she sees in her record (on the Day of Judgement) that you
    sought forgiveness for her, perhaps she will forgive you on that Day if she had not
    already forgiven you in this world. Make lots of duaa for her. May Allaah
    forgive us all."

Do more good deeds to expiate your bad deeds and cancel them out, do those things that will help you to remain chaste, and hasten to marry according to Islam. Finally, we will leave you with a story from which you may learn a valuable lesson:
Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him that he had kissed or touched a woman, or something similar, as if he was asking how he could expiate for this (according to another report: a man had done something with a woman that fell short of actual intercourse. He came to `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, who regarded it as something very serious; then he came to Abu Bakr, who regarded it as something very serious. Then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). Then Allah revealed the verse (interpretation of the meaning): And perform prayer at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e., small sins). That is a reminder (advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice). [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, Is this concerning me, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is concerning whoever of my Ummah does this. (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, 4963)
According to a report narrated by Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, O Messenger of Allah, I fondled a woman in the furthest outskirts of Madinah but I did not actually have intercourse with her. Here I am, judge me as you wish. Umar said to him: Allah had covered you, you should have covered yourself (i.e., you should not have spoken of it). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not reply at all, so the man got up and left. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man to follow him, call him and recite to him the verse (interpretation of the meaning): And perform prayer at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e., small sins). That is a reminder (advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice). [Hud 11:114]. A man who was present said: O Prophet of Allah, is this just for him? He said, No, it is for all the people. (Reported by Muslim, 4964)

                There is a custom in some societies for the father to put the condition that he should get something for himself in addition to the mahr which is agreed to for his daughter when she gets married. Does he have the right to this or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ‘Issue: if she gets married on the condition that she will get one thousand and her father will get one thousand, this is permissible, and if she is divorced before the marriage is consummated … the conclusion is that the father of the woman is allowed to put the condition that he will get some part of his daughter’s dowry for himself. This is the opinion of Ishaaq, and it was reported that when Masrooq married his daughter off, he put a condition that he would get ten thousand for himself, which he spent on Hajj and on the poor, then he said to the husband: “Provide your wife with what she needs [e.g., buy her clothes and furnish a house for her].” Something similar was reported from ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn.’
‘Ataa’, Tawoos, ‘Ikrimah, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, al-Thawri and Abu ‘Ubayd said: ‘All of the mahr is for the woman… because the mahr must not be given to anyone but the wife, as a compensation for intimacy with her…
Our evidence for this is the words of Allaah in the story of Shu’ayb, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning): “He said: ‘I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years…’” [al-Qasas 28:27] Here the father, Shu’ayb, made his employing Moosa to look after his sheep his dowry, which was a condition that he would get something for himself. Moreover, a father has the right to take from the wealth of his child, on the basis of the Prophet’s words, “You and your wealth belong to your father,” and “Your children are among the best of your earnings, so consume from their wealth.” (Reported by Abu Dawood; a similar report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said, a hasan hadeeth). If a father puts the condition that he will get something for himself from the dowry, this means that he will be taking something from his daughter’s wealth, and he has the right to do this… A father has the right to take whatever he wants and leave whatever he wants, and he could take it   with this condition or without it… This is provided that he is not unfair in his taking from his daughter’s wealth; if he is being unfair, then the condition is not valid, and the entire dowry belongs to the bride.’
He also said (may Allaah have mercy on him): ‘Section: If any guardian other than the father, such as the grandfather, brother or (paternal) uncle puts such a condition, it is invalid. This is the opinion of Ahmad, and all the mahr agreed upon belongs to the bride.’"
781,2492,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2492,Disposing of riba income received before one came to know that it is haram,"Question

 
A person used to receive interest on his bank deposits. He later learnt it is forbidden (haram) and ceased to receive interest. Later on, he feels he should give out this money to complete the conditions for his repentance (tawba).
However, there are two problems :
1- He cannot calculate the exact amount of all the money
he previously obtained from bank interests.
2- The savings this person has now, are surely less than what
he obtained from bank interest over the years.
Given the above, please answer the following questions :
1- Is it a condition of this person's tawba to give out the exact equivalent of all the money he received from bank interest ?
2- If the answer to the first question is 'yes', then must he immediately give out any amounts as they become available (after providing basic needs for himself and his family) ?
i.e can this person buy things that are not strictly necessities ('Darooriyyaat' i.e. shelter, food, clothes, medicine, transportation) but that are still important ('haajaat', e.g. computer) ?
3- If the answer to the second part of the previous question is 'no', can this person perform hajj, before giving out the equivalent of this bank interest money, with any amounts that become available ?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Those who eat riba (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan, leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like riba, whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire they will abide therein.
[al-Baqarah 2:275]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said concerning the phrase So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past: This means: whoever hears that Allah has forbidden riba should stop as soon as this ruling reaches him, but he can keep whatever he had received before, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Allah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95]. Similarly, on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: All riba owing from the time of Jaahiliyyah is under these two feet of mine (when he abolished everything that was owed to the usurers except their capital), he did not command them to return the extra money they had received during the time of Jaahiliyyah. (The phrase) (Allah) has forgiven what is past is akin to the phrase his case is for Allah (to judge). Saeed ibn Jubayr and al-Saddi said: Shall not be punished for his past (means) for what he used to consume of riba before it was prohibited.
(Tafseer Ibn Katheer; the material in brackets has been added for the purpose of clarification).
On the basis of the above, you do not have to repay the interest which you received before you found out that it is haram, but whatever you have received since then must be repaid if you still have it. If it has become mixed with your own money and you do not know the amount, then try to estimate what you think is most likely, and pay that amount.

                Is the ta'wuth and basmalah (seeking refuge
      in the name of Allah from the Shaitan and saying bismillah), are they part of the opening
      du'a? So If someone is praying behind the Imam should he say them quietly? Should he
      repeat the Bismillah in every raka'ah quietly if he is praying behind the Imam?",,"Praise be to Allah.The istiaadaha and basmalah are not part of the opening
    duaa reported from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him), although they are part of what should be recited at the beginning of the prayer.
    Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to open his prayer with takbeer
    (Allaahu akbar). (Reported by Muslim, no. 498)
    As regards saying the istiaadhah and basmalah in
    the second rakah, the scholars differ on this matter. The basmalah should be recited
    in every rakah, when reciting al-Faatihah, but it should not be recited
    aloud, because there is some dispute as to whether it is part of al-Faatihah or not. Those
    scholars who say that it is not part of al-Faatihah recommend that it should be recited
    before al-Faatihah in each rakah.
So to be on the safe side, the worshipper should recite the basmalah,
    silently, in every rakah.
With regard to the istiaadhah, there is no difference among the
    scholars, all of whom say that it is not part of Soorat al-Faatihah, but there is some
    discussion among them concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): So
    when you want to recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allaah [al-Nahl
    16:98]
Those who take the aayah at face value say that the istiaadhah
    should be recited in every rakah, before reciting al-Faatihah and the basmalah. This
    is the opinion of the Shaafais and is the most correct opinion in their view. (Al-Majmoo,
    3/323). Al-Hasan al-Basri, Ataa and Ibraaheem al-Nakhai
    also recommended taawwudh in every rakah.
    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured this opinion, and it
    was also reported that Imaam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on
    him) mentioned it in Aadaab al-Mashiy ilal-Salaah. This opinion was also
    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) (al-Insaaf
    2/74), who said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat: Taawwudh is
    recommended at the beginning of every recitation. (p.50). This is also the opinion
    of al-Allaamah al-Albaani.
    Some scholars say that it is to be recited at the beginning of the
    first rakah only, and does not have to be repeated in the other rakahs. This
    is the opinion of the Hanbalis (al-Insaaf, 2/73).
    Al-Shawkaani thought that the correct opinion was to recite it in the first rakah
    only. (Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/39, 139-140).
    The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to
    seek refuge with Allaah when he prayed. He used to say Aoodhu Billaahi min
    al-shaytaan il-rajeem min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathih (I seek refuge with Allaah
    from the accursed Shaytaan, from his evil insinuations). (reported by Abu
    Dawood). Sometimes he would expand on this and say, Aoodhu
    Billaahi il-Samee il-Aleem min al-shaytaan il-rajeem min hamzihi wa
    nafkhihi wa nafathih (I seek refuge with Allaah, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, from
    the accursed Shaytaan, from his evil insinuations). (Reported by Abu Dawood

    depending on whether the word is used alone or is accompanied by the word tawbah

    The two words are interchangeable, each carrying the meaning of the other, when mentioned

What is the role of Islam regarding hejab muslim women infront of non muslim women ,and is it allowed for non muslim women to cut muslim women's hair?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says about the Muslim womans hijaab (interpretation of the meaning): and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, their husbands sons, their brothers or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women [al-Noor 24:31]
The scholars differ as to whether kaafir women are included in the phrase or their women. The aayah gives Muslim women permission to remove their hijaab in front of their women. Some scholars say that the pronoun hinna (their) is referring to specific people, otherwise there would be no need to be so specific. Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, Or their women means the Muslim women it excludes the mushrik women whether they are of ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living peacefully under Islamic rule) or others. It is not permitted for a believing woman to uncover any of her body in front of a mushrik woman unless she is a slave belonging to her.
(Al-Jaami li Ahkaam al-Quran, 12/233). Ibn Katheer said something similar in his Tafseer.
This is the opinion of the Hanafis, Maalikis and Shaafais, and is one of two opinions narrated from Imaam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him. Some of the scholars thought that the pronoun in the phrase or their women did not mean that Muslim women should take off their hijaab in front of Muslim women but not mushrik and kaafir women. This is the correct view of the Hanbalis. They said: The phrase or their women applies to all women, and the pronoun hinna was added because of the context and pattern of the passage, which mentions their fathers, their sons, etc. So the pronoun is added to make this word match the others.
The majority of scholars say that it is forbidden for a kaafir woman to look at a Muslim woman without hijaab, and this is the most correct interpretation of the aayah. If all women were meant, the aayah would have read or the women (in general), but what it actually says is or their women. There is no word or phrase in the Quran that does not carry a specific meaning, and there is no evidence to support the idea that the pronoun is only there to make the word match the pattern of the rest of the passage.

787,2521,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2521,Is It Haram to Be Vegan?,"Question

I'm vegan, I mean I do not eat any meat product or dairy from milk, eggs, cheese, or honey, any thing that have to do with animal I just I don't eat it, and the thing is that I like the religion ofnIslam and I would like to be a part of it. So my question is: can I be a Muslim and still don't eat meat and animal products? Thank you so much.",It is not haram to be vegan by not eating animal products as long as you do not think that these things are haram or that it is better to abstain from these foods.,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, you can be a Muslim without eating these animal products, but you need to be aware of the following:

You should not think that these things are haram (forbidden), because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):

“O you who believe! Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good as regards foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons, etc.) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.” [Al-Maidah 5:87]
“Say: who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-tayyibat [all kinds of lawful things] of food? Say: they are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic laws) in detail for people who have knowledge.” [Al-A’araf 7:32]
“Say: Tell me, what provision has Allah sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: Has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?” [Yunus 10:59]

You should not think that it is better to abstain from these foods, or that doing so will be rewarded, or that a vegetarian/vegan is closer to Allah than others, and so on. It is not permitted to draw closer to Allah in this way. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who is the best of mankind and the closest to Allah, used to eat meat and drink milk and honey. When one of his Companions wanted to give up meat, he told him that this was wrong. Anas reported that there was a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), one of whom said, I will never marry women; another said, I will not eat meat; another said, I will not sleep on a bed; and another said, I will fast and never break my fast. News of this reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He praised and thanked Allah, then said: What is wrong with the people who are saying such and such? I pray and I sleep; I fast and I break my fast; and I marry women. Whoever deviates from my Sunnah (way) does not belong to me. (Reported by al-Nasai; the story is also to be found in the two Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim).

There is a great difference between not eating a certain kind of food because one does not like it, or it does not agree with one, or one has been put off for example by seeing an animal slaughtered when one was a child, which may leave one with a distaste for meat and other similar reasons, and thinking that meat is haram and that abstaining from it is an act of worship, as is done by Brahmins, monks and others who are misguided.
Once this matter is clear in your mind, there is nothing wrong with not eating foods that you do not like. We will be happy to welcome you soon as our sister in Islam. We ask Allah to give you the strength to do good and to protect you from every evil. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

  My question pertains to divorce in Islam. 
  I have been married for a year and early on in my marriage I had strong
      and constant thoughts about divorce. The divorce thoughts consisted of my repeating
      ""I divorce you"" on many occasions in my head. I have NEVER repeated these things
      out loud and they were only thoughts in my head. 
    I no longer want to divorce my wife and would like to stay with her. Is it
      possible for divorce to be valid just by repeating the thought in your head? Is it haram
      for us to stay together?
  Please respond as soon as possible as this has been haunting me for the
      past year.",,"Praise be to Allah.In cases like this, the divorce is not valid, for two reasons:
It is only in your mind, and has never been expressed either verbally or
        in writing.

The divorce of a person who is afflicted with waswaas
        (insinuating thoughts from Shaytaan) is not valid because this is something that he has no
        control over, and it carries no weight in sharee’ah.

I have read in your anwers that you tell muslim that the woman should be chaste. Is this only with jew or christian girl or also, muslim woman? Does touching and kisssing are included when you refer to chastidy? What should be the advice given to a muslim boy that thinks touching is necessary before marriage?
I appreciate this to be confidencial. Thanks so much for helping me.",,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Jareer al-Tabari gave a definition of muhsanah in Jaami’ al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi’l-Qur’aan (8/165):
“Muhsanah means the woman who is chaste and pure … one who is chaste and protects her private parts from committing immoral acts, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imraan, who guarded her chastity…’ [al-Tahreem 66:12], meaning that she kept herself above suspicious actions and protected herself from immoral conduct.”
Then he discussed the interpretation of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’ [al-Maa’idah 5:5]
He said that some others said that what was meant by this aayah (‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’) is chaste women from both groups, whether they were slaves or free. Those who were of this opinion considered it permissible to marry slave women who were Jews or Christians who practised their religions, because of this aayah, but they considered it haraam to marry promiscuous women, whether they were Muslims or from the People of the Book. Then he mentioned reports to support this opinion.
He also said: ‘There was some dispute among the scholars about the interpretation of the phrase and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…- was this general or specific in application? Some said that it is general and applies to all chaste women, because muhsanaat means chaste women, and a Muslim is allowed to marry any woman of the People of the Book, free or slave, from a country whose people are engaged in hostilities with Islam or from a community which is living under Islamic rule. They use as evidence for this the apparent meaning of the phrase and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time… - taking muhsanaat to mean any chaste woman, whoever she may be. This is the opinion of those who take muhsanaat to mean “chaste women” in this context.
Others say that it refers only to the women of Jewish and Christian communities who are living under Islamic rule. As regards those living in regions that are hostile to Islam, Muslims are not permitted to marry such women.
He mentions an important condition for marrying a woman of the People of the Book, which every Muslim who wants to marry such a woman in a non-Muslim country should pay attention to. This condition is that he should be in a position where he is not afraid that his child will be forced into kufr.
One of the obvious implications of this in our time is that a Muslim should not put himself in a position where he will be forced to raise his child as a kaafir in a non-Muslim country, where a child may be forced to study something about Christianity, for example, or he may be taken to church on Sundays, or the law may be on the side of the non-Muslim woman, allowing her to take her child wherever she wants and raise him in her family’s religion, etc. We ask Allaah to keep us safe from all that and we seek refuge with Him from being forsaken.
Shaykh al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (commentary on the Qur’aan), 1/458:
“‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women – i.e., free and chaste - from the believers and chaste women –free and chaste - from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’ i.e., from among the Jews and Christians. This is adding specific details to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And do not marry al-mushrikaat (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship Allaah alone)…’ [al-Baqarah 2:221].”
As for promiscuous women, those who do not keep themselves chaste and free from immoral sexual conduct, it is not permitted to marry them, whether they are Muslims or from among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), unless they repent, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Noor 24:3]

                In the Name Of God Most Gracious and
      Merciful.
   Salam elkum.
First I would really like to commend you on the substantial information
      you have provided to the public. May God reward you all on your efforts. I do realize that
      every single question cannot be answered directly. However, I have done a lot of research
      on this matter and still I have come up with no answers to my question. What makes it even
      more difficult is the lack of knowledge of Islam from my parents perspective. I was born
      in Canada and one of the very few young teenage girls fighting to learn more about Islam.
      Unfortunatly, there is still a lot I do not know about our religion, yet I work at it
      every day.
    Getting down to my problem, I am 19 years old and just got engaged to a Lebanese Muslim fellow. After getting engaged to this person I found
      out that in the past he has been with other girls and intimate relationships, before
      marriage. Of course, I realize that in our religon that is very wrong. Now I am left with
      the decision of whether to go ahead and get married to this person or not. I personally
      think that I shouldn't be with a person who has done such things while my family says
      forgive and forget... However, I would like your opinion on this matter. Is it ideal and
      acceptable for someone like myself to marry a person of this nature even if it was his
      past.
    Thank you so much for your time . I would appreciate it if you had a
      chance to reply it would fill up so many unanswered questions but of course I fully
      understand if you cannot do so .
      It is very difficult for me to learn more about Islam sometimes books
      don't fully answer my questions. Thanks again kindly for your time .",,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, may Allaah reward you with good for your kind words. We
    apologize for not answering questions in full. With regard to your question about this man
    who has asked for your hand in marriage, what you should concentrate on is the way he is
    now: is he doing his religious duties, like the five daily prayers, etc., is he keeping
    away from haraam things, has he repented for what he did in the past? Or not? If he is
    keeping his duty towards Allaah, then this is the good commitment to religion that is
    required according to the command of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him): If there comes to you with an offer of marriage (for your daughter,
    sister, etc.) one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then
    marry (your daughter, sister, etc, to) him. If you do not do so, there will be mischief on
    earth and widespread corruption. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1004; classed as
    hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 270)
    It is not permitted to bring up the past of a person who
    regrets it and has repented and given up his sin; rather, this should be covered up.
    Whoever covers up his Muslim brother in this world, Allaah will cover him up in the
    Hereafter. (A saheeh hadeeth reported by Imaam Ahmad; Saheeh
    al-Jaami, 6287)
    But if a person is immoral and corrupt, and still has
    relationships from before, then you should never, ever agree to marry him. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a
    mushrikah. And the woman who agrees to marry a mushrik or an adulterer, then she is either
    a prostitute or a mushrikah. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers. [al-Noor
    24:3]
Ibn Katheer said, commenting on the phrase Such a thing is forbidden
    to the believers: i.e., (it is forbidden for) a man to marry an immoral woman,
    or for a chaste woman to marry an immoral man. Hence Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said that the
    marriage contract between a chaste man and an immoral woman is invalid, so long as she
    remains like this, unless she is asked to repent and she does so, in which case the
    contract becomes valid, otherwise it is not valid. Similarly, the marriage of a free,
    chaste woman to a promiscuous, immoral man is invalid unless he repents sincerely, because
    Allaah says Such a thing is forbidden to the believers. 
There is no secret about the mischief, misery and problems that result
    from marriage to an immoral man.
In many cases it is very difficult to get a true picture of a person
    and be sure about whether he is chaste or otherwise. But by researching, asking questions,
    consulting people and asking them for advice, whilst taking ones time and asking
    Allaah for help, one can get answers. We ask Allaah to choose the best for you, to help
    you and to guide you. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

Have I heard correctly that your rules of modesty require men to crouch or squat to urinate? I am wondering if it would be more polite not to use the urinal in a men's room if someone who I believe is Muslim is nearby at the wash basin. I know that for women the modesty laws are a lot stricter than for most Western women, and I respect Islamic women very much for that. I also don't want to offend Muslims if there is some way I may be acting in an immodest way, unknowingly, around them. Thank you in advance for your answer and may the blessings of health and peace attend you.","Muslim bathroom etiquette includes: not facing the qiblah, not touching the penis with the right hand, not removing impurity with the right hand, answering the call of nature sitting, concealing oneself from the sight of others, reciting dhikr when entering or leaving the toilet, and not urinating into stagnant water.","Praise be to Allah.First of all, we must thank you for your concern about the feelings of Muslims and your efforts to find out what may offend them so that you may avoid it. We are happy to provide you with a detailed answer to your question and more, in the hope that it may open the way to great good for you.
Among the signs of the greatness of the blessed Islamic Shari`ah is the fact that there is no good thing, major or minor, that it has not commanded us to do or pointed the way to it, and there is no bad thing, major or minor, that it has not warned us against or forbidden. 
The Shari`ah is perfect and complete in all aspects, a fact which has often greatly astonished non-Muslims and earned their admiration. 
At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), one of the polytheists said to the Prophet’s Companion, Salman al-Farsi (may Allah be pleased with him),: Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to defecate! Salman said: Yes, he forbade us to face the qiblah when urinating or defecating (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 16; he said it is a sahih hasan hadith; also reported in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere). 
Islamic Shari`ah includes a number of rules and manners to be followed when answering the call of nature, including the following:

Not to face the qiblah (direction of prayer, i.e. the Ka`bah which was built in Makkah by Ibrahim, upon whom be peace, as commanded by Allah) when urinating or defecating. This is out of respect for the Qiblah and for the symbols and rituals of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you sits down to answer the call of nature, he should not face the qiblah or turn his back towards it. ( Muslim, 389)
He should not touch his penis with his right hand when urinating, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you urinates, he should not hold his penis in his right hand or clean it with his right hand; and (when drinking), he should not breathe into the vessel. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 150)
He should not remove impurity with his right hand; the left hand should be used for this purpose, because of the hadith quoted above, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you wipes himself, he should not use his right hand. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5199)

The Prophet’s wife, Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her), reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use his right hand for eating, drinking, making wudu, getting dressed, and giving and taking things, and he used to use his left hand for other things. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4912 
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you cleans himself, he should not use his right hand, he should use his left hand. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 308; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 322)

The Sunnah is to answer the call of nature sitting, making oneself close to the ground, because this is more concealing, and makes it less likely that spray from one's urine will come back on one's body or clothes, making them dirty. If a person can be sure of avoiding this, then it is permissible to urinate standing up .
A person should be concealed from the sight of others when answering the call of nature. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to prefer to go behind a rise in the ground or a garden of date palms. (Reported by Muslim, 517)

If a person is out in an open space and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call of nature, he should move far away from the other people around him, because al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a journey, when he felt the need to answer the call of nature, so he went far away. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 20; he said it is a sahih hasan hadith)
‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Qurad said: I went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to an open space, and when he needed to answer the call of nature, he moved away. (Reported by al-Nasai, 16; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4651)

A person should not uncover his `awrah (private parts) until after he has squatted close to the ground, because this is more concealing, as Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature, he would not lift his garment until he had squatted close to the ground. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 14; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4652)

If a person is in a (modern) toilet, he should not lift his garment until he has closed the door and is out of sight of other people. 
With regard to this point and the one before, it is worth noting that the habit of many people in the West and elsewhere, of urinating in a standing position in front of other people in public toilets (using urinals) is something which goes against good manners, modesty and decency, and is repulsive to anyone who possesses sound common sense and wisdom. How can anybody uncover in front of other people the `awrah (private parts) which Allah has placed between his legs to conceal it and commanded him to cover it? The idea that it should be covered is well established among all wise and decent people of all races. It is wrong in principle to build restrooms of this shameful type, where the users can see one another, thus making them worse than some kinds of animals whose habit is to conceal themselves from one another when urinating or defecating.

It is also good manners according to Shari`ah to recite certain adhkar (supplications) when entering or leaving the toilet , which are quite appropriate to the situation and place. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that when entering the toilet, we should say: Allahumma inni a’udhi bika min al-khubthi wal-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from male and female devils). When leaving the toilet, he should say: Ghufranak (I seek Your forgiveness).
He should be careful to remove all impurity after answering the call of nature, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against being careless in cleaning oneself after urinating : Most of the punishment of the grave will be because of urine. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 342; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 1202)

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves, and said: They are being punished, but they are not being punished for any major sin. One of them used not to protect himself (i.e. keep himself clean from) his urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious gossip. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5592)

Any impurity should be washed or wiped three times or an odd number of times greater than three, according to whatever is needed to cleanse it, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to wash his posterior three times. Ibn ‘Umar said: We did this too and found it to be healing and cleansing. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 350; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4993) Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When anyone of you cleans himself (with stones or similar material) let him use an odd number. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jami’, 375)
He should not use bones or dung to clean himself or wipe away the impurity, rather, he should use tissue, stones, and the like. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he used to carry a vessel for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to do wudu and clean himself after answering the call of nature. Whilst he was following him, he (the Prophet) asked, Who is that? He said: I am Abu Hurayrah. He said: Get me some stones I can use to clean myself, but do not bring me any bones or dung. So I brought him some stones, carrying them in the hem of my garment, and placed them by his side, then I went away. When he had finished, I came back and asked him, What is wrong with bones and dung? He said: They are the food of the jinn. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3571)
A person should not urinate into stagnant water, because Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade anyone to urinate into stagnant water (reported by Muslim, 423), and because this makes the water impure and harms those who use it.
A person should not urinate by the roadside or in places where people seek shade, because this is offensive to them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Fear the two things that bring curses. They asked, What are the two things that bring curses, O Messenger of Allah? He said: When a person relieves himself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 23; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 110)
One should not greet a person who is answering the call of nature , or return a greeting whilst one is answering the call of nature, out of respect to Allah by not mentioning His name in a dirty place . Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah reported that a man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating, and greeted him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: If you see me in this state, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 346; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 575) The majority of scholars say that it is makruh (disliked) to speak in the restroom unnecessarily.

These are some of the rules and manners prescribed by the Shari`ah of Islam in this matter which is repeated many times a day by every person. If the Shari`ah has paid such minute attention to the details of such a mundane matter, what do you think it has to say about more important issues? Do you know of any other religion or system in the world that has brought laws like this? This is enough, by Allah, to prove its perfection and beauty, and the necessity of following it. We ask Allah to give us and you strength and to guide us all to the truth. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

Please answer soon; I hope to go for an Umrah in the near future and visit his grave too, insya Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Daaraqutni reported in his Sunan (2/278) with an isnaad from Haatib that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits me after I die, it is as if he visited me when I was still alive…” This is a hadith which many of the scholars of hadith judged to be false and not to have been reported with a saheeh isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Among the scholars who voiced this opinion was al-Haafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisaan al-Meezaan (4/285), in his biography of one of the narrators, Haaroon ibn Abi Qaz’ah. Al-Dhahabi said: “…Haaroon ibn Abi Qaz’ah al-Madani [reported] from a man” – about visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Al-Bukhari said: “This is not to be accepted or followed.”
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Lisaan al-Meezaan (6/217): “Al-Azdi said: ‘Haaroon Abu Qaz’ah reports mursal ahadith from a man of Aal Haatib.’ I [Ibn Hajar] say: from this we understand that what he is referring to is al-Azdi. Ya’qoob ibn Shaybah also classed him as da’eef (weak).”
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar also mentioned him in al-Talkhees al-Habeer, in his comment on the ahadith of al-Raafa’i al-Kabeer (2/266). He said, “In his isnaad is the unknown [majhool] man” – meaning a man from Aal Haatib.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in al-Tawassul wa’l-Waseelah (p. 134) about this hadith: “It is obviously a lie that goes against Islam. Anyone who visited him during his lifetime and believed in him, was one of his Companions, especially if he was among those who migrated to join him or fought alongside him. It is proven that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not slander my Companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to spend gold equal to the size of Uhud, it would not equal the deeds of one of them, not even half of it.’
[Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim]. Anyone who comes after the Sahaabah cannot be like the Sahaabah by doing obligatory duties such as Hajj, jihaad, the five daily prayers and sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so how can he become equal to them by doing something that is not obligatory according to the consensus of the Muslims? We are not even supposed to travel for this purpose, in fact it is forbidden to do so. However, travelling to the [Prophet’s] Mosque, and to al-Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem], for the purpose of praying there, is mustahabb (encouraged), and travelling to the Ka’bah for Hajj is waajib (obligatory). If a person who undertakes a journey that is waajib or mustahabb still cannot be like one of the Sahaabah who travelled to visit the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his lifetime, how can they achieve this by undertaking a journey that is not allowed?”
He also said (p. 133): “All of the ahadith about visiting his grave are da’eef, and are not to be relied upon in matters of religion. For this reason none of the authors of books of Saheeh and Sunan reported them at all; they were only narrated by those who reported da’eef ahadith, such as al-Daaraqutni, al-Bazzaar and others.
Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Da’eefah (no. 1021) about this hadith: it is baatil (false). He mentioned what is wrong with the hadith, namely the man who is not named, and classed Haaroon Abu Qaz’ah as da’eef. There is a third fault with the hadith, which is that it causes confusion and contradiction. Then Shaykh al-Albaani said: “In general, the isnaad of this hadith is weak.”
He also said in al-Da’eefah (no. 47): “many people think that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and those who follow him among the Salafis forbid visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) altogether. This is a lie and a fabrication, and it is not the only lie told about Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him, or about the Salafis. Everyone who reads the books of Ibn Taymiyah will see that he says it is permissible to visit his grave (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that doing so is recommended (mustahabb), so long as it is not associated with any objectionable practices or innovations (bid’ah), such as travelling solely for that purpose, because of the hadith “No one should set out purposely except to visit three mosques.” The hadith does not describe a ban only on travelling to visit other mosques, as many people think; it also includes a ban on setting out to visit any place which people think will bring them closer to Allah, whether it is a mosque, a grave or any other place. This is indicated by the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah who said: ‘I met Basrah ibn Abi Basrah al-Ghifaari and he asked me, ‘Where are you coming from?’ I said, ‘From al-Toor [Sinai].’ He said, ‘If I had met you before you left, you would not have gone there! I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Do not travel except to three mosques.’”
(Reported by Ahmad and others with a saheeh isnaad).
This clearly indicates that the Sahaabah understood the hadith to be general in application [i.e., it did not apply only to mosques]. This is supported by the fact that it is not reported that any of them ever set out with the intention of visiting a grave. They are the predecessors of Ibn Taymiyah in this regard, so whoever condemns Ibn Taymiyah is in effect condemning the salaf (the righteous predecessors), may Allah be pleased with them. May Allah have mercy on the one who said:
“All goodness is in following those who went before (the salaf)
and all evil is in following the innovations of those who came later.”
In conclusion, travelling with the intention of visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is bid’ah and is haraam, because of the hadith which forbids travelling to worship in any place except the three mosques. As for visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when one happens to be in Madeenah, this is perfectly acceptable, as is travelling with the intention of praying in the Prophet’s Mosque as an act of worship and seeking to draw close to Allah. Those that are confused about this issue are those who do not understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden.

The internet has a website on interpretation of dreams and me being kidnapped means that I will be put in an embarrassing situation and the hug from my aunt means that I will lose my lover.  Is this true? Can you please comment?","Astrology, horoscopes, superstition and fortune-telling are all actions of ignorance which Islam came to show as false and to explain that they are acts of polytheism.","Praise be to Allah.Are horoscopes haram?
Astrology , horoscopes, superstition and fortune-telling are all actions of ignorance which Islam came to show as false and to explain that they are acts of polytheism. This is because they involve depending on something other than Allah and believing that benefit and harm come from something other than Him, and believing the words of fortune-tellers and soothsayers who falsely claim to have knowledge of the unseen in order to cheat people of their money and change their beliefs. 
Evidence for prohibiting zodiac signs in Islam
The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan with a sahih isnad from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns anything of astrology has learned a branch of witchcraft (al-sihr)…” 
Al-Bazzar narrated with a sound chain of transmission from ‘Imran ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who practises augury or has it done for him, who tells fortunes or has his fortune told, or who practises witchcraft or has that done for him.” Whoever claims to know some matter of the unseen either is a fortune-teller or is acting like a fortune-teller in some sense, because Allah is the only One Who has knowledge of the unseen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“Say: ‘None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allah…’” [al-Naml 27:65]
How to avoid fortune-telling
My advice to everyone who has anything to do with these matters is to repent to Allah and ask for His forgiveness, and to depend only on Allah and to put their trust in Him in all their affairs, whilst following the practical means that are prescribed or permitted in shari’ah. They should give up these matters of jahiliyyah, keep away from them and avoid asking the people who practise them or believe what they say, out of obedience to AllahAllah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of AllahAllah be upon him), and in order to protect his commitment to Islam and his ‘aqidah (religious belief).

     Please help me to understand. I need to know the meaning of the following
      Hadith:
Narrated Abu Huraira:
   The Prophet said (PBUH) (that ALLAH said), ""Vowing does not bring to
      the son of Adam anything I have 
     not already written in his fate, but vowing is imposed on him by way of
      fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his wealth""

      also sent you a question asking you to please explain the meanings
  of some of the Surahs and ayats that we are supposed to pray. The
      reference number 2241. Is it possible for you to please answer that question.
   May ALLAh guide and protect you for your kindness and help and may he
      bless our Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ,Wassalam.",,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth you mention was narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have
    mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said (that Allaah said): “Vowing does not bring
    to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments),
    but vowing is imposed on him by way of preordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend
    of his wealth.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 6119)
Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this
    hadeeth:
“Ibn ‘Umar said: ‘The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) forbade the making of vows.’ … A clear statement prohibiting
    vows came in the report of al-‘Alaa’ ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan from his father
    from Abu Hurayrah, recorded by Muslim in the words ‘Do not make vows,’ and in
    the phrase ‘(Making vows) does not bring forward anything or delay anything [i.e., it
    has no effect whatsoever],’ and in the report of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Murrah,
    ‘It does not change anything,’ – which is more general. A similar phrase
    was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: ‘Vowing does not bring to the son of
    Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments)…’
    Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah: ‘The point of the hadeeth is that he told
    them that this thing (making vows) does not bring any immediate benefit or turn away any
    immediate harm, and it does not change what has been decreed. Thus he said, Do not make
    vows, as you know that you cannot get, or turn away, anything by means of vows that Allaah
    has not already decreed for you. If you make a vow then fulfill it, because whatever you
    have vowed becomes obligatory for you.’ (Then Ibn Hajar quotes the opinions of a
    number of scholars on the reason why making vows is prohibited): … The reason may be
    that the person who makes a vow does not do so in order to draw closer to Allaah, but will
    only do so if he gets what he wanted, as if this is an exchange, which corrupts his
    intention to draw closer to Allaah. This interpretation is indicated by the words,
    ‘It does not bring any good,’ and ‘Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam
    anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments).’ This is a
    clear statement as to why vows should not be made. The phrase ‘it does not bring any
    good’ means that the end result will be no good, and it might be too difficult to
    fulfil the vow, or it might mean that (the vow) will not bring about good if it has not
    been decreed for him…. Al-Nawawi said: ‘The phrase “it does not bring any
    good” means that it will not stop anything that has already been decreed, as is clear
    from the other reports.’ … (Then Ibn Hajar quotes from Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed),
    saying that he described the difference between nadhr al-mujaazaah (vow of
    repayment, one in which an act of worship is promised in return for a favour), which is
    forbidden, and nadhr al-ibtidaa’ (vow of initiative, where one does the
    promised act of worship first, without waiting to see if the favour is granted or not),
    which is a pure act of worship.”
In al-Mufahhim, al-Qurtubi confirmed the idea that the ahaadeeth
    forbid nadhr al-mujaazaah: ‘This refers to a situation where a man might say,
    for example, “If Allaah heals this person who is sick, I will give such-and-such in
    charity.” The reason why it is disliked is that he postpones doing the act of worship
    mentioned, and makes it conditional upon getting the desired result. This makes it quite
    clear that he does not have the sincere intention of drawing closer to Allaah, because he
    has clearly stated that his approach is that of giving something in return for something.
    It is quite clear that if the sick person is not healed, he will not give the charity
    which is conditional upon the sick person’s recovery. This is the attitude of the
    miser, who does not give anything of his wealth except in exchange for some immediate
    return, usually something that is worth more than what he is prepared to give. This is
    what is referred to in the hadeeth: “Through vowing I make a miser spend of his
    wealth.” To this could be added the point that there is an ignorant belief that
    making a vow guarantees that one will get the desired result, or that Allaah will do what
    a person wants because of the vow. Both notions are addressed in the hadeeth: “Vowing
    does not bring to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar
    (preordainments).”’ Concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They
    (are those who) fulfil (their) vows…” [al-Insaan 76:7] al-Tabaraani reported
    with a saheeh isnaad that Qutaadah said: “They used to vow to do acts of worship such
    as praying, fasting, giving zakaat and going on pilgrimage (Hajj and ‘Umrah), and
    other acts which were obligatory for them, and so Allaah called them abraar (those
    who are pious, fear Allaah, and avoid evil – see al-Insaan 76:5). It is clear
    that it is not those who make vows of repayment (nadhr al-mujaazaah) who are
    praised…”
Al-Baydaawi said: “People usually make vows conditional upon gaining
    some benefit or removing some evil, and this is forbidden because it is the way of the
    miser. If a generous person wants to draw closer to Allaah, he starts doing good deeds
    straight away, but the miser would never voluntarily give anything except in return for
    something which he is given first. This attitude will not protect him from anything that
    has already been decreed, or bring him any good thing that has not been decreed for him.
    The vow will be in accordance with qadar and will make him give something that he would
    not have given otherwise… And Allaah knows best.”"

Is it permissible to read the Quran while a woman is having menses (periods)?","1- The majority of jurists say that a woman cannot read the Quran during her period until she is pure. However, some scholars say that it is permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the Quran.
2- As for touching the Quran during menses, the correct view is that it is forbidden to touch the mus-haf when one is in any kind of state of impurity.","Praise be to Allah.Reading the Quran during menses
Reading the Quran during menses is one of the issues on which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, differed.
The majority of fuqaha say that it is haram for a woman to recite Quran during her period, until she is tahir (pure) again. The only exceptions they make is in the case of dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and phrases that are not intended as tilawah (recitation), such as saying “Bismillahi’r-Rahmani’r-Rahim” or “Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un”, or other phrases from the Quran which are repeated as general du’as.
Evidence for forbidding women from reading the Quran during menses
They base their evidence for forbidding menstruating women to recite Quran on several things, including the following:
1- Menstruation is seen as coming under the rulings that apply to one who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual intercourse), because both states require ghusl. This is based on the hadith narrated by ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach the Quran and he never prevented anyone from learning it except those who were in a state of janabah (major ritual impurity).” (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/281; al-Tirmidhi, 146; al-Nasai, 1/144; Ibn Majah, 1/207; Ahmad, 1/84; Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/104. Al-Tirmidhi said: a sahih hasan hadith. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: the truth is that it is the type of hasan hadith that could be used as evidence).
2- The hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of major ritual impurity (janabah) should not recite anything of the Quran.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 131; Ibn Majah, 595; al-Daraqutni (1/117); al-Bayhaqi, 1/89. This is a da’if hadith, because it was reported by Isma’il ibn ‘Ayyash from the Hijazis, and his reports from them are da’if as is well known to those who are conversant with the study of hadith. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said (21/460): it is a da’if hadith by the unanimous agreement of the scholars of hadith. See Nasb al-Rayah, 1/195; al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/183).
Evidence for allowing women to read the Quran during menses
Some scholars say that it is permitted for a menstruating woman to recite Quran. This is the opinion of Malik, and one opinion narrated from Ahmad, which Ibn Taymiyah preferred and which al-Shawkani believed to be correct. The scholars based the following points on this opinion:
1- The principle is that things are allowed and permitted unless there is evidence to the contrary. There is no such evidence to say that a menstruating woman is not allowed to recite Quran. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “There is no clear, sahih text to indicate that a menstruating woman is forbidden to recite Quran… It is known that women used to menstruate at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid them to recite Quran, or to remember Allah (dhikr) and offer du’a.”
2- Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, commands (Muslims) to recite Quran. He praises the one who does so, and promises him (or her) a great reward. No one is excluded from this except the one concerning whom there is solid evidence (dalil), and there is no such evidence in the case of menstruating women, as stated above.
3- The analogy between the menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of janabah is made despite the fact that there are differences between them. The one who is in a state of janabah has the option of removing the “barrier” by making ghusl, unlike the menstruating woman. A woman’s period usually lasts for some length of time, whereas the person who is in a state of janabah is required to do ghusl when the time for prayer comes.
4- Preventing a menstruating woman from reciting Quran deprives her of the chance to earn reward, and it may make her forget something of the Quran, or she may need to recite it for the purposes of teaching or learning.
From the above, it is clear that the evidence of those who allow a menstruating woman to recite Quran is stronger. If a woman wants to err on the side of caution, she can limit her recitation to the passages which she is afraid of forgetting.
Touching the Quran during menses 
It is very important to note that what we have been discussing here is restricted to what a menstruating woman recites from memory. When it comes to reading from the Mus-haf (the Arabic text itself), a different rule applies. 
The correct view of the scholars is that it is forbidden to touch the mus-haf when one is in any kind of state of impurity, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… which none can touch except the purified.” [al-Waqi’ah 56:79]
In a letter to ‘Amr ibn Hazm, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the people of Yemen: “No one should touch the Quran except one who is tahir (pure).” 
The hadith is reported by Malik, 1/199; al-Nasai, 8/57; Ibn Hibban, 793; al-Bayhaqi, 1/87. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: A group of scholars classed this hadith as sahih because it is so well known. Al-Shafi'i said: It is proven by them that it was a letter sent by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “This letter is famous among the scholars of sirah, and is so well known among the scholars that it does not need an isnad. It is like tawatur because the people accepted and recognized it. Shaykh al-Albani said that it is sahih. Al-Talkhis al-Habir, 4/17. See also: Nasb al-Rayah, 1/196; Irwa al-Ghalil, 1/158).
(Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 1/159; al-Majmu’, 1/356; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 1/147; al-Mughni, 3/461; Nayl al-Awtar, 1/226; Majmi’ al-Fatawa, 21/460; al-Sharh al-Mumti’ li’l-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/291)

802,2570,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2570,Does Blood Donation Break Wudu?,"Question

Can a Muslim donate blood, and if so can he offer prayer straight after donating blood?","It is preferable for a blood donor to do wudu after giving blood, but if he does not do wudu, it is still OK.","Praise be to Allah.Is blood donation halal?
If it is necessary to carry out a blood transfusion , there is no sin on the patient, the doctors or the donor, because of the following:
1.      Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind…” [al-Maidah 5:32]. 
This verse indicates the virtue of being the cause of saving the life of someone whom it is forbidden to kill, and there is no doubt that the doctors and blood donors are among the causes of saving the life of patients who are at risk of dying if a blood transfusion is not carried out.
2.                Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you only the dead animals, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Baqarah 2:173]. 
This verse indicates that there is no sin on the one who does a forbidden thing out of necessity; the sick person accepts a blood transfusion out of necessity, and there is nothing wrong with the donor giving his blood either.
3.                The guidelines of Islamic Shari`ah dictate that donating blood should be permitted, because one of its principles is that in cases of necessity, things that are ordinarily forbidden are permitted, and that ways should be found to ease hardship. The sick person is certainly in a hardship situation, and is compelled by necessity. The hardship he is facing could lead to his death, so it is permissible for him to receive a blood transfusion. (For more details on the issue of donating blood, please see Question #2570 ).
Does blood donation break wudu?
As regards the question of whether wudu is broken by the flowing of blood, this is an issue concerning which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, differed. Those who think that bleeding breaks wudu quote as evidence the hadith of Abu’l-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) vomited, then did wudu.” They drew an analogy between vomit and blood, because both are najis (impure) when they come out of the body.
This hadith was narrated by Ahmad (4/449), Abu Dawud (2981) and al-Tirmidhi (87), who said: “More than one of the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others among the Tabi’in thought that wudu should be done after vomiting or having a nosebleed. This is the opinion of Sufyan al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq. Some scholars said that wudu is not necessary after vomiting or having a nosebleed. This is the opinion of Malik and al-Shafi’i.” This was also narrated as being the opinion of Ahmad. Al-Baghawi said: It is the opinion of most of the Sahabah and Tabi’in.”
The most correct view is that bleeding does not break one’s wudu, although it is preferable (mustahabb) to make wudu after bleeding. The evidence for this is as follows:
1.      Wudu is considered to be valid until there is proof that something breaks it. There is no proof narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that bleeding breaks wudu , hence Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “There is no proof whatsoever that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it obligatory to do wudu because of that (bleeding).” Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said, the correct opinion is that bleeding and vomiting , etc., do not break wudu, whether they are large or small in volume, because there is no evidence to prove that they break wudu, and the guiding principle is that wudu remains valid.
2.      One cannot draw an analogy between blood and anything else, because the reasons behind them are not the same.
3.      The idea that bleeding breaks wudu is contrary to what was reported from the salaf (early generations), for example, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) continued to pray although his wound was pouring with blood. Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “The Muslims continue to pray even when they are wounded.”
4.      The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did wudu after he vomited does not indicate that it is obligatory to do so, because the rules of fiqh say that the mere fact that he did something, unless it was accompanied by a command to do it, does not make it obligatory. All that this proves is that it is good to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this instance. Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Doing wudu after cupping and vomiting is mustahabb and is good.”
To sum up the above, it is mustahabb (preferable) for a blood donor to do wudu after giving blood, but if he does not do wudu, it is still OK.
And Allah knows best.

I happened to had masturbated while I was fasting during ramadan. Then I read in one of islamic question/answer column in a newspaper that the act of masturbation invalidate the fasting but no ""kaffara"" is required i.e. freeing a slave or fasting for 60 days. Is this true?
The other question is that at that time I did not know that kaffara is not required so I ate (I though my fasting is invalid so I ate). does this will make me do the kaffara or not. JazakaAllah for the response.",Masturbation breaks the fast and the one who does that has to make up for the day that he broke his fast. He must also repent from this great sin.,"Praise be to Allah.Is masturbation haram?
No doubt masturbation is haram according to most of the scholars, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said. If this happens in Ramadan, this is worse, and if there is ejaculation of sperm because of the masturbation , the violation of the sanctity of the fast is even more severe in sin. 
Does masturbation break your fast?
From the time the maniy (semen) is ejaculated, the fast is broken, but the person should still fast for the rest of that day. It is not permissible for him to stop fasting, because of the sanctity of the month. 
You have to repent for breaking your fast by deliberately ejaculating, and you also have to repent for not keeping the fast for the rest of the day and for violating the sanctity of the fast by doing something else that broke the fast, namely eating food. 
You also have to fast one day to make up for breaking your fast. Increase the number of good deeds (hasanat) you do and observe nafl (supererogatory) fasts, for good deeds (hasanat) cancel out bad deeds (sayyiat). And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
And Allah knows best."

I read the hadiths about the prophet peace be upon him allowing the man to see the woman before deciding whether to marry her or not. My questions is, what exactelly is the person allowed to see exactelly?
Is he allowed to see her hair (entire head) ?",,"Praise be to Allah.Islam commands us to lower our gaze and forbids looking at non-mahram women. This is in order to purify people’s souls and protect their honour. There are, however, certain exceptions in which it is permissible to look at a non-mahram woman for reasons of necessity, one of which is in the case of proposing marriage, because it is the basis on which a very important decision affecting a person’s life will be taken. There are texts which indicate that it is permissible to look at one’s fiancée, as follows:


From Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at her to see that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.’ I proposed marriage to a young woman, and I used to hide where I could see her, until I saw that which encouraged me to go ahead and marry her, so I did so.’” According to another report he said, ‘a young woman of Bani Salamah. I used to hide from her, until I saw that which encouraged me to go ahead and marry her, so I did so.”


(Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 1832, 1834)
From Abu Hurayrah: “I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Have you seen her?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and look at her, for there is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.”
(Reported by Muslim, no. 1424; and by al-Daaraqutni, 3/253 (34))
From al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah: “I proposed marriage to a woman, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Have you seen her?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Look at her, because it is more fitting that love and compatibility be established between you.’” According to another report: “So he did that, and he married her and mentioned that they got along.”
(Reported by al-Daaraqutni, 3/252 (31, 32); Ibn Maajah, 1/574)
From Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him): “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have come to give myself to you (in marriage).” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at her closely, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not made a decision about her, she sat down. One of his Companions stood up and said, O Messenger of Allah, if you do not want her, then marry her to me…’”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7/19; Muslim, 4/143; al-Nisaa’i, 6/113 bi Sharh al-Suyooti; al-Bayhaqi, 7/84)
The sayings of the scholars on the extent to which one may look at one’s fiancée
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he wants to marry a woman, he is not allowed to see her without a headcover. He may look at her face and hands when she is covered, with or without her permission. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent…’ [al-Noor 24:31]. He said: ‘The face and hands.’”
(al-Haawi al-Kabeer, 9/34).
Imaam al-Nawawi said in Rawdat al-Taalibeen wa ‘Umdat al-Mufteen (7, 19-20): “When (a man) wants to marry (a woman), it is preferable (mustahabb) for him to look at her so that he will have no regrets. According to another view, it is not preferable but it is allowed. The first view is correct because of the ahaadeeth, and it is permitted to look repeatedly, with or without her permission. If it is not easy to look at her, he may send a woman to check her out and describe her to him. A woman may also look at a man if she wants to marry him, for she will like in him what he likes in her. What is permissible for him to look at is the face and hands, front and back. He should not look at anything else.”
Abu Haneefah permitted looking at the feet as well as the face and hands.
(Bidaayah al-Mujtahid wa Nihayyat al-Muqtasid, 3/10)
“It is permissible to look at the face, hands and feet, and no more than that.” Ibn Rushd also quoted it as above.
Among the reports from the madhhab of Imaam Maalik:


He may look at the face and hands only.


He may look at the face, hands and forearms only.


A number of reports were narrated from Imaam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), one of which says that he may look at the face and forearms.
The second says that he may look at what usually appears such as the neck, calves and so on.
This was quoted by Ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni (7/454), Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (3/25-26), and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (11/78)… The reliable opinion in the books of the Hanbalis is the second opinion.
From the above, it is clear that the majority of scholars say that a man is allowed to look at his fiancée’s face and hands, because the face indicates beauty or ugliness, and the hands indicate the slimness or plumpness (literally, ‘fertility’) of the body.
Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “There is no dispute among the scholars that he is permitted to look at the face.. the focus of beauty and the place at which one looks.”
Ruling on touching one’s fiancée or being alone with her
Al-Zayla’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible for him to touch her face or hands – even if is sure that this will not provoke desire – because she is still haraam for him, and there is no need for him to do so.” In Durar al-Bihaar it says: “It is not permitted for the qaadi, the witnesses or the fiancé to touch her, even if they are sure that this will not provoke desire, because there is no need for that…”
(Radd al-Muhtaar ‘ala’l-Durr al-Mukhtaar, 5/237)
Ibn Qudaamah said: “It is not permitted for him to be alone with her, because she is forbidden and Islam only allows him to look, thus khulwah (being alone with her) remains forbidden, and because there is no certainty that nothing forbidden will take place if he is alone with her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘No man is alone with a woman, but the Shaytaan is the third one present.’ He should not look at her in a lustful or suspicious manner. Ahmad said, in a report narrated by Saalih, ‘He may look at the face, but not in a lustful manner.’ He may look repeatedly, and examine her beauty, because the aim cannot be achieved in any other way.”
The fiancée’s permission to look
A man is permitted to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose marriage, even without her permission or knowledge. This is what is indicated by the saheeh ahaadeeth.
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (9/157): “The majority of scholars said: he is permitted to look at her if he wishes without her permission.”
The hadith scholar Shaykh Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albani said in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (1/156), supporting this view: “Similar evidence is seen in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hadith, ‘Even if she does not know.’ This is supported by the actions of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), in accordance with the Sunnah, such as Muhammad ibn Muslimah and Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah, both of whom hid so as to see of their fiancées that which would encourage them to go ahead and marry them…”
Note:
Shaykh al-Albani also said (op.cit., p. 156):
“From Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him)” ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to marry a woman, so he sent another woman to look at her and said, “Smell her mouth (front teeth) and look at the back of her ankles.”
(Reported by al-Haakim, 2/166, who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Also reported by al-Bayhaqi, 7/87. In Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (4/507) he said, ‘”Reported by Ahmad and al-Bazzaar, and the men of al-Bazzaar are thiqaat.”)
In Mughni al-Muhtaaj (2/128) it says: “What we understand from this report is that the one who is sent may describe to the one who sends her more than that which he himself may see, so this sending achieves more than just looking.”
And Allah knows best."
805,2577,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2577,How to Use Miswak,"Question

What are the regulations regarding the miswak (tooth stick) and its usage:
1. its length and type;
2. how to hold and brush with it according to the Sunnah;
3. when to use it: before beginning wudu, before one rinses one's mouth, or just before beginning the prayer;
4. its recommended, permissible, disliked and forbidden times and circumstances for usage;
5. whether lemon, mint flavored ones are permissible;
6. its virtues?",Siwak is a method of cleaning the mouth which also earns the pleasure of Allah. Siwak is sunnah and recommended at all times of night and day. The scholars have differed as to whether siwak should be done with the right hand or the left hand.,"Praise be to Allah.What is siwak?
Siwak means cleaning the mouth and teeth with a siwak which is the name given to the tool used. The siwak is a stick or twig used for this purpose.
Siwak is a method of cleaning the mouth which also earns the pleasure of Allah, as is proven in the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Siwak cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord. (Reported by al-Bukhari in his Sahih, 2/274, and by  Ahmad, 6/47, and al-Nasai, 1/50. Its isnad is sahih, see al-Irwa 1/105)
Is it sunnah to use the siwak?
Use of the siwak is repeatedly encouraged, as in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/299 and Muslim, 1/151). According to another report narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: at every time of making wudu.
Imam al-Nawawi reported that the respectable scholars were agreed that use of the siwak is sunnah and is encouraged. One of the signs of its importance is the fact that some of the salaf (early generations of Islam), such as Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, thought that it was obligatory.
Times when use of siwak is recommended
Siwak is recommended at all times of night and day, because of the general sense of the hadith quoted above from ‘Aishah, Siwak cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord. The scholars have also mentioned situations where use of the siwak is even more strongly encouraged. These include:

When making wudu and at times of prayer.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. According to another report he said: at every time of making wudu as already stated above.

When entering one's home to be with one’s family.

‘Aishah was asked what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did when he first came home. She said, When he entered his house, the first thing he would do was to use the siwak. (Reported by Muslim, 1/220)

When getting up from sleep. Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up during the night, he would clean his mouth thoroughly with the siwak. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1/98 and Muslim, 1/220)


When the smell of one’s mouth changes whether this is because of eating food with a strong odour, or because of not eating or drinking for a long time, etc. Siwak is cleansing for the mouth, which means that it should definitely be used when the mouth needs cleaning.
When going to the mosque . Using siwak is part of the adornment which we are commanded to wear for every prayer, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O Children of Adam! Take your adornment while praying [al-A'raf 7:31]. It is also important because the angels are present in the mosque, and one is going to meet with other worshippers there.

When reading Quran and joining gatherings in which Allah is remembered (dhikr), because the angels are present on such occasions.

Using siwak when fasting

The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are agreed that there is nothing wrong with using siwak during the day when one is fasting , but they differed with regard to using it after noon, which some of them disliked (regarded as makruh). The correct view is that it is sunnah for one who is fasting, just as it is for anyone else, because of the general sense of the reports which prove that it is sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any exceptions or state any specific time, and a statement that is general in nature should continue to be taken as general unless there is evidence to indicate that it is specific in application. The hadith used as evidence to forbid using siwak after noon is attributed to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), who is quoted as saying that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When you fast, use siwak in the morning but do not use it in the afternoon. (Reported by al-Daraqutni)
This is a weak hadith. Ibn Hajar said, in al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/62: a weak isnad). There is no proof that this can be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to the use of the hadith, the odour that comes from the mouth of the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk (reported by al-Bukhari, 2/29 and Muslim, 2/806) as evidence, this mouth odour will not be dispelled by use of siwak because it is caused by the stomach being empty, and it could occur early in the day if a person has not eaten suhur. All the scholars are agreed that it is permissible for a fasting person to use siwak early in the day. This shows that use of siwak is encouraged even when fasting, and there is no difference between using it early in the day or later on.
What should be used for siwak (cleaning the mouth)
The scholars are agreed that the best thing for cleaning the mouth is the twigs of the arak tree, because of its good smell, and because it has brush-like fibers which are effective for cleaning food particles etc. from between the teeth, and because of the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I used to gather siwak sticks from the arak tree for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Reported by Ahmad, 3991; its isnad is hasan, see al-Irwa 1/104)
If arak twigs are not available, the scholars recommended using palm-leaf stalks, or twigs of the olive tree. The hadiths that have been narrated concerning this, however, are not sahih.
The correct view is that any kind of sticks that are cleansing and not harmful may be used instead of siwak, if it is not available, to clean the mouth and remove dirt from the teeth. This includes modern toothbrushes which are known to be beneficial in this regard.
Things that may not be used for siwak
The scholars have stated that it is forbidden to use poisonous sticks, things that are not pure and anything that may cause bleeding, illness or any other harm.
Attributes of siwak
The jurists have described the siwak as a stick of medium length and thickness, no thicker than ones little finger, and free of knots. It should not be so wet that it will twist, because then it will not remove dirt, nor should it be so dry that it will hurt the mouth or crack during use. No doubt this is describing the ideal, otherwise the reports do not specify any particular type of siwak. It is permissible to use any kind of siwak that will do the job.
How to use the siwak
The scholars have differed as to whether siwak should be done with the right hand or the left hand. One group, the majority, think that it is better to use the right hand, because of the general meaning of the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to start with the right when putting on his shoes, dismounting (from his camel), when cleaning himself, and in all things. (Agreed upon). (They also say that) siwak is an act of worship and drawing closer to Allah, so it should not be done with the left hand.
Other scholars say that it is better to use the left hand for siwak, because it comes under the heading of removing dirt. This is the well-known opinion of Imam Ahmad’s madhhab, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him.
Some scholars have said that when a person is using siwak with the intention of following the sunnah, he should use his right hand, and if he is doing it to remove dirt, he should use his left hand. The fact of the matter is that this issue is open, as there is no definitive evidence or report, and every opinion has a valid point.
The jurists suggested that when using siwak, a person should start on the right, and use a side-to-side motion rather than up-and-down, as the latter may harm the gums. 
Etiquette of using siwak
Among the etiquette of using siwak, they mentioned the following:

That a person should not use the siwak in front of others or in public, because this is impolite.
That the siwak should be washed after use, to get rid of any dirt that may be on it. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use siwak, then he would give it to me to wash it. I would use it first, then wash it and give it back to him. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/45).
The siwak should be kept in a clean place.

Using one's fingers to clean one's mouth
The scholars differ as to whether it is acceptable to use one's fingers to clean one's mouth when there is nothing else available. The correct view is that using the fingers cannot be considered as a substitute for the sunnah action, because there is no basis in Islam for doing so, and this method does not clean the mouth as a siwak or similar instrument does. Modern methods of cleaning the teeth, like toothbrushes and so on, that remove dirt and make the mouth smell good, are acceptable.
There is nothing wrong with using siwak that is flavoured with mint, lemon and so on, so long as they do not cause any harm. But a person who is fasting should avoid using any flavoured siwak, and should only use natural siwak when he is fasting.
And Allah knows best.

I felt a deep sense of regret when she had her operation, but was hesitant to say anything because I did not want to worry her.  Later, after the operation, she changed.  She had many complications, and lost interest in me sexually. I still want more children, and I am getting older.  We have two -- one together, who is xxx, and a stepson, who is xxx.  The younger one has received Islamic instruction and accepts Islam as his religion, but the older one rejects it completely.  I love them all, but the situation saddens me.  I would like to start a new family, not discarding old one.  She prohibits me from another wife (but not in the contract), and I know she will leave me if I do.  My question is, what advice do you have to give me?  I love my wife, but I want to have more children, and my desire to be a father once again, raising my children in Islam is strong.  She also rejects adoption, even if it were halal. I am just looking for a way out of my dilemma.  Do you think my desire to start another family is halal? What does Islam suggest in this case?",,"Praise be to Allah.Your desire to form

I am in the process of becoming a truly practicing Muslim and wonder what is said regarding your life previous to the full integration of Islam. I wonder whether any experiences that I have had would limit me from becoming a follower of the straigt path to Allah?
Please forgive my explicitness...but since men and women are not allowed to engage in full-blown relationships, how do I resolve the conflict that prior to it's integration in my life, I have had different experiences and now have read repeatedly that it is forbidden...how can I possibly reconcile the two dichotomous notions? I recognize that you do receive many questions, please accept my sincere thanks for having this site, regardless of whether I receive an answer or not.
May peace be with you...:)",,"Praise be to Allah.We cannot conceal our joy and pleasure at the intention expressed in your question of embracing the true religion, Islam. The confusion and hesitation that you describe are quite understandable, because when a person has been indulging in forbidden relationships and then wishes to move to a religion of purity and chastity, it is natural to feel that his own nafs (desires) will defeat him and that he will not be able to do what Islam requires of him in the way of purity and chastity. But we will tell you some things here which we hope will help you to overcome any difficulty that you may be fearing and give a true picture of the situation.
When a person follows the true religion, it is expected to have a far-reaching effect on his personality and behaviour, so that it re-forms him and gives him a fresh start and a new direction in life, completely different from the way he was during his jaahiliyyah (days of ignorance before his Islam). This radical change will produce morals and values that were not there before, which will purify his heart and fill him with a sense of chastity, so that the new Muslim looks with revulsion and disgust both at his own former deeds and at the ignorant world of promiscuity, infidelity, nakedness and utter corruption that exists in the society around him. He will come back to the sound nature (fitrah the natural state of man) and purity of heart of which Shaytaan had robbed him during the days when he was a non-Muslim and sinner. This new direction in life is undertaken freely, by choice, and is accompanied by contentment and acceptance stemming from his total submission to the commands and prohibitions of Allah, Who revealed this religion of Islam with all its laws. We have two sources of proof to support what we say here, one from the shareeah (Islamic law)and one from history.
The shari(textual) evidence is to be found in numerous places in the Quran, for example (interpretation of the meanings):
Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and by disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and by faith) and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out? [al-Anaam 6:122]
And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace,
Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
Concerning the phrase Allah will change their sins into good deeds the mufassireen (commentators) said: their evil deeds will be replaced by good deeds. Ali ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbaas said: These are the believers, who before they believed did evil deeds, but Allah wanted them to do something else, so He changed their bad deeds into good deeds
Ataa ibn Abi Rabaah said: This is in this world: a man may be doing evil but then Allah replaces it with good. Saeed ibn Jubayr said: Allah changed them from worshippers of idols into worshippers of the Most Merciful, and changed them from those who fight the Muslims into those who fight the (polytheists), and from those who marry mushrik (polytheist)women into those who marry believing women. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: Allah changed them from evil deeds to good deeds, from shirk (polytheism) to ikhlaas (purity of faith), from promiscuity to chastity, from disbelief to Islam. This is the view of Abu Aaliyah, Qutaadah and a group of others.
(Ibn Katheer, Tafseer al-Quran al-Azeem).
The historical evidence includes a number of stories of Muslims who entered Islam after having been (disbelievers), and how they changed and became righteous. Among these stories is the following:
There was a (Muslim) man called Marthad ibn Abi Marthad who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah (which was the territory of the mushrikeen) to Madeenah (which was the territory of the Muslims). There was also a woman in Makkah, called Anaaq, who was a prostitute. She had been a friend of Marthads (before he became Muslim). Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madeenah. He said: I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then Anaaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: Marthad? I said, Marthad. She said: Welcome! Stay with us tonight. I said, O Anaaq, Allah has forbidden zinaa (unlawful sexual relations). She called out, O people of the camp! This man is stealing away your prisoners! (i.e., she wanted to take revenge on him because he refused to have unlawful relations with her, so she called the polytheists to come and seize him). Eight men pursued me (and he described how Allah saved him from them). This event was the reason for the revelation of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman; to the Believers such a thing is forbidden. [al-Noor 24:3 Yusuf Alis translation]
(Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 3101).
The reason for telling this story is that it illustrates how this man changed after he embraced Islam, and refused to commit the haraam deed with which he was tempted. Another story describes a woman who embraced Islam and became righteous:
Abd-Allah ibn Maghfal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with polytheism and had brought Islam. So he left her alone and went away.
(Reported by al-Haakim, who said this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, although they did not report it).
If you enter Islam and become a truly practicsing Muslim, adhering to this pure shareeah, worshipping Allah(God willing) as He wants to be worshipped, obeying His commands and heeding His prohibitions, then in sha Allah you will not encounter or suffer the difficulties you refer to in your question. Moreover, you will have the means of keeping chaste, such as marriage, which will help you to refrain from doing unlawful deeds; marriage is enjoined by this shareeah. The one who chooses a pure and clean way has no need to enter the mire (of illicit relationships). We ask Allah to guide you and make things easy for you, and to keep evil away from you. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

809,2587,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2587,Types of Vows in Islam,"Question

What are the different types of vows in Islam?","There are several types of vows: 1- vows which must be fulfilled, 2- vows which it is forbidden to fulfill, 3- vows which require kafarat yamin, and 4- vows which you can either fulfill or expiate by kafarat yamin.","Praise be to Allah.What is a vow?
Al-Isfahani (may Allah have mercy on him) says, in his book Mufradat Alfaz al-Quran (Vocabulary of the Quran), p. 797:
“Al-Nadhr (vow): when you oblige yourself to do something that is not obligatory because of something that you want to happen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘[Maryam said:] I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (Allah)…’ [Maryam 19:26].”
So a vow is the action, on the part of a person who is adult and of sound mind (mukallaf), of obliging himself to do something that is not obligatory , whether he intends to do it straight away or makes his doing it conditional upon something else.
Vows are mentioned in the Quran in approving terms. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the abrar (pious, who fear Allah and avoid evil), shall drink a cup (of wine) mixed with water from a spring in Paradise called Kafur, a spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. They (are those who) fulfill their vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be wide spreading.” [al-Dahr 76:5-7]. So Allah makes their fear of the horrors of the Day of Resurrection and their fulfillment of their vows some of the reasons for their salvation and admittance to Paradise.
Do you have to fulfill your vows?
Fulfilling legitimate (Shar`i) vows is obligatory according to Shari`ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then let them complete the prescribed duties (manasik of Hajj) for them, and perform their vows…” [al-Hajj 22:29]. Imam al-Shawkani said: “This means that they have to do this.”
Numerous hadiths have been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) discouraging vows and describing them as makruh. Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not make vows, for vows do not change qadar (the divine decree) in the slightest, but they make the stingy person give something up.’” (Reported by Muslim)
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to discourage us from making vows, and said, ‘They do not change anything, although they may make the miser give up something.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim)
One might ask, how is it that those who fulfill their vows are praised, then making vows is discouraged? The answer is that the kind of vow that is praised is the vow to do acts of worship that are not connected to anything – i.e., not conditional upon anything – which makes a man force himself to do acts of worship and prevent himself from being lazy, or in thanksgiving for some blessing. 
What are the discouraged types of vows?
The kinds of vow which are discouraged are of different types, including vows that are made in return for something, whereby a person makes his doing an act of worship conditional upon attaining something or warding off something, and if that does not happen, he does not do the act of worship. 
Why are these types of vows discouraged?
This is what is discouraged, perhaps for the following reasons:

Because then the person who made the vow would be doing the act of worship reluctantly, because it has become something he cannot avoid or get out of.
Because when the person making the vow makes the act of worship conditional upon his getting what he wants, his vow becomes a kind of exchange or barter which corrupts his intention; if the sick person is not cured, he will not give the charity which he vowed to give if the sick person was healed. This is miserliness, because the miser will not give anything except for something in return in this life (as opposed to the Hereafter), and what he gains is more than what he gives.
Some people ignorantly believe that making a vow guarantees that they will get whatever they made the vow for, or that Allah will make it happen for them because of the vow.
Another ignorant belief is the idea that making a vow can change qada (the divine decree), or that it can bring them some immediate benefit or ward off some harm. So vows were discouraged lest ignorant people believe such things, and as a warning of the danger that such attitudes present to sound belief.

Types of vows and their fulfillment

Vows which must be fulfilled (vows to do acts of worship and obedience to Allah)

This includes every vow which involves a promise to do some kind of act of worship, such as praying, fasting, performing ‘Umrah or Hajj, upholding family ties, doing I’tikaf (retreat for worship in the mosque), jihad, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. For example, a person may say, “It is my duty towards Allah to fast such-and-such (days)” or to give such-and-such in charity, or to go for Hajj this year, or to pray two rak`ahs in al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] in thanksgiving to Allah for curing a sick person. Or he may make a vow of doing some act of worship conditional upon something that will benefit him if it happens, so he says, “If my absent loved one returns or Allah protects me from the evil of my enemy, I will fast such-and-such (days) or give such-and-such in charity.”
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6202)
If a man vows to do some act of worship then circumstances change and prevent him from fulfilling his vow, such as he vows to fast for a month or to go for Hajj or ‘Umrah, then he falls sick and is unable to fast or travel, or he vows to give charity, then he becomes poor and is unable to give what he promised, then in such cases he must offer expiation (kaffarah) for breaking his vow, which is the same as kaffarat yamin (expiation for breaking an oath). Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “Whoever makes a vow and is then unable to fulfill it, his expiation is kaffarat yamin.” (Reported by Abu Dawud. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Bulugh al-Maram, Its isnad is sahih, and some huffaz thought it was mawquf.).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa (33/49): “If a man intends to vow to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then he must fulfill it. If he does not fulfill his vow to Allah, then he must offer kaffarat yamin, according to the majority of the salaf (early generations of Islam).”

Vows which it is forbidden to fulfill, and for which kaffarat yami n must be offered

This includes different types of vows:

Vows to commit sin :

This is every vow which involves disobedience to Allah, such as vows to bring oil, candles or money to graves or shrines (mash-hads), or to visit tombs and shrines of shirk. This is in some ways like making vows to idols. It is also forbidden to fulfill vows which promise to do some sin, like committing zina (adultery, fornication), drinking alcohol, stealing, taking orphans’ property, denying someone’s rights, or cutting family ties by cutting a certain relative off or not entering his house for no shar’i reason. All of these are not permitted at all, and (the person who makes such a vow) must offer kaffarat yamin in expiation for his vow. The evidence (dalil) that it is not permissible to fulfill this kind of vow is the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari). ‘Imran ibn Husayn reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no fulfillment of a vow to commit sin.” (Reported by Muslim, 3099).

Vows that go against a shar’i text (of the Quran or Sunnah)

If a Muslim makes a vow then it becomes clear to him that this vow of his goes against a clear, sahih text that contains some command or prohibition, then he must refrain from fulfilling his vow, and offer kaffarat yamin for it. The evidence for this is the report of al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) from Ziyad ibn Jubayr, who said: “I was with Ibn ‘Umar and a man asked him, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday as long as I live, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice, i.e., the first day of ‘Eid al-Adha).’ He said, ‘Allah has commanded us to fulfill vows and we are forbidden to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ He repeated this to him, and said no more and no less.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, 6212).
Imam Ahmad reported that Ziyad ibn Jubayr said: “A man asked Ibn ‘Umar, whilst he was walking in Mina, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr, so what do you think?’ He said, ‘Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfill our vows, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ The man thought that he had not heard him properly, so he said, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr.’ [Ibn ‘Umar] said, ‘Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfill our vows, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ They kept repeating this exchange until they reached the mountain.”
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The scholars agree that it is not permitted to fast on Yawm al-Fitr and Yawm al-Nahr, neither as an act of worship nor in fulfillment of a vow.”

Vows concerning which there is no ruling other than kaffarat yamin

There are some vows concerning which there is no ruling other than that the one who makes such a vow must offer kaffarat yamin in expiation for his vow. These include:

Non-specific vows

If a Muslim makes a vow but does not specify what the vow is about, such as saying, “I make a vow if Allah heals this sick person” – but does not specify anything, then he must offer kaffarat yamin. ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The expiation for a vow is kaffarat yamin.” (Reported by Muslim). Imam al-Nawawi said: “Malik and many others – indeed the majority – interpreted this as meaning absolute vows, such as saying ‘I vow’ [without being specific].” (Sharh Muslim li’l-Nawawi, 11/104).

Vows concerning things that one does not possess.

If a person makes a vow concerning something that is not his, then he has no option but to offer kaffarat yamin. For example, if he vows to give charity from someone else’s wealth, or to free someone else’s slave, or to give a garden that he does not own to someone. The evidence for this ruling is the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The son of Adam cannot make any vow concerning that which is not his, he cannot free (any slave) who is not his, and he cannot divorce any wife who is not his.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1101. He said: The hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr is a sahih hasan hadith).

Vows where one has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kaffarat yamin

There are vows where a person has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kaffarat yamin. This kind of vow includes:

Vows made in desperation or in anger:

This means every vow that comes in the form of an oath made to urge for something to be done or to stop something from being done, or to swear that something is true or not true, where the person does not really intend to make a vow to do some act of worship. For example, a man might say in anger, ‘If I ever do such-and-such I have to go for Hajj, or fast for a month, or give one thousand dinars in charity’ or, ‘If I ever speak to So-and-So I have to free a slave, or divorce my wife,’ and so on, then he does the thing he said he would not do, but all he really meant by his words was that he would not do that thing – he had no intention of either doing it or the thing he vowed to do if he did.
In such a case, this person – who made the vow for argument’s sake or to express the urgency of doing or refraining from something – has the choice of either fulfilling the vow, or expiating for it by offering kaffarat yamin, because his vow was essentially an oath (yamin).
Ibn Taymiyah said: “If a vow is made in the form of an oath, such as saying, ‘If I travel with you then I have to go for Hajj, or give all my wealth in charity, or free a slave,’ in the opinion of the Sahabah and the majority of the scholars this is hilf al-nadhr (an oath by vowing), it is not a vow. If he does not do what he promised to do, it is sufficient for him to offer kaffarat yamin.” Elsewhere, he said, “The obligation of vows made in anger or desperation is one of two things, according to the majority: either expiation, or doing the thing promised. If he does not fulfill the vow, he must offer expiation (kaffarah).”

Vows concerning permissible things.

This means every vow that includes permissible things, such as vowing to wear a certain type of clothes, eat special foods, ride a certain animal, enter a certain house, and so on.
Thabit ibn al-Dahhak said: “A man vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah (according to one report: because a male child had been born to him). He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ‘I have vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Was there one of the idols of the Jahiliyyah there that people used to worship?’ They said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Did they used to celebrate any of their festivals there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Then fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of vows that involve disobedience to Allah, or that concern things that the son of Adam does not possess.’” (Reported by Abu Dawud, 2881)
This man had vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah (a place beyond Yanbu') in thanksgiving to Allah, may He be exalted, because He had blessed him with a male child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed him to fulfill his vow, so he sacrificed a camel in that place.
We ask Allah to help us to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

This is in regards to Question 'Reading Surat Ya-Sin in congregation on Friday nights '. Actually I am referring to the hadith you mentioned where the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever reads one letter of the Book of Allah will have one hasanah (reward) for doing so, and every hasanah will be multiplied by 10. I do not say that Alif, lam, mim is one letter, but Alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.
I was wondering if this hadith was also true if one is reading the Quran in a different language (i.e. English translation) in order to actually understand what he is reading
Thank You, Allahu-Akbar","There is no evidence that the person who reads the Quran translation will earn the reward of reading it in Arabic. But, if a person reads a Quran translation in order to understand the meaning and benefit from what the verses are saying, then he will be rewarded for doing this, and his reward is with Allah.","Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to reward you for your keenness. In response to your question, the reward mentioned in this hadith is only for the one who reads the Quran as it is in Arabic, not for the one who reads the interpretation of the meanings in any other language. 
However, if a person reads a Quran translation in order to understand the meanings and benefit from what the ayat are saying, then he will be rewarded for doing this, and his reward is with Allah. This is because the Muslim will be rewarded for reading tafsir (explanation and commentary), and a translation is tafsir.
But there is no indication that the person who reads the Quran translation will earn the reward mentioned in the hadith. The bounty of Allah is immense. 
And Allah knows best."
811,2593,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2593,Why So Many Earthquakes?,"Question

Many countries have had earthquakes, such as Turkey, Mexico, Taiwan, Japan, etc. Does this mean anything (from an Islamic point of view)?",The earthquakes that are happening these days are among the signs which Allah uses to frighten His slaves. All the earthquakes and other things which happen and cause harm and injury to people are because of shirk and sins.,"Praise be to Allah.Allah is the All-Wise in all that He legislates and commands
Allah is the All-Wise, All-Knowing in all that He wills and decrees, and He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing in all that He legislates and commands. He creates and decrees whatever signs He wills, to frighten His slaves and remind them of their obligations and duties towards Him, and to warn them against associating anything in worship with Him, going against His commands and doing that which He has forbidden. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And We sent not the signs except to warn” [al-Isra 17:59]
“We will show them Our Signs in the universe, and in their own selves, until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Quran) is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things?” [Fussilat 41:53]
“Say: ‘He has power to send torment on you from above or from under your feet, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.’” [al-An’am 6:65]

Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “Say: ‘He has power to send torment on you from above” was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A’udhu bi wajhika (I seek refuge in Your Face”; “or from under your feet”, he said, “A’udhu bi wajhika (I seek refuge in Your Face).” (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5/193)
(Abu’l-Shaykh al-Isbahani narrated from Mujahid concerning the Tafsir of this ayah, “Say: ‘He has power to send torment on you from above”: (this means) al-Sayhah (the shout or tumult), stones and strong wind; “or from under your feet”, (means) earthquakes and being swallowed up by the earth.)
Earthquakes are signs from Allah
Undoubtedly the earthquakes that are happening these days are among the signs which Allah uses to frighten His slaves. All the earthquakes and other things which happen and cause harm and injury to people are because of shirk and sins, as Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):

“And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much” [al-Shura 42:30]
“Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself” [al-Nisa 4:79]

And Allah said concerning the nations of the past:

“So We punished each (of them) for his sins, of them were some on whom We sent Hasib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lut (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As-Saihah [torment awful cry, (as Thamud or Shu‘ayb’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qarun (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nuh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves” [al-‘Ankabut 29:40]

What to do at times of earthquakes
What Muslims and others who are accountable and of sound mind must do is repent to Allah, adhere firmly to His Religion and avoid all that He has forbidden of Shirk and sin, so that they may be safe and attain salvation from all evils in this world and the next, and so that Allah will ward off from them all harm, and bless them with all good. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwa (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).” [al-A’raf 7:96]

And Allah says concerning the People of the Book (interpretation of the meaning):

“And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Quran), they would surely, have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet” [al-Maidah 5:66].

And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allah? None feels secure from the Plan of Allah except the people who are the losers.” [al-A’raf 7:97-99]

Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah sometimes gives the earth permission to breathe, which is when major earthquakes happen; this makes people feel scared, so they repent, give up sins, pray to Allah and feel regret [for their sins]. When there had been an earthquake, some of the Salaf said: your Lord is warning you. When Madinah was struck by an earthquake, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with you) addressed the people and said: if there is another earthquake, I will not stay here with you.”
And there are many similar reports from the Salaf.
Our response when there is an earthquake or some other sign such as an eclipse, strong winds or floods, should be to hasten to repent to Allah and pray to Him for safety, and to remember Him much and seek His forgiveness, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said when there was an eclipse: “If you see anything like that, hasten to remember Him, call on Him and seek His forgiveness.” (Part of an agreed-upon hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (2/30) and Muslim (2/628))
It is also mustahabb (recommended, encouraged) to show compassion to the poor and needy, and to give charity to them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Show mercy, you will be shown mercy.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 2/165)
“Those who are merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Have mercy on those who are on earth, and the One Who is in heaven will show mercy to you.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (13/285), al-Tirmidhi (6/43)).
“Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5/75), Muslim (4/1809))
It was reported that when there was an earthquake , `Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him) would write to his governors telling them to give in charity.
One of the things which will help to keep people safe and sound is if the authorities impose an immediate crack-down on the foolish elements in society, forcing them to behave and applying the laws of Shari`ah to them, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The believers, men and women, are Awliya (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give the Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:71]
“Verily, Allah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.  Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat-as-Salah [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salah (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakah and they enjoin Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Quran as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures).” [al-Hajj 22:40-41]
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.” [al-Talaq 65:2-3]
And there are many verses on this topic.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever meets the needs of his brother, Allah will meet his needs.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhaari, 3/98; Muslim, 4/1996)
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever relieves a believer of some of the distress of this world, Allah will relieve him of some of the distress of the Day of Resurrection. Whoever makes things easier for one who is suffering hardship, Allah will make things easier for him in this world and in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals a Muslim’s faults, Allah will conceal his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will help a person so long as he helps his brother.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4/2074) And there are many hadiths on this topic.
Allah is the One Whom we ask to reform the affairs of all the Muslims and to bless them with proper understanding of Islam and help them to adhere steadfastly to it and repent to Allah from all their sins. We ask Him to reform all those who are in authority over the Muslims’ affairs and to support the Truth and eradicate falsehood through them, and to help them to rule the people according to the laws of Shari`ah, and to protect them and all the Muslims from misguidance and temptation and the tricks of the Shaytan, for He is Able to do all that.
And Allah knows best."

We know some of them and do not know others, as is indicated by the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘There is no one among you who, when he is stricken with distress and grief, says, “Allahumma inni ‘abduka wabnu ‘abdika wabnu amatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kull ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jilaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi [O Allah, I am Your slave, sone of Your slave and son of Your maidservant, my forelock is in Your hand. Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or You taught to any of Your creation, or revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You nmake the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety]” – but Allah will remove his distress and his grief, and will give him joy instead…”
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 3582; it is a saheeh hadeeth).
Secondly, The names of Allah are all husnaa [Most Beautiful], as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.” [al-A’raaf 7:180]
The meaning of al-husnaa implies the utmost beauty, and that each name includes the quality of perfection.
Al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Many of the names of Allah have been mentioned in the Qur’aan, according to the context, but we also need to point out their broader meanings, so we say:
The name Rabb (Lord, Cherisher) is repeated in many aayaat. The Rabb is the One Who guides and cares for all of His slaves by managing their affairs and bestowing different kinds of blessings. In a more specific sense, He cares for and guides His friends (devoted slaves) by reforming and setting straight their hearts and souls and attitudes. For this reason, many of their du’aa’s or prayers to Him address Him by this glorious Name, because they are asking Him for this specific kind of care.
The name Allah refers to the One Who is adored and worshipped, the One Who possesses the attributes of divinity and to whom all His creation is enslaved. The attributes of divinity with which He describes Himself are the attributes of perfection.
Al-Malik (the Sovereign), al-Maalik (the Possessor), Alladhi lahu’l-Mulk (the One to Whom Dominion belongs). Allah is the One Who is described with the attributes of sovereignty and dominion, which are the qualities of might and pride, subjugation and control. He is the One Who is in absolute control of creation, Who issues commands and Who rewards or punishes. The entire Universe, high and low, belongs to Him. All of them are His servants and slaves, and are utterly dependent on Him.
Al-Waahid (the One), al-Ahad (the Unique). He is the One Who is uniquely and utterly and perfectly One, with no partners in His Uniqueness. His slaves are obliged to believe in His Oneness, in belief and word and deed, by recognizing that He is absolutely perfect and is unique in His oneness, and by directing all kinds of worship to Him Alone.
Al-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He is the One to Whom all of creation turns for all of their needs, for He is in and of Himself absolutely perfect, in His Names and Attributes and Deeds.
Al-‘Aleem (the All-Knowing), al-Khabeer (the Aware). He is the One Whose Knowledge encompasses all things, seen and unseen, secret and open, everything that is inevitable or impossible or possible, in heaven and on earth, the past, the present and the future. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.
Al-Hakeem (the Wise). He is the One Who has ultimate wisdom, in His creation and in His commands. He is the One Who created everything well.
“… And who is better in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith.” [al-Maa’idah 5:50 – interpretation of the meaning].
He does not create anything in vain, or legislate anything in jest. He is the One Who has Dominion in this world and the next. His ruling applies in three major spheres, in which none else has any share with Him: He judges between His slaves by means of His Law, His decree and His reward/punishment.
Wisdom: He puts things in their rightful places and gives them their rightful status.
Al-Rahman (the Most Gracious), al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), al-Barr (the Source of Goodness), al-Kareem (the Most Generous), al-Jawaad (the Generous), al-Ra’oof (the Compassionate), al-Wahhaab (the Bestower). These names are all close in meaning, and they all indicate that the Rabb is characterized by mercy, goodness, and generosity. They testify to the vastness of His mercy and other attributes, with which He encompasses all of His creation to the extent that His wisdom decrees, although the greater share is bestowed upon the believers in particular. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… My Mercy encompasses all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are the Muttaqoon (pious)…”
[al-A’raaf 7:156]
Blessings and goodness are all traces of His Mercy and Generosity. The good things of this world and the next are all traces of His Mercy.
Al-Samee’ (the All-Hearing). He hears all voices, in all the different languages, no matter how many and how varied, when they call on Him for their needs.
Al-Baseer (the All-Seeing) Who has insight into all things, not matter how small. He can see a black ant walking across the face of a rock on the darkest night. He can see what is below the seven levels of the earth and what is above the seven heavens. He is the All-Hearing and All-Seeing, Who knows who is deserving of reward or punishment according to His Wisdom.
Al-Hameed (the Praiseworthy), Who is inherently deserving of praise, by His Names, Attributes and deeds. He has the Most Beautiful Names, the most perfect attributes and the most perfect and beautiful deeds. His actions always revolve around munificence and justice.
Al-Majeed (the Most Glorious), al-Kabeer (the Most Great), al-‘Azeem (the Most Great), al-Jaleel (the Sublime One). These Names describe Allah with attributes of glory, pride, greatness and majesty. He is greater than everything, more mighty, more majestic and more exalted. To Him belong glorification and exaltation in the hearts of His close friends and devoted slaves, whose hearts are filled with veneration of His might and humble submission to His glory.
Al-‘Afuw (the Pardoner), al-‘Ghafoor (the Forgiver), al-Ghaffaar (the All-Forgiving), Who has always been and will always be known for His pardon and forgiveness towards His slaves. Everyone is in need of His pardon and forgiveness, as they are in need of His mercy and generosity. He has promised to forgive and pardon whoever follows the appropriate means. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, I am indeed Forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death).”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
Al-Tawwaab (the Acceptor of Repentance). He always accepts the repentance of those who repent and forgives the sins of those who commit sin. Allah accepts the repentance of everyone who repents to Him sincerely. He is the One Who forgives those who repent, firstly by helping them to repent and causing their hearts to turn towards Him. After they repent, He turns to them and accepts their repentance, pardoning their sins.
Al-Quddoos (the Holy) and al-Salaam (the One Free from all defects). Allah is far above any attribute of imperfection, and He is above being likened to any of His creation.
“… There is nothing like unto Him…”
[al-Shoora 42:11]
“And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.”
[al-Ikhlaas 112:4]
“… Do you know of any who is similar to Him?…”
[Maryam 19:65]
“… Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship)…”
[al-Baqarah 2:22]
The names al-Quddoos and al-Salaam reject the idea that He could be lacking in any way, and they imply that He is absolutely perfect in all aspects, because once the idea of imperfection is rejected, this is proof of total perfection.
Al-‘Aliyy (the Exalted), al-A’laa (the Most High). He is the One Who is completely exalted in all aspects, in His essence, in His status, in His attributes and in His dominion. He is the One Who rose over the Throne and Who dominates all things. In all the attributes of might, pride, glory and beauty that are ascribed to Him, He reaches the ultimate level.
Al-‘Azeez (the Almighty), to whom belong all might and power, the power of strength, the power of dominion, the power of invincibility. None of His creatures can harm Him. He has subjugated all that exists, and the whole of creation is under His control and is subject to His might.
Al-Qawiy (the Most Strong), al-Mateen (the Firm One). The meanings of these Names are similar to the meaning of al-‘Azeez.
Al-Jabbaar (the Compeller). This Names includes the meanings of al-‘Aliyy, al-A’laa and al-Qahhaar.
Al-Ra’oof (the Compassionate) means the One Who consoles broken hearts and supports the weak and those who seek His help and turn to Him.
Al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic) is the One Who is above all bad qualities, shortcomings and faults, because of His might and pride.
Al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari’ (the Inventor of all things), al-Musawwir (the Bestower of forms). He is the One Who has created from nothing all that exists, and formed it by His wisdom, praise be to Him. He has always been and will always be known by this mighty attribute.
Al-Mu’min (the Guardian of Faith), Who is praised for His own sake by His perfect attributes, and by the perfection of His majesty and beauty. He sent His Messengers and revealed His Books with signs and proofs, and confirmed His Messengers with signs and proofs, to confirm the truth of the message they brought.
Al-Muhaymin (the Watcher over His creatures) Who is aware of everything that is hidden and concealed, and Whose knowledge encompasses all things.
Al-Qadeer (the Powerful), Whose power is perfect. By His power He created all things that exist, by His power He is controlling all things and by His power He formed them and perfected them. By His power He gives life and death, and will resurrect His slaves to receive their reward or punishment, so that those who have done well will be rewarded with good, and those who have done evil will be punished. When Allah wills a thing, He merely says “Be!” and it is. By His power He controls people’s hearts, and He directs them as He wills.
Al-Lateef (the Most Subtle and Courteous), Whose knowledge encompasses everything that is hidden and concealed. He knows everything that is secret and understands the most subtle things. He is Kind to His believing slaves and takes care of their interests by His benevolence and grace, in many ways that they are not even aware of. This Name also shares the meanings of al-Khabeer and al-Ra’oof.
Al-Haseeb (the One Who takes account). He is the One Who is All-Knowing about His slaves. He is Sufficient for those who put their trust in Him, and He rewards or punishes His slaves for good and evil, according to His wisdom. He knows about all their deeds, major and minor.

Al-Hafeez (the Preserver). He is the One Who protects what He has created and encompasses it with His knowledge. He protects His close friends from falling into sin and destruction, and gently protects them when they are active and when they are at rest. He counts the deeds of His slaves and rewards or punishes them accordingly.
Al-Muheet (the Encompasser). He is the One Who encompasses all things with His knowledge, power, mercy and dominion.
Al-Qahhaar (the Subduer). He is the Subduer of all things, to Whom all of creation submits because of His power and strength and the perfection of His Might.

Al-Wakeel (the Trustee). He is the One Who is in a position to run the affairs of His creation, by His knowledge and the perfection of His power and His encompassing wisdom. He is the One Who is taking care of His close friends, making the right way easy for them and causing them to steer clear of the wrong way. He is taking care of all their affairs, and whoever puts his trust in Him will find that He is Sufficient for him.
“Allah is the Walee (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light…” [al-Baqarah 2:257 – interpretation of the meaning].
Dhoo’l-Jalaali wa’l-Ikraam (Possessor of Majesty and Honour), i.e., the Possessor of Might and Pride, the Possessor of Mercy and Generosity, Who is kind to everyone and to specific individuals. He honours His close friends and devoted worshippers who glorify Him, extol His greatness and love Him.
Al-Wudood (the Loving). He loves His Prophets and Messengers and their followers, and they love Him. He is dearer to them than everything else. He has filled their hearts with love for Him and their tongues utter words of praise to Him. Their hearts are drawn to Him in love and sincerity and they turn in repentance to Him at all times.
Al-Fattaah (the Opener). He judges between His slaves according to His laws, His decrees and His decisions concerning reward and punishment. By His Grace He opens the eyes of those who are sincere, and opens their hearts to know Him, love Him and turn to Him in repentance. He opens the door to all kinds of mercy and provision for His slaves, and generates the causes by means of which they can earn good things in this world and the next.
“Whatever of mercy (i.e., good) Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter…” Faatir 35:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
Al-Razzaaq (the Provider), Who provides for all His slaves. There is no living creature on earth, but Allah provides for it.
His provision for His slaves is of two types:
General provision, which include the righteous and immoral, the first and the last. This is the provision of physical needs.
Specific provision, which is provision for the heart which is nourished with knowledge and faith, and the halaal provision which helps a person to adhere to religion. This provision is specifically for the believers, and is given to varying degrees according to His wisdom and mercy.
Al-Hakam (the Judge), al-‘Adl (the Just). He judges between His slaves in this world and the next, with His justice and fairness. He does not oppress anyone in the slightest, and no one is made to bear the burden of another person’s sin. He does not punish a person more than he deserves for his sin, he restores to people their rights and does not leave anyone without restoring what is his right. He is just in His running of the universe and in His decision making.
“… Verily, My Lord is on a Straight Path (the truth)…”
[Hood 11:56 – interpretation of the meaning].
Jaami’ al-Naas (Gatherer of the People). He will gather all of mankind on the Day concerning which there is no doubt. He has comprehensive knowledge of their deeds and their provision, and there is nothing, major or minor, that He is not aware of. He will gather every particle of their bodies that has disappeared or been changed into something else, of all the people who have died from the earliest times until the latest times, by the perfection of His power and the vastness of His knowledge.
Al-Hayy (the Ever-Living), al-Qayyoom (the Self-Sustaining). He is completely alive and sustains Himself, and He sustains and cares for the people of heaven and earth. He controls their affairs and provides for them. The name al-Hayy encompasses all the qualities of His essence and the name al-Qayyoom encompasses all the qualities of His deeds.
Al-Noor (the Light). He is the Light of the heavens and of the earth, Who enlightens the hearts of the ‘aarifeen (those who have proper knowledge of Him) with knowledge of Him and fills their hearts with the light of His guidance. He is the One Who illuminates the heavens and the earth with the lights that He has placed therein. His veil is Light and if it were to be removed, everything of His creation as far as He can see would be burnt, may He be glorified.
Badee’ al-Samawaati wa’l-Ard (Originator of the heavens and the earth). He is the One Who created them and formed them with the utmost beauty and with the most magnificent system of organization.
Al-Qaabid (the Constrictor), al-Baasit (the Expander). He is the One Who takes people’s souls, and Who provides them with ample provision and expands their hearts. All of this is in accordance with His Wisdom and Mercy.
Al-Mu’ti (the Giver), al-Maani’ (the Withholder). No-one can withhold what He gives, and no one can give what He withholds. All interests and benefits are sought from Him, and the needs of all are addressed to Him. He is the One Who gives them to whomever He wills and withholds them from whomever He wills, by His Wisdom and Mercy.
Al-Shaheed (the Witness). He is the One Who watches over all things and hears all voices, loud and soft. He sees all that exists, great and small alike. His knowledge encompasses all things, and He is the Witness Who sees all the deeds of His slaves, good and bad alike.
Al-Mubdi’ (the Originator), al-Mu’eed (the Restorer). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And it is He Who originates the creation, then will repeat (after it has perished)…”
[al-Room 30:27]
He initiated their creation, in order to test them as to which of them would be best in deeds, then He will re-create them in order to reward with good those who did well, and punish those who did evil.
He is the One Who initiated His creation in stages, and Who is constantly renewing it.
Al-Fa’’aal lima yureed (the One Who does whatever He wants). This has to do with the perfection of His power and the strength of His will and ability. Everything He wants, He does, with nothing to stop Him and no one to oppose Him, and with no support or help, no matter what it is. If He wants something, all he has to do is say “Be!” and it is. Although He can do whatever He wants, His will operates in conjunction with His Wisdom, may He be praised, so He is described as being completely Able and being Strong of will, but also as being completely Wise in all that He has done and will do.
Al-Ghaniy (the Self-Sufficient), al-Mughni (the Enricher). He is independent in and of Himself, and is completely Independent in all aspects, because of His perfection and the perfection of His attributes. Nothing can undermine His perfection and make Him imperfect in any way whatsoever. He cannot be anything but Self-Sufficient, because this self-sufficiency is one of His essential qualities, just as He cannot be anything but the Creator, the Able, the Provider, the Kind, Who does not need anyone else at all.
He is the Self-Sufficient in Whose hands are the treasures of the heavens and the earth, the treasures of this world and of the Hereafter. He gives His creation enough in general terms so that they do not have to seek help of anyone else, and He gives to specific people of the divine knowledge and realities of faith with which He has filled their hearts.
Al-Haleem (the Forbearing One). He is the One Who showers His creation with blessings both apparent and hidden, in spite of their sins and many mistakes. He is Forbearing and does not punish sinners straight away for their sins. He rebukes them so that they will repent, and gives them time to turn to Him in repentance.
Al-Shaakir (the Grateful), al-Shakoor (the Appreciative). He is the One Who appreciates the smallest deed, and forgives the greatest mistakes. He multiplies beyond measure the deeds of those who are sincere; He appreciates those who give thanks to Him, and He remembers those who remember Him. Whoever draws near to Him with something of righteous deeds, He draws near to him by more than that.
Al-Qareeb (the Ever-Near), al-Mujeeb (the Responsive). Allah, may He be glorified, is near to everyone, and His nearness is of two types:
His nearness to everyone in a general sense, through His knowledge, watching, awareness and witnessing, which encompass all things.
His nearness in a specific sense, to His slaves, those who ask help of Him and those who love Him. The true nature of this closeness cannot be understood, but its effects may be seen in His kindness towards His slave, and His care, support and help of him. Another of its effects is His response to those who call on Him and His acceptance of the repentance of those who worship Him. He is also the One Who responds in a specific way to those who respond to Him and follow His religion. He also responds to those who are in need and to those who no longer have any hope in any of His creation, and who put their trust in Him, hoping for His pleasure and fearing His wrath.
Al-Kaafi (the Sufficient). He is the One Who gives His slaves all that they need. More specifically, He is Sufficient for the one who believes in Him and puts his trust in Him and asks Him for all that he needs in worldly and spiritual terms.
Al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir (the Last); al-Zaahir (the Manifest), al-Baatin (the Hidden). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this in a clear and comprehensive fashion when he said, addressing his Lord: “You are the First, and there is nothing before You; You are the Last, and there is nothing after You. You are the Manifest and there is nothing above You; You are the Hidden and there is nothing beneath You.”
Al-Waasi’ (the All-Encompassing). His attributes and qualities, and everything that has to do with Him, are all-encompassing in such a way that no one can praise Him as He deserves, but He is as He praised Himself, vast in power, might and dominion, and vast in grace and kindness, and vast in generosity and munificence.
Al-Haadi (the Guide), al-Rasheed (the Guide to the Right Path). He is the One Who guides His slaves and shows them the way to all that will benefit them, and protects them from all that will harm them. He teaches them what they do not know, and guides them to the true guidance which will help them and set them straight. He fills them with taqwa (piety) and causes their hearts to turn to Him, in response to His command.
The name al-Rasheed has a meaning akin to that of al-Hakeem: He is Wise in word and deed, and all His laws are good and wise. His creation testifies to His wisdom.
Al-Haqq (the Truth). He is true in and of Himself and in His attributes. His existence is undeniable, and His attributes are perfect. His existence is one of His essential qualities (He cannot but exist), and nothing else can exist except through Him. He is the One Who has always been and will always be described with attributes of majesty, beauty and perfection. He has always been and will always be known for His Kindness. His words are truth; the meeting with Him is truth; His Messengers are truth; His Books are truth; His religion is the Truth; the worship of Him Alone, with no partners or associates, is the Truth; everything that has to do with Him is truth. Allah is the Truth and whatever else they claim to be divine besides Him is false. Allah is the Most High, the Most Great, as He says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And say: ‘The Truth is from your Lord.’ Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve…”
[al-Isra’ 18:29].
“… So, after the truth, what else can there be, save error?…”
[Yoonus 10:32]
“And say: ‘Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Surely, falsehood is ever bound to vanish.’”[al-Isra’ 17:81]"
813,2601,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2601,"Destroying a place
    of evil without anyone knowing","Question

                They are building a nightclub in my
      community and we have tried to no avail to stop this. This will bring great immorality and
      corruption to our community, both to Muslims and non-Muslims. According to the shari'ah,
      is it allowed to destroy this place if no one is caught and the owner will lose all the
      money he invested in it. Is this an acceptable form of reducing evil as commanded in the
      Quran?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to our shaykh, Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan
    al-Barraak, who answered as follows:
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Let there arise out
    of you a group inviting to all that is good, enjoining al-Maruf (Islamic monotheism
    and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbidding al-munkar (polytheism and all that
    Islam has forbidden) [Aal Imraan 3:104]. 
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Whoever of you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking
    action against it], and if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out against it],
    and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong], and this is the
    weakest of faith. (Reported by Muslim, no. 70).
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): So
    keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can [al-Taghaabun 64:16].
With regard to the evil thing that you mention in the question, you should
    try to change it or get rid of it as much as you can, so that you eliminate it or at least
    reduce it. This can be done by taking the matter to the people in authority who have the
    power to eliminate it or move it to another area, or by talking to the owner of the site
    and asking him to stop investing in evil which will only cause harm to him in this world
    and the next, and to invest in something that will be of benefit to him and the people
    living in the neighbourhood, without causing them any harm in either their spiritual or
    worldly affairs. 
As for taking action by destroying the nightclub, as mentioned in the
    question, this is not permitted, even if the one who does this is sure he will not get
    caught. The evil resulting from such an action is too great, such as the destruction of
    property which is it not permissible to destroy, and the accusation and torture of
    innocent people that is bound to happen during the investigation of the incident.
    Moreover, the owners of the nightclub may not give up, and are most likely to try again to
    build the place. Beware, my zealous brother, of being too hasty to change evil things
    without thinking about the consequences. It is a good job that you asked this question so
    that matters might become clear to you, which they surely are now. And Allaah is the Guide
    to the Straight Path."
814,2602,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2602,Shaving the hairs    on the testicles and around the anus,"Question

I have a question about shaving hairs below navel. I don't know how far down to go. Should the hairs from the testicles be also removed. Please shed some light on this.
And what about women are they also suppose to shave their hairs?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
In the Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. This is not part of the Sunan al-Fitrah, but if there are too many hairs then they should be removed, so that they do not get contaminated with any impurity when using the toilet.
There are reports in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which indicate that the pubic hairs should be removed, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The fitrah consists of five things, one of which is removing the pubic hairs. (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also set a time limit of forty days, and the hair should not be left any longer than that,because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: He set us a time limit of no more than forty days for trimming the moustache, clipping the nails, plucking the armpit hairs and shaving the pubic hair. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/284 and Muslim, 1/222).
The fuqaha discussed the proper etiquette of removing the pubic hair and said that it is mustahabb to start shaving the pubic hair from beneath the navel, and to start on the right hand side, and one should also be concealed from the sight of others when doing this. One should also bury any hair or nail clippings removed.
The reasons behind removing this dirty hair could also be applied to the hair on the testicles and around the anus, if impurity (najaasah) gets attached to it, because the purpose it to be comepletly clean and pure and keep away from anything that may cause dirt and impurities to cling to the body. In this case, removing this hair is a good thing. With the regard to women, the rulings on removing the pubic hair are the same as the rulings for men. And Allaah knows best."
815,2606,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2606,"The meaning of    thinking about going for jihaad, and combining da’wah and jihaad","Question

                Assalaau Alaykum,
My dear respected Shaikh,
I am an undergraduate student studiying in the field of  Computer Engineering in University of XXXXX . InshaAllah I will be graduating next year. Alhamdulillah I am married and expecting a kid very soon ! InshaAllah. Alhamdulillah I make efforts to gain knowledge and implement it upon the way of Salaf-us-Salih and I know this is the right way . But there is one thing I do not reallyunderstand : that is the issue of Jihaad. InshaAllah please do clarify this for me in the following context:
1. My obligation with regards to Jihaad
2. The meaning of the Hadith : Whoever dies and did not fight in battle, nor did he have the sincere wish to fight in battle, dies on a branch of hypocrisy. [Muslim]
3. How do I prepare for Jihaad.
4. How should I weigh the affair between gaining knowledge, Da'waf and Jihaad.
I would also like to know what the major Ulama say with regards to this.
Jazakallahu Khairan.",,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh: Chapter: Condemnation of the one who dies without having gone out for jihaad or having thought of doing so. Then he quoted the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever dies without having gone out for jihaad or having thought of doing so, dies on a branch of hypocrisy.
(Saheeh Muslim, 3533).
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is that the one who does this is behaving, in this regard, like the hypocrites who stay behind and do not go out for jihaad, because not engaging in jihaad is one of the branches of hypocrisy. This hadeeth also indicates that the one who intended to do an act of worship but died before he could do it is not to be condemned to the same extent as one who died without any such intention.
Al-Sindi said, in his footnotes to Sunan al-Nisaa'i: without having thought of [it] means without having said to himself, I wish I could go out for jihaad. Or it could mean that he did not intend to go out for jihaad, and the sign of intending to go out for jihaad is preparing equipment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have made some preparation for it [al-Tawbah 9:64].
A person can prepare himself for jihaad in many ways, such as:
Learning the virtues of jihaad and the rulings concerning it;
preparing oneself with different kinds of acts of worship;
training oneself to make sacrifices;
forcing oneself to prefer others to oneself;
spending for the sake of Allaah;
studying and reading the biographies of mujaahideen and heroes of Islam;
studying Islamic battles;
constantly telling oneself that if jihaad is established and one has the means and is able to go for jihaad, there is no choice but to enlist;
knowing how sinful it is to run away from the battlefield or flee before the kuffaar;
studying the Seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during both the Makkan and Madani periods, and studying his battles and campaigns, to see how he conducted the jihaad in the context of his own circumstances, what he started with and how he prepared himself;
understanding that jihaad has to go through stages, beginning with the nearest enemy, until one reaches the stage of being able to fight all the mushrikeen;
being aware of the movements of hypocrisy;
waging jihaad on four fronts against ones own nafs or base self, against the Shaytaan, against the kuffaar and against the hypocrites;
understanding the importance of waging jihaad with ones wealth as well as with ones self.
Know, my brother, that it is not difficult to combine jihaad with dawah, because each of them has its own time and place. When the mujaahideen were waging their conquests, they used to call people to Allaah before the battle started. When they conquered a country, they would call its people to Islam and teach them the religion. When there was no battle or jihaad going on, the doors of dawah were still wide open, and they would make dawah to their wives, children, relatives, neighbours and all people, Muslim and non-Muslim, calling them with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and arguing with them in a way that is better. May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

                As-salaa-mu 'alai-kum
  I would like to convert to Islam but I have my reservations on food,
      especially pork. I am still staying with my Chinese parents whereby pork is a very regular
      dish. If I were to convert and still stay at home, I am afraid that I may take pork cooked
      with say chicken without my knowledge.
     During family get-together dinners/functions, try as I can, I having been
      trying to avoid the pork dish and I can just ask for God's forgiveness when I cannot avoid
      it. If I were to convert and later have to consume pork, can I still ask for God's
      forgiveness?
  I am really very disturbed with this issue and appreciate your advice.
     Thank you.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no blessing in this world like embracing Islam, and there is no
    misfortune, sin or tribulation in this world like staying in kufr (disbelief). The created
    being must enter the religion of the Creator, and not wish for any other religion except
    Islam. The Creator knows the situation of His creatures and understands their inabilities,
    weaknesses, forgetfulness and mistakes, and so He forgives us for mistakes that are made
    unintentionally. Allaah does not ask anyone to do anything that is beyond his abilities,
    as he says (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah burdens not a person beyond
    his scope [al-Baqarah 2:286]. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah will forgive my ummah for their mistakes, and for
    what they forget, and for what they are forced to do. (Reported by Ibn
    Maajah, 2033; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 1731).
    What you have mentioned in your question  that you
    may eat something haraam without realizing  is not something for which you will be
    punished. As long as you are going to do your best to avoid what Allaah has prohibited
     which is what you have indicated in your question  then there is no sin on
    you. Even if a person does commit a haraam deed, Islam still offers a way out from every
    sin, in the form of repentance, remorse, determination not to repeat the sin, and seeking
    forgiveness from Allaah. This guarantees that the sin will be erased. So go ahead with
    determination, and do not hesitate. Allaah will be with you and will not let you down so
    long as you are following the religion with which He is pleased. May Allaah help you and
    keep you on the Straight Path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.."

first i wish to state that this q&a is very beneficial to the ummah mash'Allah and we hope you and your helpers will receive the best reward in this world and the next.  my question is on behalf of a muslim young man. he is mash'Allah a sincere seeming and knowledgeable muslim who follows islam to the best of his ability and upon the correct aqeedah. he lives alone with his divorced mother whose does not follow islam thoroughly and engages in very unislamic activities sometimes. i know both him and his mother and they are very close and very kind but i see that the son i sometimes put in situations that are extremely stressful for him and i cannot advise him properly. a few examples of these situations include the mother going out of the house in shorts and the son hating this shame but walking with her for fear that she will be accosted, or the mother being overly freindly with male acquaintances in the western manner, or going to dinner and sitting at a table where alcohol is being consumed though the mother does not consume it. there are various other types of scenarios that try this brother such as his mothers' friends advocating every kind of bidah. he does say what is wrong and try to give dawah to his mother but it is usually ignored as ""extremism"" or ""from the stone age"". please advise, my freind is confided in me only that he feels like a dirty ""dayouth"" and wants to know if staying with his mother is the correct thing given such behavior on her part. he errs on the side of staying with his mother even when she is adamant about wearing unislamic clothing for fear of her being molested be some stranger. also he did not tell me of these things and reveal his families faults, rather it is evident for those arouind to see as well as for me to see as his friend. please help and mat Allah ta'Aalaa reward you with the good.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that the story you have told us is very sad and moving, especially when we see someone suffering because  the person who is closest to him is lacking in terms of religion.  But ‘Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs for us.’ [Aal- ‘Imraan 3:173 – interpretation of the meaning] ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ [al-Baqarah 2:156 – interpretation of the meaning].
 This brother should remember that honouring one’s parents is one of the most important duties that human beings have towards one another, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks to Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination.  But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly…” [Luqmaan 31:14-15].  These mushrik parents were doing their utmost to make their son associate partners with Allah, yet in spite of that Allah commanded the son to maintain a relationship with them and behave kindly with them in this world.  So you are also obliged to treat your mother well, advise her to give up her bad behaviour, explain to her how sinful her deeds are and what punishment awaits her if she does not stop.  If she responds, then praise be to Allah. If she does not, then keep away from her in a good way; do not mix with her in ways that will adversely affect your religion, but do not upset her either.  Behave with her in the world kindly, and continue to advise her from time to time.  Your keeping away from her will not be a sin, if you do it for the sake of Allah and in opposition to something wrong. 
(See the response of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Fatawaa Islamiyyah, 4/196; al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah fi Fatawaa Islamiyyah (Standing Committee on Islamic Fatwas), 4/204; Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen in Fatawaa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/957) 
In conclusion therefore, if your staying with her will benefit her by increasing her religious commitment and eemaan, her adherence to Islamic duties and her avoidance of haraam deeds – or at least reduce her involvement in such activities – because she feels that she is being watched, for example, or because this will keep bad people away from her, and this will not cause you any harm at the same time, then stay with her in the hope of earning reward for whatever efforts you make, and Allah will reward you for your patience.  If you have already tried your utmost, to no avail, and have found that you are not making progress in any of the ways referred to above, and staying with her will have an adverse effect on your own religious commitment or reputation, then there is no sin on you if you keep away from her, as stated above, so long as you continue to check on her from time to time, to pay attention to her needs and to advise her. We ask Allah to bless you with patience and reward you for your efforts, for He is the best of supporters and helpers."

    of 2, 4, 6 or 8 rakahs, prayed after the sun has risen and before the time for Zuhr
    approaches. It is better to delay it until the day is hotter, the evidence for which is as
    follows:
From Zayd ibn Arqam who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to the people of Qubaa and
    found them praying. He said: Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up

    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to or entered the mosque at
    Qubaa after the sun had risen, and found the people there praying. He said:
    Salaat al-Duhaa should be prayed when the young camels lift up their feet (because

According to a report narrated by Muslim from al-Qaasim al-Shaybaani, Zayd

 (peace and blessings of

Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase
    Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up their feet (because of the heat
    of the sand) refers to when the sand becomes unbearably hot from the suns
    heat, and burns the soles of the young camels feet, so they alternately raise and
    lower their feet in response to the heat of the sand. Al-Awwaab means
    one who is obedient, or one who turns to obedience. The hadeeth also refers to the best
    time to offer this prayer, although it is permissible to pray it any time after the sun
    has risen and before it reaches its zenith. (Sharh Muslim lil-Nawawi). And Allaah knows best."

    to the unlawful sexual intercourse (zinaa). Verily it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an

Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Allaah says,
    forbidding His slaves to commit zinaa, to approach it or to put themselves in situations
    that may lead to it or tempt them to it: ‘And come not near to the unlawful sexual
    intercourse. Verily it is a faahishah’ i.e., a great sin, and ‘an evil
    way’ i.e., a bad way of behaving.”
Imaam Ahmad said: “Yazeed ibn Haaroon told us that Jareer told us
    that Saleem ibn ‘Aamir told us, from Abu Umaamah that a young man came to the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah,
    grant me permission to commit zinaa.’ The people turned to him and told him off,
    saying, ‘Ssh!’ The Prophet

    his sin, purify his heart and make him chaste.’ After that, the young man never paid
    attention to anything of that nature.” 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who
    invoke not any other god along with Allaah, not kill such life as Allaah has forbidden,
    except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse – and whoever does this
    shall receive the punishment. The torment shall be doubled to him on the Day of
    Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe,
    and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and
    Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good
    deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allaah with sincere repentance.” [al-Furqaan
    25:68-71]
It is not permitted for a man guilty of zinaa to marry a woman who is
    similarly guilty unless both of them repent sincerely to Allaah, may be He be glorified,
    so that they will no longer be described as being guilty of zinaa. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication
    marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: not let any but a such a man or
    an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers, such a thing is forbidden.”
    [al-Noor 24:3]
So you must repent sincerely to Allaah, and follow this kabeerah
    (major sin) with many good deeds, so that Allaah may forgive you. If you are both sincere
    in your repentance and adhere to the laws of Allaah from now on, there is nothing wrong
    with your marrying her. Allaah forgives the one who repents."

I have also been told that she cannot wash or comb her hair. The latter especially seems contrary to Islam regarding cleanliness. 
A detailed response would be greatly appreciated. Jazakum Allahu khayran","No woman should mourn for a dead person for more than three days except for a husband, in which case the period of mourning is four months and ten days.","Praise be to Allah.How long should a woman mourn her husband?
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days, then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no sin on you if they (the wives) dispose of themselves in a just and honourable manner (i.e., they can marry). And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do. [Al-Baqarah 2:234]
And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honourable (e.g., lawful marriage). And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. [Al-Baqarah 2:240]
Umm `Atiyyah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: No woman should mourn for a dead person for more than three days , except for a husband, (in which case the period of mourning is) four months and ten days . She should not wear any coloured clothes, only simple dress. She should not apply kohl to her eyes, or use perfume, except for a little qust or izfar (types of perfume), when she cleans herself after finishing her period. (Muslim, 2739)
Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan reported that when the news of her father’s death reached her, she called for some perfume and wiped it on her forearms, and said: I do not need it, but I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: It is not permitted for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for any dead person for more than three days, except for a husband, (in which case the period of mourning is) four months and ten days. (Al-Bukhari, 4926)
Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The woman whose husband has (recently) died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower or mishq (a reddish clay), or dye her hair, or use kohl. (Al-Nasai, 3479, and others)
Zaynab bint Ka’b ibn ‘Ujrah reported that al-Furayyah bint Malik ibn Sinan, the sister of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri, told her that she came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him whether she should go back to her people among Banu Khudrah. Her husband had gone out in pursuit of some rebellious slaves of his, and when he caught up with them at the edge of al-Qadum, they killed him. She said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whether I should go back to my family, because my husband had not left me a place to live that belonged to him, or any money for provisions. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said yes, so I started to leave, and I had reached the hujrah (room) or the mosque, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called me or told someone to call me. So I came back, and he asked me, What did you say? I repeated the story I had told him about my husband. He said: Stay in your house for the specified length of time. So I spent my `iddah there, four months and ten days. At the time of ‘Uthman, he sent word to me asking about this, so I told him, and he followed what I said and judged in accordance with it. Muhammad ibn Bashshar told us that Yahya ibn Sa’id informed us that Sa’d ibn Ishaq ibn Ka'b ibn ‘Ujrah informed us of something similar. Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: This is a sahih hasan hadith. The majority of scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others followed this hadith and did not allow a widow to move out of her husband’s home until her `iddah was over. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1125)
How should a widow observe her `iddah?
On the basis of the texts quoted above, the scholars have defined the rules governing widows and described how the widow's mourning should affect her life. These rules may be summed up as follows:

It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to use perfume, whether on her body or on her clothes
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to adorn herself with things like henna or facial make-up, or to use kohl unnecessarily, or to use anything else that may make her beautiful and attractive to others.
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to wear attractive clothes, such as clothes dyed with safflower or saffron, or other types of red dyes and colours that are used for adornment.
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to wear jewellery.
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to spend the night outside her own home , meaning the home of her deceased husband, except for some Islamically legitimate reason, such as her being afraid for her own safety, or being evicted by the landlord of rented premises, etc. If a recently-widowed woman needs to go out for medical treatment, to attend legal proceedings in court, to take exams in school , or to go shopping when she has no-one who can do this for her, then she should do these things during the day, so long as she comes back home to her husband’s house before Maghrib (sunset).
She is forbidden to marry or draw up a marriage contract; even engagement is forbidden, unless it is merely hinted at and not stated clearly.

From the above, it is clear that Islam gives the husband immense rights. The wife should give up wearing adornments and perfume, and should stay in her husband’s home during this period because of those rights. These rules also pay attention to her psychological state at this time when she has lost her support. 
Even though these rules are so clear, many people have still fallen prey to many different kinds of bid`ah when it comes to mourning, so they forbid a woman to do things that are not forbidden in Islam, and they fabricate lies and introduce bid`ah into the Religion of Allah. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-’Aziz ibn Baz said:
“Some people may think and imagine that a recently widowed woman should not speak to anyone, or speak to anyone on the telephone, or have a bath more than once a week, or walk barefoot in her house, or go outside in the moonlight, or other such nonsense which has no basis. But in fact she is allowed to walk barefoot or with shoes in her house, to do whatever she needs to in her house, to cook food for herself and her guests, to walk in the moonlight on the roof or in the garden of her house, to take a bath whenever she wants, to speak to whomever she wants so long as it is decent talk, to shake hands with other women and with her mahram relatives (close relatives such as father, brother, etc.) but not with non-mahrams, and to remove her head covering so long as there are no non-mahrams present. She should not use henna, saffron or perfume, and she is not allowed to get engaged. A hint is permissible but not a clear statement. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Fatawa Islamiyah, 3/316)
Ruling on wearing black in mourning for the dead
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibrin said: 
“Wearing black to mourn the deceased is a form of bid`ah , and the wives of the deceased only need to avoid fancy clothes, adornment, jewellery, makeup and perfume during the mourning period. Neglecting regular work during the mourning period is also a form of bid`ah. The recently widowed woman should still take care of cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, laundry, etc., and there is no sin involved in doing so. And Allah knows best. (Al-Lulu al-Makin, 39)
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin said:
“Wearing special clothes to accept condolences is a form of bid`ah, in our opinion, because it could indicate that one is discontent with the decree of Allah, may He be glorified. (Fatawaa al-Ta’ziyah, 38)
He also said:
“Wearing black as a sign of mourning is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement a person should do what is taught by Islam, which is to say: Inaa Lillahi wa innaa ilayhi raji’un. Allahumma’jurni fi musibati wakhluf li khayran minha (To Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, recompense me for my affliction and replace it for me with something better). As regards wearing some special clothing, such as wearing black and so on, this has no basis, and it is false and reprehensible conduct.” (Fatawa Islamiyah, 3/313)
And Allah knows best."

    those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who
    ascribe partners to Allaah, but if you persevere patiently, and become al-muttaqoon
    (pious), then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs, and that is from
    the great matters, [which you must hold on to with all your efforts] [Aal
    Imraan 3:186]. 
If what is being said or done by others is causing too much
    psychological pain, then how much worse must it be when it is done by the closest of
    people, one with whom you share ties of flesh and blood, the mother who gave birth to you?
The hurt caused by those who are related to you is more bitter
    and painful/ to the soul than the blow of a sword. [poetry]
But when the believer is exposed to the most painful attacks from the
    closest of people to him, he does not give in or retreat; he follows the Quraan in
    his dealings with the mother who is hurting him or cutting him off and turning away from
    him. This is illustrated in the following story:
Musab ibn Sad ibn Abi Waqqaas reported from his
    father the mother of Sad swore that she would not speak to him, or eat or
    drink, until he renounced his religion (Islam) and became a kaafir. She said, You
    claim that Allaah tells you to honour and respect your parents. I am your mother and I am
    telling you to do this. She stayed like that for three days, until she fell
    unconscious from exhaustion. One of her sons, whose name was Umaarah, got up and
    gave her water to drink, and she began to pray against Sad. Then Allaah revealed the
    following aayah of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): And We have
    enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents But if they (both) strive
    with you to make you join in worship with Me other of which you have no knowledge, the
    obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly [Luqmaan 31:14, 15].
    (Reported by Muslim, 4432).
    The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) also suffered rejection at the hands of some of those who were most closely related
    to him, such as his paternal uncle Abu Lahab, but this did not stop him from spreading the
    message and conveying the religion, despite the harshness of the opposition. Rabeeah
    ibn Abbaad al-Dayli, who later became Muslim, said: I saw the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with my own eyes in the
    marketplace of Dhool-Majaaz, saying, O people, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah
    and you will prosper. He was going through the alleyways of the market, and the
    people were gathering around him. I did not see anyone saying anything, and he did not
    stop saying, O people, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and you will prosper.
    Behind him there was a man with a squint and a handsome face, and his hair in two braids,
    saying, He is a Sabian and a liar. I asked, Who is this? They
    said, Muhammad ibn Abd-Allaah, who is saying that he is a Prophet. I
    asked, Who is this who is denouncing him? They said, His paternal uncle
    Abu Lahab. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 15448).
    So, my sister, you should hold fast to your religion and
    honour and respect your mother as Allaah commands. If she turns away from you and rejects
    your kind treatment, there will be no sin on you, even if this hurts you, because you are
    following the true guidance. Bear this with patient perseverance, for you are on the right
    path of truth. And Allaah is the Source of strength."

Is it a must to wash your hair after intercourse to be considered clean?",Washing the hair when doing ghusl (full ablution) after having intercourse is obligatory. This ruling does not differentiate between men and women.,"Praise be to Allah.Can you do ghusl without washing hair?
Washing the hair when doing ghusl (full ablution) after having intercourse is obligatory. The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah who said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl after having intercourse, he would start by washing his hands, then he would pour water with his right hand onto his left hand and wash his private parts, then he would do wudu as for prayer, then he would take the water and put his fingers in his hair till he reached the roots, and when he saw that the water had reached the roots, he would pour water over his head three times. Then he poured water over the rest of his body, then he washed his feet. (Muslim, 474) 
Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin said in his commentary on Bulugh al-Maram (p. 399): 
“This also indicates that it is obligatory to make the water reach the roots of the hair when doing ghusl after intercourse, and if the hair is thick , one does this by putting one's fingers in one's hair and pouring water over one's head three times after the water has reached the roots of the hair.
Does a woman have to undo her braid when doing ghusl?
This ruling does not differentiate between men and women , but the scholars did discuss undoing the hair if it is braided, in the case of women who do ghusl after intercourse and after finishing their period. 
The most correct view is that it is not obligatory to undo braided hair . The evidence for this is the hadith of Umm Salamah, who said: I said, O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who braids her hair, should I undo it to do ghusl after having intercourse? (According to another report, she said: and after my period?) He said, No. It is enough for you to pour water on your head three times. ( Muslim)
Further evidence is to be seen in the hadith of ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr, who said: ‘Aishah heard that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar was commanding women to undo their braids when they did ghusl. She said, “This is very strange on the part of Ibn ‘Umar! He is telling women to undo their braids when they do ghusl. Why doesn’t he tell them to shave their heads?!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl using one vessel, and I never did more than pour water on my head three times. (Muslim, 331)
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin said in his commentary on Bulugh al-Maram (p. 406):
“This hadith speaks about women doing ghusl: do they have to undo these braids and wash what is underneath them or not? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that it is not obligatory to undo them every time, because this is too difficult, especially in the case of ghusl after intercourse. There is a difference of scholarly opinion on the matter. Some scholars said that it is obligatory for women to undo their braids when doing ghusl after their periods, but not when doing ghusl after having intercourse. The difference between the two is obviously that ghusl after intercourse is done frequently, and it would be too difficult for a woman to undo her braids in the morning and put them back in the evening or vice versa, but ghusl following one’s period is usually done only once a month, so it is easy for a woman to undo her braids for this purpose.”

      Is it permissible for a man to marry his uncles wife after their
      divorce? What would his rights be towards the kids, since they are his cousins? Thanking
      you. Allah's blessing be on you.",,"Praise be to Allah.A man is permitted to marry the wife of his maternal uncle, if they
    divorce and after she has completed her iddah (waiting-period after divorce). An
    uncles wife is not a mahram (close relative to whom marriage is permanently
    forbidden), so there is nothing wrong with marrying her. But it is forbidden for a man to
    have any kind of haraam relationship with his uncles wife. Shaytaan could make
    something that is bad appear attractive to them, so it is essential to exercise caution.
    Also, it is not permitted to make her hate her husband so that she will get divorced and
    one can then marry her. One should try to reconcile and reunite, not destroy and break up.
    In principle, it is better for the children to stay with their father and mother in one
    family unit, unless the interests of shareeah in this case dictate otherwise. If the
    worst comes to the worst, and they get divorced, and there is no suspicion about your role
    in all this, then there is nothing wrong with marrying the woman who has been divorced by
    your uncle. Your treatment of your uncles children (your cousins), if they should
    come under your care, should be fair and proper, based on the ties of kinship between you.
    If you treat them well, doing so sincerely for the sake of Allaah, then you will have a

825,2662,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2662,Prescribed means of warding off sihr (witchcraft) before it happens,"Question

What are the prescribed means of warding off sihr before it happens?.",,"Praise be to Allah.Among the most important means of warding off the danger of sihr before it happens is seeking protection through the adhkaar (dhikr) prescribed in Islam, making du`a and reciting prayers seeking refuge that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). These include: 
1 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy [al-Baqarah 2:255] after every prescribed prayer, after reciting the adhkaar which are prescribed after the salaam. 
2 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy when going to sleep. This is the greatest aayah in the Qur’aan, in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah! Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great”
[al-Baqarah 2:255]
3 – Reciting “Qul huwa Allahu ahad”, “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Falaq” and “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Naas” [i.e., the last three soorahs of the Qur’aan] following every prescribed prayer, and reciting these three soorahs (three times) at the beginning of the day after Fajr prayer, and at the beginning of the night after Maghrib prayer. 
4 – Reciting the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah at the beginning of the night. These are the aayahs in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ‘We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’ — and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’
Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawlaa (Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people”
[al-Baqarah 2:285-285]
And it was narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Aayat al-Kursiy at night will have ongoing protection from Allah and no devil will come near him until morning comes.” And it was also narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, that will suffice him.” The meaning – and Allah knows best – is that that will be sufficient protection for him against all evil. 
5 – Seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created, night and day and when stopping to rest anywhere, be it in the city, in the desert, in the air or on the sea. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever stops to rest and says, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allah il-taammah min sharri ma khalaq  (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” 
6 – The Muslim should say at the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night (three times): “Bismillaah alladhi laa yadurr ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa laa fi’l-samaa’i wa huwa al-samee’ al-‘aleem (In the name of Allah with Whose name nothing on earth or in heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing).” According to saheeh reports, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to recite this, and this is a means of keeping safe from all evil. 
These adhkaar and prayers for refuge are among the greatest means of warding off the evil of sihr (witchcraft) and other evils, for the one who recites them regularly with sincerity and faith, putting his trust in Allah and depending upon Him, and being content with that. 
They are also some of the most effective weapons for warding off sihr after it has happened, along with humbly beseeching Allah constantly and asking Him to remove the harm and relieve the distress. Among the du`a’s which have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to treat diseases such as sihr and other things is the ruqyah by means of which he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to treat his companions: “Allahumma Rabb al-naas, adhhib il-ba’s, washfi anta al-Shaafi laa shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’an laa yughaadir saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the harm and heal him, for You are the Healer and there is no healing except Your healing, with a healing which does not leave any disease behind).” There is also the ruqyah by means of which Jibreel treated the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Bismillah urqeeka min kulli shay’in yu’dheeka, wa min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin haasid Allah yashfeek, bismillaah urqeek (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from every thing that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” This should be repeated three times.

826,2665,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2665,"Meaning of the hadith, “Treat women kindly”","Question

The hadith says, “Treat women kindly, for woman was created from a bent rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is the top part…” Please explain the meaning of this hadith, especially the phrase “and the most crooked part of the rib is the top part”.",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a saheeh hadith which was narrated by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim] in al-Saheehayn from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Treat women kindly, for woman was created from a bent rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is the top part, so treat women kindly.” 
This is a command to husbands, fathers, brothers and others to treat women kindly and not to oppress them; to give them their rights and to guide them to do good. This is what is obligatory upon everyone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Treat women kindly.” This is not altered by the fact that a woman may sometimes mistreat her husband or relatives with her words or actions, because she was created from a rib as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and the most crooked part of it is the top. It is well known that the top of it is the part by which it is attached, so the rib will have some crookedness in it at that point, as is well known. 
The meaning is that she will inevitably have some crookedness or shortcomings in her character. Hence it was narrated in another hadith in al-Saheehayn: 
“I have not seen any lacking in rational ability and failing in religion but (at the same time) robbing the wisdom of the wise, besides you [women].” 
The point is that this is the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadith of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him). What is meant by lacking in rational ability, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, is that the testimony of two women is equivalent to the testimony of one man. Failing in religion, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, means that women spend days and nights without praying, i.e., because of menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding.  This is a shortcoming which Allah has decreed for them, and there is no sin on them because of that. 
So women should accept this in the way that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) meant it, even if a woman is knowledgeable and pious, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not speak of his own whims and desires, rather that was a Revelation that was revealed to him, which he conveyed to the ummah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).
Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred.
Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.
It is only a Revelation revealed” [al-Najm 53:1-4]"

                Does a woman who is employed have to pay the household expenses? Her husband is saying that if she does not pay the household expenses, she will not be allowed to work at all.
Does her husband have any right to the salary which she gets for her work? If she does have to pay towards the household expenses, how is that to be divided between her and husband?",,"Praise be to Allah. 
          They should come to some agreement concerning this issue 
          – the sharing of household expenses between a husband and wife who both 
          go out to work and earn a living – and avoid any dispute concerning 
          it.
 
          With regard to how that should be done, this depends 
          on a number of things, as discussed below:
 
          1 – If your husband stipulated in the marriage contract 
          that expenses are to be shared otherwise he will not let you work, then 
          the Muslims are bound by their conditions, as the Prophet SAWS (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
 
          “The Muslims are bound by their conditions, except for 
          conditions which forbid something that is permitted or permit something 
          that is forbidden.” And he SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
          him) said:
 
          “The conditions which are most deserving of fulfilment 
          are those by means of which sexual intimacy becomes permissible for 
          you.”  
 
          So you are bound by the conditions you made, if you made 
          any conditions [in your marriage contract].
 
          2 – If you did not make any conditions, then the household 
          expenses are all the responsibility of the husband, and the wife does 
          not have to pay any of the household expenses; he is the one who has 
          to pay them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Let the rich man spend 
          according to his means”
[al-Talaaq 65:7]
 
          And the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
          upon him) said: “You are obliged to spend on them and clothe them according 
          to what is reasonable.”
 
          So spending is the obligation of the husband. He is the 
          one who should take care of the household needs and his own needs and 
          those of his wife and children. (The wife’s) money and salary belong 
          to her, because that is given in return for her work and her efforts. 
          (The husband) draw up the marriage contract on that basis, and he did 
          not stipulate any condition that she should pay the household expenses, 
          or half of them, etc. – unless she gives up any part of her salary of 
          her own good pleasure,  
“but if they, of their 
          own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it 
          without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:4]
 
          But if the marriage contract was drawn up on the basis 
          of any such condition, then the Muslims are bound by their conditions.
 
          But we advise you to give up part of your salary to your 
          husband in order to please him and to resolve the dispute and solve 
          the problem, so that you may live in peace and harmony. So agree upon 
          something between yourselves, such as one half of the salary, or one-third, 
          or one-quarter, etc., so that the problem will be solved and so that 
          love and harmony may take the place of conflict. Or perhaps he will 
          agree and be content with what Allaah has decreed for him, and he will 
          spend according to his means, and he will forego all of your salary 
          and have some pride concerning the matter. But if that is not possible, 
          then there is no reason why you should not refer the matter to the courts 
          in the city where you live, and whatever the shar’i court decides will 
          be sufficient, in sha Allah. May Allaah help you both."

Can a moslem say: I am a momen In shaa Allah",,"Praise be to Allah.The issue of whether one can add the condition of saying “in sha Allah” when speaking about matters of faith is one concerning which there has been lengthy and detailed debate among the scholars. The correct attitude in this case is to ask what is meant by the word “mu’min” (believer). If the speaker is referring to the essence of faith, i.e., Islam, without which one would be a kaafir, then in this case it is not correct to say “in sha Allah.” This would imply some doubt about Islam, which is not permitted; the Muslim should be definite in his faith, and should say “I am a mu’min,” without adding “in sha Allah.” However, if what is meant is the perfection of faith and the high rank which is above the level of just being a Muslim, then one should say “in sha Allah,” because otherwise one would be praising oneself, which is forbidden as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Therefore ascribe not purity to yourselves” [al-Najm 53:32]
If a person wants to say something straightforward to express his belief, then he should say “I am a Muslim.” In this case there is no need to add “in sha Allah.”

Hello, my name is XXXX and I was taking a look at your web page. I am interested in it because I am in a Religious Studies class and I am interested in learning more. I just wanted to know your response to this,
if I am correct in saying this...
In Islam heaven is thought of as paradise of wine, women and song. It is achieved by living a life in which, ironically, one abstains from the things with which he or she will be rewarded in paradise. In addition to this abstention, one must follow the five Pillars of Islam.
It seems to me that the Islamic faith is a do-it-yourself proposition.
Follow this ""way of life"", they say, and you will gain favor with God and eventually achieve salvation. There is NO assurance. I would hate to live like that. I realize that Muslims do not believe in ""original sin"", but regardless of whether or not a man is born sinful or not, would you not agree that every man/woman is sinful? How does one pay for his/her sin?
I understand repentance. I agree with that...but it seems as though one can NEVER do enough to win favor with God. That is why He sent his Son to die for us. All of our sins past, present and future.
There is no possibility of assurance in the Islamic faith. I think that would be an awful way to live knowing that I was never gonna make it...not knowing of my salvation until the ""day of judgement"" whether or not I have done enough ""goodworks"" or prayed enough...etc.
I have asked a couple of Muslims in my class whether or not they were for sure if they were going to ""paradise"" or ""heaven"" when they died. I have not yet had one reply in the affirmative. Rather, they referred to the imperfection of their lives as being a barrier to this realization. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE IN ISLAM, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ATONEMENT, AND SALVATION DEPENDS WHOLLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S GAINING   ENOUGH ""MERIT""
Also, if I wanted to become a Muslim, I couldn't. If Muslims think that they are the ""chosen people"" then why aren't they spreading their faith.
Do you just have to be lucky enough to be born Muslim? If a person wants to become a Christian they can. ANYONE can become a Christian in a matter of seconds. All they have to do is confess that Jesus Christ is who He said He was and repent and believe...that is all a lot easier said than done. But basically that is it. I wasn't born Christian...or raised Christians assert that Jesus Christ is the only way to God because
Scripture says, ""Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. (Acts 4:12) Jesus Christ said himself
""I am the way the truth and the life, NO ONE comes to the Father except through me...""
He didn't say, I am one way or a way or one truth etc....THE WAY!!!
I and the Father are ONE! Jn 5:18
I just don't understand how anyone could be blind to these facts. Unless they are never told. Which was me.
I would just like a little feedback","According to the Islamic ‘aqidah:
•	The pleasures of Paradise are not merely physical in nature, they also include the joy of feeling safe and secure, and of being content with God and being close to Him.
•	Salvation can only be attained through fulfilling commands, not just by avoiding things that are forbidden.

Are the pleasures of Paradise merely physical?
What you have mentioned about the Islamic belief about Paradise, and the enjoyment of wine , women and song therein, falls wide of the mark. The pleasures of Paradise are not merely physical in nature, they also include the joy of feeling safe and secure, and of being content with God and being close to Him. 
The greatest joy of all in Paradise will be seeing God , may He be glorified and exalted. When the people of Paradise see the Holy Face of God, they will forget all other kinds of pleasures that they have enjoyed. There is in Paradise everything that will delight the heart and eye; no dirty or evil talk is heard there, nor sinful speech. 
No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do. [al-Sajdah 32:17 interpretation of the meaning]. 
What I am trying to say is that the delights of Paradise are not limited to the kind you refer to in your question. They are far greater than that.
Will the entrance to Paradise only be granted to those who heed certain prohibitions?
You mention the idea that entrance to Paradise will only be granted to those who heed certain prohibitions, which they will enjoy in Paradise in the Hereafter as a reward for avoiding it in this life. 
This generalization is not correct at all. Islam is a religion which commands action, not just abstinence. Salvation can only be attained through fulfilling commands, not just by avoiding things that are forbidden. 
Moreover, not every luxury in Paradise will consist of something that was forbidden in this world and is now being given as a reward. Some of the delights of Paradise will be things that were allowed in this world, such as marriage, good fruits like pomegranate and figs, etc., drinks like milk and honey, and so on. All of these are permitted in this world, and will be delights to be enjoyed in Paradise. 
The bad qualities of things that are forbidden in this world will not be present in their heavenly forms. For example, the wine of Paradise, as Allah tells us, causes neither ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, sin, etc.) nor intoxication (see al-Saffat 37:47). It does not rob a person of his mental faculties, or cause headaches and stomachaches. It is quite different from its earthly counterpart. 
The point I am making is that the delights of Paradise do not consist only of allowing things that were forbidden in this world. It is also worth pointing out that there are cases where abstention from prohibited things will not be rewarded by being given their equivalent in the Hereafter, whether those prohibited things are food, drinks, deeds or words. Poison, for example, will not be given as a luxury in Paradise, although it is forbidden in this world.
The same applies to sodomy, incest and other things which will not be allowed in the Hereafter although they are forbidden in this world. This matter is quite clear, praise be to Allah.
Does every person have a guarantee of Paradise?
The idea of being guaranteed Paradise, and that a person’s life will be as horrible and unbearable as you describe if he has no such guarantee, is a misconception which itself leads to the results you mention. 
If you were to say that every person has a guarantee of Paradise , this would be utterly disastrous, because then everyone would commit all kinds of forbidden acts, feeling safe because of this guarantee. 
Many of the crimes committed by Jews and Christians have been done on the basis of this guarantee, with documents of forgiveness from their priests. Allah has told us about such people (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they say, None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. Say, Produce your proof if you are truthful.” [Al-Baqarah 2:111]
For us Muslims, Paradise is not the matter of our own desires or the desires of anyone else, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians); whoever works evil will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allah.” [Al-Nisa 4:123]
Islamic view regarding a guarantee of one’s destiny
There follows a brief summary of the Islamic view regarding a guarantee of one’s destiny.

Islam offers a guarantee to every sincere Muslim who obeys Allah and remains in this state of devotion until he dies, that he will definitely enter Paradise. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meanings):

“But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow (i.e., in Paradise), to dwell therein forever. Allah's promise is the truth, and whose words can be truer than those of Allah? (Of course, none).” [Al-Nisa 4:122]
“Allah has promised those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e., Paradise).” [Al-Maidah 5:9]
“(They will enter) ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which the Most Beneficent (Allah) has promised to His servants in the unseen: verily, His promise must come to pass.” [Maryam 19:61]
“Say: Is that (torment) better, or the Paradise of Eternity promised to the muttaqin (pious and righteous persons)? It will be theirs as a reward and final destination.” [Al-Furqan 25:15]
“But those who fear Allah and keep their duty to their Lord (Allah), for them are built lofty rooms, one above another, under which rivers flow (i.e., Paradise). (This is) the Promise of Allah, and Allah does not fail in (His) promise.” [Al-Zumar 39:20]

Islam also guarantees the disbeliever who ignores the commands of Allah that he will definitely enter Hell. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):

“Allah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell, therein shall they abide. It will suffice them. Allah has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment.” [Al-Tawbah 9:68]
“But those who disbelieve, for them will be the Fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die, nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!” [Fatir 35:36]
Allah will say to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgement (interpretation of the meaning):
“This is Hell which you were promised! Burn therein this Day, for that you used to disbelieve!” [Ya-Sin 36:63-64]
Allah will not go back on His promise to either the believers or the disbelievers. He describes how both of them will be at the end of the Day of Judgement (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire (saying): We have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you also found true, what your Lord promised (warnings, etc.)? They shall say, Yes. Then a crier will proclaim between them: The Curse of Allah is on the zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.).” [Al-A’raf 7:44]
Everyone who believes and does righteous deeds, and dies in this state, will definitely enter Paradise. Everyone who disbelieves and does evil deeds, and dies in this state, will definitely enter Hell.
One of the great guiding principles of Islam is that the believer should tread a path between fear and hope. He should not take it for granted that he will enter Paradise, because this will make him complacent, and he does not know in what state he will die. Nor should he assume that he is going to Hell, because this is despairing of the mercy of Allah, which is forbidden.
So the believer does righteous deeds, and hopes that Allah will reward him for them, and he avoids evil deeds out of fear of the punishment of Allah. If he commits a sin, he repents in order to gain forgiveness and protect himself from the punishment of Hell. 
Allah forgives all sins and accepts the repentance of those who repent. If a believer fears that the good deeds he has sent on before him are not enough, as you suggest, then he will increase his efforts, in fear and hope. 
No matter how many righteous deeds he has sent on before him, he cannot rely on them and take them for granted, or else he will be doomed. He keeps striving and hoping for reward, and at the same time he fears lest his deeds be contaminated with any element of showing off, self-admiration, or anything that will lead to them being rejected by Allah. Allah describes the believers (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charity, etc.) have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their Lord (for reckoning).” [Al-Muminun 23:60]
So the believer keeps on striving, fearing and hoping, until he meets his Lord, believing in Tawhid (Divine Unity) and doing righteous deeds, and earns the pleasure of his Lord and Paradise. If you think about the matter, you will realize that these are the right motives for action, and that righteousness cannot be achieved in this life in any other way.
Islamic view on original sin
As regards what you say about original sin, this matter needs to be approached from several angles.

Firstly: The Islamic belief concerning human sin is: the individual bears the responsibility for his own sin ; no one else should bear this burden for him, nor should he bear the burden for anyone else. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden.” [Fatir 35:18] 

This refutes the idea of original sin. If the father commits a sin, what fault is that of his children and grandchildren? Why should they bear the burden of a sin that someone else committed?
The Christian belief that the descendants should bear the sin of their father is the essence of injustice. How can any sane person say that the sin should be carried down the centuries by all of humanity, or that the children, grandchildren and subsequent descendants should be tainted because of their father’s sin?

Secondly, making mistakes is a part of human nature. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Every son of Adam is bound to commit sins.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2423), but Allah has not left man unable to do anything about the mistakes that he makes. He gives man the opportunity to repent, and so the hadith (words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) quoted above concludes: and the best of those who commit sins are those who repent. The mercy of Allah is clear in the teachings of Islam, as Allah calls His servants (interpretation of the meaning): “Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Zumar 39:53]

This is human nature, and this is the solution to the problem of sin. But to make this human nature, which is bound to make mistakes, a barrier between the servant and his Lord which will prevent him from ever earning the pleasure of God, and to say that the only way to reach God is through His sending His (so-called) son down to earth to be humiliated and crucified while his father looks on, so that mankind could be forgiven, is an extremely odd idea. Just describing it sounds so unlikely that there is no longer any need to refute it in detail. 
Once, when discussing this issue with a Christian, I said, If you say that God sent down His son to be crucified to atone for the sins of the people alive at his time and afterwards, what about those who had come before and died as sinners before the time of Christ, and had no opportunity to know about him and believe in the Crucifixion so that their sins might be forgiven? All he could say was: No doubt our priests have an answer to that! Even if they do have an answer, it is bound to be concocted. There is no real answer.
If you really examine the Christian teaching on human sin with an open mind, you will see that they say that God sacrificed His only son to atone for the sins of mankind, and that this son was a god. If it was true that he was a god who was beaten, insulted and crucified, and died, then this doctrine contains elements of blasphemy because it accuses God of weakness and helplessness. Is God really incapable of forgiving the sins of all His servants with just one word? If He is Able to do all things (and the Christians do not dispute this fact), then why would He need to sacrifice His son in order to achieve the same thing? (Glorified and exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say about Him!)
“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife? He created all things and He is the All-Knower of everything.” [Al-An’am 6:101 interpretation of the meaning]
An ordinary man would not accept anyone harming his child; he would come to his defence, and would never hand him over to an enemy who would insult him, let alone leave him to face the worst kind of death. If this is the attitude of a mere created being, what then of the Creator?

Thirdly, the Christian doctrine of original sin has a negative effect because, as you have mentioned, it does not require any duties of man other than to believe that God sent His son to this earth to be crucified and to die to atone for the sins of mankind. 

Thus a person becomes a Christian and is to earn the pleasure of God and be admitted to heaven. Moreover, the Christian believes that everything that happened to the son of God was only to atone for his sins, past present and future, so there is no need to wonder why Christian societies have seen such an increase in murder, rape, robbery, alcoholism and other problems. After all, did not Christ die to atone for their sins, and haven’t their sins been wiped out, so why should they stop doing these things?
Tell me, by your Lord, why do you sometimes execute murderers, or put criminals in jail, or punish them in other ways, if you believe that the criminals' sins have all been atoned for and forgiven through the blood of Christ? Is this not a strange contradiction?
Why do Muslims make da`wah?
You ask why, if the Muslims are the chosen people of mankind, they do not spread their religion . The fact of the matter is that sincere Muslims have always sought to do just that. How else could Islam have spread from Makkah to Indonesia, Siberia, North Africa, Bosnia, South Africa and all parts of the world, East and West? 
The faults in the behavior of some modern Muslims cannot be blamed on Islam; those faults are the result of going against Islamic teachings. It is not fair to blame the religion for the faults of some of its adherents who have gone against it or gone astray. 
Are Muslims not being more just than Christians when they affirm that the sinner is threatened with the punishment of Allah unless he repents, and that for some sins there is a deterrent, a punishment to be carried out in this world as an expiation for the Hereafter, as in the case of the punishments for murder, theft, fornication/adultery, etc.?
Is it difficult to become a Muslim?
What you say about it being so easy to become a Christian, as compared to becoming a Muslim, is clearly mistaken. The key to Islam is no more than two simple phrases: Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wa anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah). 
With these few words, a person enters Islam in a matter of seconds. There is no need for baptism or priests, or even to go to a certain place such as a mosque or anywhere else. 
Compare this with the ridiculous procedures of baptism which the Christians do when they want to admit someone to the Church. Then there is the fact that the Christians venerate the cross on which Jesus was tortured and crucified in great pain as they claim. They take it as a sacred object of blessing and healing, instead of scorning it and hating it as a symbol of oppression and the worst possible way for the son of God to die!
Muslims are closer than others to the truth
Do you not see that the Muslims are closer than others to the truth, because they believe in all the prophets and messengers, respecting them all and recognizing that all of them taught the truth of Divine Unity (Tawhid) and that each of them was appointed by Allah and sent to his people with laws that were appropriate to the time and place? 
When the fair-minded Christian sees the followers of Islam believing in Musa (Moses), ‘Isa (Jesus), and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all) and in the original Torah and Gospel, as well as the Quran, and sees his own people denying the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and rejecting the Quran, wouldn’t his open-mindedness make him think that the Muslims are most likely to be right?
Did Jesus say ‘No one comes to the Father except through me’?
You say that the Messiah said, No one comes to the Father except through me. We need, first of all, to be sure that these words can truly be attributed to Jesus. Secondly, this is clearly not true. How then could mankind have known God at the times of Nuh (Noah), Hud, Salih, Yunus (Jonah), Shu’ayb (Jethro), Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and other prophets? 
If you were to say that during the time of Jesus (upon whom be peace) and up to the time of the Final Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the Children of Israel had no other way to know the religion of Allah except through the way of Jesus, this would be correct.
Does the statement ‘I and the Father are one’ prove Jesus’ divinity?
You quote the Messiah as saying, I and the Father are one . This is clearly not correct. If we examine the matter objectively, without letting our own desires get in the way, it becomes clear that the conjunction and in the phrase I and the Father implies that two separate entities are involved. I is one entity, and the Father is another. If you say, So-and-So and I, it is obvious to any rational person that they are two separate people. The equation 1+1+1=1 makes no sense to any rational person, whether he is a mathematician or not.
Finally, I advise you (and I do not think that you will reject this advice) to think deeply about what you have read, putting aside your background, any preconceived ideas, your own desires and feelings of attachment to your religion or culture, and to seek guidance sincerely from Allah. Allah is Most Generous and will never let any of His servants down. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path, and He is Sufficient for us and is the best disposer of affairs.
And Allah knows best."

What is the ruling on praying in parks (public gardens), knowing that they are watered with water that emits an offensive odour? It is my understanding that this water is taken from sanitary overflows or from wells into which leaks water that contains impure substances. Should the people be stopped by the Committee from praying in these parks? I hope that you can explain the correct view concerning this matter.",,"Praise be to Allah.So long as there is an offensive odour coming from it, then praying in them (the parks) is not correct, because one of the conditions of prayer being correct is that the place where the Muslim prays should be taahir (pure and clean). If he spreads out a thick and taahir (pure) mat, then his prayer will be valid. 
But it is not permissible for Muslims to pray in parks – even on thick and pure mats – rather they have to pray with their Muslim brothers in the houses of Allaah – the mosques – of which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In houses (mosques) which Allaah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify Him (Allaah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,
Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allâh (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).
That Allaah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And Allaah provides without measure to whom He wills”
[al-Noor 24:36-38]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call (to prayer) and does not come, then his prayer does not count, unless he has a (valid) excuse.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-Daraaqutni, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. Its isnaad is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim). 
A blind man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, I have no guide to bring me to the mosque. May I have a dispensation to pray in my house?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then respond.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). 
And there are many ahaadeeth which say the same thing. 
What the Committee for Enjoining what is Good and Forbidding what is Evil should do is to disallow people to pray in parks, and tell them to pray in the mosques, in accordance with the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
 and 
“The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)” [al-Tawbah 9:71]
And in accordance with the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking actions); if he cannot then with his tongue (by speaking out against it); and if he cannot then with his heart (by feeling that it is evil) – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh)."

                What is the ruling on a Muslim
      leaving something to a kaafir in his will, so long as it does not exceed one-third of the
      estate? What is the ruling on the opposite, i.e., can a Muslim accept money from a kaafir
      if he leaves it to him in his will?",,"Praise be to Allah.The Hanafi, Hanbali and most of the Shaafa'i fuqahaa are agreed
    that it is OK for a Muslim to leave something to a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Islamic
    rule) in his will, and vice versa, so long as this is within the guidelines of
    shareeah. Their evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah
    does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on
    account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those
    who deal with equity. [al-Mumtahinah 60:8]. Also, being a kaafir does not
    disqualify a person from ownership, and as it is OK to sell to a kaafir or give him a
    gift, it is also OK to include him in ones will.
Some of the Shaafais think that it is OK only if a specific
    person is named, such as saying I leave [such and such] to so and so; but if a
    person says I leave [it] to the Jews and Christians, this is not OK because it
    sounds as if he is making their kufr the reason for leaving something to them. The
    Maalikis agree with others that it is OK for a non-Muslim to leave something to a Muslim.
    With regard to a Muslim leaving something to a non-Muslim, Ibn al-Qaasim and Ashhab said
    that it is allowed if it is done for a reason, such as upholding family ties, otherwise it
    is makrooh, and should not be done at the expense of a Muslim. No one would do such a
    thing except one whose faith is diseased. (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah,
    2/312)
    Unfortunately, nowadays we see some Muslims, especially
    those who are living in kaafir countries, leaving huge sums of money to Christian, Jewish
    or other kaafir organizations, on the basis that these are charitable, educational or
    humanitarian organizations and so on, but there is no way that Muslims can benefit from
    this. The only ones who benefit from it are the kuffar, and their hungry oppressed refugee
    Muslim brothers are left with no h elp or support. This is a sign of weak, diluted faith
    and of allegiance to and admiration of the kuffaar and their disbelieving societies. We

    separate wudoo for each prayer when the time comes, even if he has just made
    wudoo for another prayer a short time before. This is because the Prophet 
    taught the woman who suffers from istihaadah (prolonged non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) to
    do this. Aaishah said: Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh came to the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I
    am a woman who experiences istihaadah and I do not become clean from bleeding. Should I
    forget about salaah? He said: No, that is from a vein; it is not menses. When
    your period starts, then stop praying, and when it ends, wash the blood from your body and
    pray again. Abu Muaawiyah said in his hadeeth: He said: Do
    wudoo for each prayer, until the time for the next prayer comes
    Abu Eesaa said: The hadeeth of Aaishah is a saheeh hasan hadeeth,
    and this is the opinion of more than one scholar among the Companions of the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Taabieen. It is also the opinion
    of Sufyaan al-Thawri, Maalik, Ibn al-Mubaarak and al-Shaafii that when the woman who
    suffers from istihaadah finishes her regular period, she should do ghusl, then do
    wudoo for each prayer. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 116; the hadeeth was
    reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 221).
    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The
    ruling on non-menstrual blood (istihaadah) is the same as the ruling on anything that
    breaks wudoo: she should do wudoo for each prayer, but she should not pray
    more than one fard prayer with that wudoo, whether she is praying on time or is
    making up the prayer later, because of the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, You
    should do wudoo for each prayer. This is the opinion of the majority of
    scholars. (Fath al-Baari, Kitaab al-hayd, Bab al-istihaadah).
    The same ruling applies to the person who suffers from continual incontinence or wind. You
    can pray as many naafil prayers as you like with the wudoo you made for a fard
    prayer, until the time for that fard prayer is over. And Allaah knows best."

837,2734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2734,Is it possible to see Allah in this world?,"Question

I have read that no man has seen Allah (S) in this life, not even the prophet (SM) in his mira'j. The book has been written by Sk. Abu Ameenah Bilaal Philips. Now, I have heard from one scholar from my country that Imam Malik saw Allah (S) hundred times in his dream. Is that possible?",,"Praise be to Allah.Seeing Allah in reality (as opposed to in a dream) is not possible in this life, although no doubt it will happen after death. This is not because seeing Him is impossible in itself, but because Allah has willed that it should not happen. This is for many reasons, some of which have been found by the scholars, and others which remain known only to Allah. Among the reasons which we do understand is human weakness, which is apparent from the story of Moosa (upon whom be peace), which we will quote shortly. Another reason is that seeing Allah is a great blessing and joy, indeed it is the greatest blessing, so it is withheld for the place of ultimate blessing and joy, namely Paradise. Another reason is that this world is a mixture of good believers and kuffaar, so this blessing is deferred until it will be given exclusively to the believers in Paradise. Withholding this blessing until the Hereafter also provides a strong motive to do good in this world, so that one may see Allah and feel secure and content in nearness to Him in the Hereafter.
Evidence that it is not possible to see Allah in this world


Allah says, in the story of Moosa (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): And when Moosa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You. Allah said, You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain, if its stands still in its place, then you shall see Me. So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Moosa fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said, Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers. [al-Araaf 7:143]. The word lan (here translated as cannot in You cannot see Me) conveys the meaning of You will not see Me in this life, because there is evidence that man will see Allah in the Hereafter, which means that this lan is not eternal in application. (The negative particle lan often carries a sense of eternal negation, that something will never happen, but this is not the case here. Translator).


Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all vision. He is the Most Subtle and Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things. [al-Anaam 6:103]. The commentator al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his tafseer of this aayah: Concerning the phrase No vision can grasp Him, several comments regarding it have been narrated from the imaams of the salaf, one of which is that it means, you will not be able to see Him in this world, even though you will see Him in the Hereafter. The reports that state this, narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), reach the level of mutawaatir and are reported through more than one sound isnaad in the books of Saheeh, Musnad and Sunan.


[Translators note: a mutawaatir report is one that was narrated by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie].
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He will by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise. [al-Shoora 42:51].
Abu Hurayrah said: Some people said, O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? He said, Do you have any doubt about seeing the sun on a cloudless day? They said, No, O Messenger of Allah. He said, Do you have any doubt about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night? They said, No, O Messenger of Allah. He said, You will see Him just as clearly on the Day of Resurrection
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6088). It is clear that the idea that Allah will not be seen in this life was well-entrenched in the minds of the Sahaabah. They were asking about the Hereafter, and this is what the Prophets answer also referred to.
Abu Dharr said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Have you seen your Lord? He said, (There is) light, how could I see Him? This light, which prevented him from seeing Him, is a veil of light, which is further explained in the hadith of Abu Moosa, who said, The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and told us five things: Allah does not sleep, and it is not befitting that He should sleep. He lowers the scale and lifts it. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. If He were to withdraw it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation as far as His sight reaches.
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad and Muslim, 263).
Further clear evidence comes in the hadith which warns against the Dajjaal (antichrist): Written between his eyes is (the word) kaafir, which will be read by everyone who hates his works, or every believer will read it. Know that none of you will see your Lord until he dies.
(Reported by Muslim, 5215).
So any claim that anyone but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can see Allah in reality is impossible, according to the consensus of the scholars. However, there is some disagreement among the scholars as to whether or not the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Allah on the night of the Miraaj. The correct view is that he did not see Him physically, with his own two eyes, because when he was asked about this, he said, (There is) light, how could I see Him? According to another report, he said, I saw light. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not see Him, but he saw His veil of light.
The question of whether Allah may be seen in a dream does not contradict the fact that Allah cannot be seen in reality in this world, because all the texts quoted above speak about physical vision when one is awake, not the vision of the heart when one is asleep. Proof that the latter kind of vision is possible is to be seen in the hadith about the dispute of the chiefs on high (the angels). Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, My Lord came to me tonight in the most beautiful form. I think he said, in a dream. He said, O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high disputed about? I said, No. He put His hand between my shoulder-blades and I could feel its coolness on my chest (or just beneath my throat), then I knew everything that is in the heavens and on earth. He said, O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high disputed about? I said, Yes. He said, About expiation, and expiation is staying in the mosque after prayers, walking to join congregational prayers, and doing wudoo properly in adverse conditions. Whoever does that will live a good life and die a good death, and will be as sinless as the day his mother bore him. He said, O Muhammad, when you pray, say Allahumma innee asaluka fal al-khayraat wa tark al-munkaraat wa hubb al-masaakeen, wa idha aradta bi ibaadika fitnatan faqbudni ilayka ghayra maftoon (O Allah, I ask you to make me do good deeds and avoid evil deeds, and to make me love the poor and wretched. If You want to test Your slaves, then take me unto You without subjecting me to the trial). Ones status in Paradise may be raised by spreading the greeting of salaam, feeding others, and praying at night when people are sleeping.
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16026; and by al-Tirmidhi, 3159, who said it is a saheeh hasan hadith).
Some of the scholars have commented that it is possible to see Allah in a dream.
Imaam al-Daarimi said, in his refutation of Bishr ibn Ghiyaath, This seeing took place in a dream, and in a dream it is possible to see Allah in any shape or form. (p. 166)
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, A believer may see his Lord in a dream, in various forms according to his faith and belief. If his eemaan is correct, he can only see Him in a beautiful form, and if his faith is lacking, this will be reflected in the way he sees Him. Seeing Allah in a dream is not like seeing Him in reality. It may have different interpretations and meanings referring to something in reality.(al-Fatawa, 3/390)
He also said, Whoever sees Allah in a dream sees Him in a form that corresponds to his own state. If he is righteous, he will see Him in a beautiful form, which is why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him in the most beautiful form.(al-Fatawa, 5/251)
Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz was asked about the ruling concerning one who claims to have seen the Lord of Glory in a dream, and whether it was true, as some claim, that Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal had seen the Lord of Glory in his dreams more than one hundred times. The Shaykh answered as follows:
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and others said that it is possible for a man to see his Lord in a dream, but what he sees is not reality, because there is nothing like Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. [al-Shoora 42:11]. Nothing in His creation is like unto Him. A person may dream that his Lord is speaking to him, and no matter what kind of image he sees, that image is not Allah, because there is nothing that is like Allah in any way. Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned that dreams differ according to the state of the person who is dreaming. The more righteous and closer to goodness a person is, the more correct his dream will be, but the truth is still something other than what he sees, because the guiding principle is still that there is nothing like unto Allah.
He may hear a voice and be told such-and-such, or to do such-and-such, without any clear image resembling anything in creation, because there is nothing at all like unto Allah Some people may imagine that they have seen their Lord when in fact this is not the case. The Shaytaan may deceive a person and make him imagine that he is their Lord, as it was reported that he made Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelaani see him on a throne above water, and said, I am your Lord and I freed you from doing any duties (worship, etc.). Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelaani said, Get lost, O enemy of Allah! You are not my Lord, because the commands of my Lord are not cancelled for anyone, or some similar words.
As for whether Imaam Ahmad saw his Lord, I do not know if this is true or not. It is said that he saw his Lord but I do not know if this is true.
And Allah knows best."

839,2750,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2750,Why do Muslims say “Al-hamdu Lillah” after they sneeze?,"Question

 
I was wondering if you could explain why Muslims say, ""Alhumdulliah"" after they sneeze? Please reply as soon as possible...",,"Praise be to Allah.It was proven in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah likes the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning, so if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says “al-hamdu Lillaah”), it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, “Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).” As for yawning, it is from the Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, he should suppress it as much as he can, for when any one of you yawns, the Shaytaan laughs at him.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/505)
It was also reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sneezes, let him say ‘Al-hamdu Lillaah,’ and let his brother or his companion say, ‘Yarhamuk Allah.’ And if he says to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah,’ let him say, ‘Yahdeekum Allahu wa yusliha baalakum (May Allah guide you and correct your thinking).’”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/502)
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that two men sneezed in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said “Yarhamuk Allah” to one of them, but not to the other. The one to whom he did not say it said: “So and so sneezed, and you said ‘Yarhamuk Allah’ to him; I sneezed but you did not say it to me.” He said, “He praised Allah (said ‘al-hamdu Lillaah’) and you did not.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/504)
Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you sneezes and praises Allah, then say ‘Yarhamuk Allah’ to him, but if he does not praise Allah then do not say it.”
(Reported by Muslim 2992)
Sneezing brings a person the blessing of relief by releasing vapours that were trapped in the head which, if they were to remain there, would cause him pain and sickness. For this reason, Islam tells him to praise Allah for this blessing and for the fact that his body is still intact after this jolt that shook him like an earthquake… for sneezing causes a disturbing movement in the body… It was said (concerning the origin of the word “tashmeet” [which is translated here as “saying ‘yarhamuk Allah’, but the original meaning is to tell someone to rejoice at another’s ‘misfortune’]): this is telling him to feel joyful because he has annoyed the Shaytaan by praising Allah for the blessing of sneezing and its association with things that Allah likes. When a person mentions Allah and praises Him, this annoys the Shaytaan in several ways, for example: the act of sneezing itself, which Allah likes; his praising Allah for it; the Muslims praying for mercy for him; and his prayer for them to be guided. All of this annoys the Shaytaan and makes him upset, so the believer is told to rejoice over this annoyance of his enemy. Praying for mercy for the one who sneezes is called tashmeet because it implies that he should rejoice over the annoyance of his enemy. This is a good meaning which people should bear in mind when they sneeze or say ‘yarhamuk Allah’ to one who sneezes, and they should appreciate the blessing of sneezing for the body and mind, and understand why Allah likes it. Praise be to Allah as is His due for He is the Most Generous and Majestic.
The scholar Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) reported that Imaam Ibn Hubayrah said: “Al-Raazi reported from some doctors: sneezing is not a sign of the onset of sickness, unless it is accompanied by catarrh.” Ibn Hubayrah said: “If a person sneezes, this is an indication of good health, sound digestion and physical strength, so he should praise Allah. This is why the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to praise Allah.”
It is also important to know that the Muslim should submit to the texts and act in accordance with them, without trying too hard to understand precisely why a text commands or forbids something. He should believe that Allah is the Wise and Aware, Who does not prescribe anything for His slaves unless it is in their best interests, in this world and the next, even though it may not cross their minds and some people may understand part of the wisdom behind it whilst others will never know. The Muslim’s basic rule is to follow the commands, and if he has some knowledge of the reason behind the commands, then praise be to Allah.
And Allah knows best.
For further details on the rules concerning sneezing, see: Al-Aadaab al-Shara’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 2/334; Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 2/438; Ghadhaa’ al-Albaab by al-Safaareeni, 1/441"

    beggar","Question

                Is it permissible to give a person money if
      he is begging on the street, but he isn't a muslim?",,"Praise be to Allah.The fuqahaa differed as to whether it is
    permissible to give charity to a kaafir. The reason for the difference of opinion is that
    charity means giving something in the hope of earning reward, so will a person be rewarded
    for spending on a kaafir? The Hanbalis said  and it is the well known view of the
    Shaafais and was also reported from Muhammad in al-Siyar al-Kabeer 
    that it is permissible to give charity to kaafirs in general. This is because of the
    general applicability of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And they give
    food, in spite of their love for it (or: for the love of Him) to the poor, the orphan and
    the captive [al-Insaan 76:8]. Ibn Qudaamah said: At that time, captives
    could only have been kaafirs. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: In (the kind treatment of) every living being there is a
    reward. Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said:
    My mother came to visit me and she was a mushrik at the time of the Messenger of
    Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I asked the Messenger of Allaah
    SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), My mother has come to visit me,
    and she does not want to become Muslim. Should I uphold the ties of kinship with my
    mother? He said, Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with your mother.
    Because upholding the ties of kinship is praiseworthy in all religions, and giving to
    others is a noble characteristic. Al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 26.
    If a non-Muslim person is asking, it is either of the
    following cases:
He has an urgent need, such as food, and if he does not receive food he
        will die. In this case you should feed him, unless he is openly hostile towards Islam, in
        which case you should refrain. In cases like this, what is given to him should be charity
        (sadaqah), not zakaah.

His need is not urgent as in the first case, but something may be given
        to a person like this for the purpose of opening his heart and calling him to Islam,
        because this serves the overall purpose of shareeah.

How much is the nisab for zakah with regard to paper money?

2- The nisab for silver is roughly equivalent to 595 grams of silver, so the one who has wealth has to pay 2.5% or 25 out of every 1,000 that he has in currency, after one year has passed.","Praise be to Allah.The value of the nisab [the amount that determines whether zakah is obligatory; anyone who has more than this is obliged to pay zakah] for dollars or other currencies is whatever is equivalent to the value of 20 mithqals [a unit of measurement] of gold or 140 mithqals of silver at the time when the zakah is owed. 
It should be based on whichever of the two works out better for the poor, because the prices of gold and silver vary from time to time and from country to country. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 9/257) and because this will be more beneficial to the poor. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 9/254)
Given that currently the price of silver is lower than the price of gold, the nisab should be based on the price of silver, so if a person’s wealth (in paper money) reaches the nisab on that basis, he has to pay zakah.
The nisab for silver is roughly equivalent to 595 grams of silver, so the one who has wealth has to pay 2.5% or 25 out of every 1,000 that he has in currency, after one year has passed).

846,2807,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2807,Affect of Hajj on the soul and life of a Muslim,"Question

How does participating in Hajj affect the life of a Muslim?.",,"Praise be to Allah.Performing the rituals of Hajj has many virtues and there is a great deal of wisdom behind them. The one who is enabled to understand them and do them is blessed with a great deal of good. We will try to list as many as we can here. 
1-Travelling for Hajj to perform the rituals; his journey reminds him his journey to Allah and the Hereafter. When he travels he leaves behind his loved ones, family, children and homeland, and the journey to the Hereafter is like that too.
2-The one who goes on this journey takes with him supplies that will help him reach the holy land, and this reminds him that for the journey to his Lord, he must have with him provisions that will help him to arrive safely. Concerning this, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness)” [al-Baqarah 2:197].
3-Just as travelling is a kind of torment, the journey to the Hereafter is like that too, and many times greater. Ahead of a person there is the agony of death, death itself, the grave, the gathering, the reckoning, the weighing in the Balance, and al-Siraat (a bridge across Hell, over which all must pass), then Paradise or Hell. The blessed one is the one whom Allah saves.
4-When the pilgrim wears the ihraam garments (two pieces of unsewn white cloth), this reminds him of the shroud in which he will be wrapped. This motivates him to give up sin. Just as he sheds his clothes, he should also shed his sins; just as he puts on two clean white garments, his heart and limbs should also be clean and untainted with sin.
5-When he says at the meeqaat (the point at which pilgrims enter ihraam), “Labbayk Allahumma labbaayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allah)”, which means that he has responded to his Lord, may He be exalted, how can he remain in a state of sin without saying to his Lord, “Labbayk Allahumma labbaayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allah)”, meaning, I have responded to Your prohibition of them. This is the time to give up sin.
6-When he gives up the things that are forbidden when in ihraam, and keeps busy with the talbiyah and dhikr (remembering Allah), this shows the state that the Muslim should always be in. This is a means of training and disciplining himself, because he is disciplining himself by giving up what is basically permitted, but Allah has forbidden it to him in this situation. So how can he transgress the sacred limits that Allah has set for all times and places?
7-When he enters the sacred House of Allah, which Allah has made a place of safety for mankind, this reminds him of safety on the Day of Resurrection, and that no one can attain it without effort and striving. The greatest source of safety on the Day of Resurrection is Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and avoiding shirk (associating others with Allah). Concerning this Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and worship none but Him Alone) and confuse not their Belief with Zulm (wrong, i.e. by worshipping others besides Allah), for them (only) there is security and they are the guided” [al-An’aam 6:82].
When he kisses the Black Stone, which is the first ritual that he does, this trains the visitor to venerate the Sunnah (the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), and not to transgress against the law of Allah on the basis of his flawed reasoning. He knows that what Allah has prescribed for mankind is wise and good, and he trains himself to submit fully to his Lord, may He be exalted. Concerning that, ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, after kissing the Black Stone: “I know that you are just a stone and you can neither cause harm nor bring benefit. Were it not that I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissing you, I would not have kissed you.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1520) and Muslim (1720).
8-When he circumambulates the Ka’bah, that reminds him of his father Ibraaheem (Abraham, peace be upon him), and how he built the Ka’bah as a place of safety for mankind and called them to come on pilgrimage to this House. Then came our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who also called people to come to this House. Moosa (Moses) and ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon them both) also came on pilgrimage to this House, which is therefore a symbol of these Prophets. How could it be otherwise when Allah commanded Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) to build it and venerate it?
9-When he drinks the water of Zamzam, this reminds him of the blessing that Allah has bestowed upon people in this blessed water, from which millions of people have drunk for many centuries, and it still has not dried up. He is encouraged to say du’aa’ (supplication) when drinking it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (3062) and Ahmad (14435). It is a hasan hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/320).
10-The saa’i (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa reminds him of the great hardship undergone by our mother Haajar (Hagar), and how she ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa looking for someone to save her from the trouble in which she found herself, and especially for water to give to her young son Ismaa’eel (Ishmael). This woman bore this test with patience, and turned to her Lord. In her we have a good example, because when a man remembers the striving and patience of this woman, his problems seem less significant, and when a woman remembers one of her own gender, her hardship becomes easier to bear.
11-Standing in ‘Arafah reminds the pilgrim of the great gathering of mankind on the Day of Gathering. If the pilgrim suffers exhaustion because of the crowding together of thousands of people, then how about when all of mankind are gathered, barefoot, naked and uncircumcised?
12-As we said with regard to kissing the Black Stone, so too when stoning the Jamaraat (stone pillars representing the Devil), the Muslim trains himself to be obedient and to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Thus he manifests pure submission to Allah.
13-When he offers the sacrifice, this reminds him of the important incident when our father Ibraaheem submitted to Allah’s command to sacrifice his only son Ismaa’eel (Ishmael), and that there is no room for compassion which goes against the commands and prohibitions of Allah. It also teaches him to respond to the command of Allah, as Ismaa’eel said: “ ‘O my father! Do that which you are commanded, In sha’ Allah (if Allah wills), you shall find me of As‑Saabiroon (the patient)’” [al-Saffaat 37:102].
14-When he exits ihraam and that which Allah had forbidden to him during ihraam becomes permissible to him again, this trains him to be patient, and teaches him that with hardship goes ease, and that the outcome for the one who responds to the command of Allah is joy and happiness. This joy can only be felt by the one who tastes the sweetness of obedience, like the joy that the fasting person feels when he breaks his fast, or that the one who spends the night in prayer feels after he has prayed.
15-When he has finished the rituals of Hajj and done them as Allah has prescribed and as He likes, and has completed his rituals, he has the hope that his Lord will forgive him all his sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) promised when he said: “Whoever comes to this House and does not utter any obscene speech or do any evil deed, will go back as his mother bore him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1449) and Muslim (1350). This motivates him to turn over a new leaf in his life, free from sin.
16-When he goes back to his wife and children, the joy of meeting them reminds him of the greater joy he will feel when he meets them in the Paradise of Allah, may He be exalted. This reminds him that true loss is loss of oneself and one's family on the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): The losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, that will be a manifest loss!” [al-Zumar 39:15]. 
This is what we were able to mention.

847,2808,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2808,Difficulties of Hajj,"Question

                What difficulties are there for a Muslim performing the Hajj?.",,"Praise be to Allah.The difficulties may be summed up as follows: 
1 – Obtaining the visa, because of the large numbers of pilgrims and the small number of visas allocated. 
2 – Tawaaf (circumambulation) around the Ka’bah, when there are many people doing Tawaaf and there is too much crowding, especially at the Black Stone. Hence the people should not push and shove in order to kiss or touch the Black Stone, because that may cause harm that is greater than the reward for doing this action. Similarly the Muslim should choose a suitable time for Tawaaf, when it is less crowded and he can do the act of worship in the required manner. 
The scholars have issued fatwas indicating that it is permissible to do tawaaf on the upper floors of al-Masjid al-Haraam (the Grand Mosque in Makkah), even though that is difficult, because of the greater distance involved – but it is more conducive to performing the act of worship as it should be done, as the Muslim can avoid the pushing and shoving and the bad consequences that may result from that. 
3 – Sa’ee between al-Safa and al-Marwah (running between two hills in Makkah called al-Safa and al-Marwah). The same may be said concerning this as was said above concerning Tawaaf, although the place is smaller than the place for Tawaaf. The Muslim can also do Sa’ee on the upper floor to avoid the crowding on the lower floor. 
4 – Standing in ‘Arafaah, where all the pilgrims gather together at one time in one place, then all they move on at the same time. This is where most people experience difficulties, whether it is in the standing or when moving on. 
5 – Muzdalifah. The difficulties may stem from the absence of services that are available in other places, the most important of which is toilet facilities. 
Hence pilgrims are advised to eat and drink little in ‘Arafaah and Muzdalifah and on all the days of the Hajj in general, so that they will not need to relieve themselves, then find it difficult to find a suitable place, so they will have problems. 
6 – Stoning the Jamaraat (stone pillars representing the devil). This is the most difficult ritual in terms of crowding, and at this time the ignorance of many people becomes manifest when they push and shove their brothers and when they stone the Jamaraat from afar with large rocks that cause harm and injury to their Muslim brothers; some of them are so ignorant that they throw shoes and pieces of wood! 
Hence we advise the pilgrim to avoid the time of peak crowding, which is the forenoon of the first day of Eid, and the time of Zuhr prayer on the other days of al-Tashreeq (the three days following Eid), and to stone the Jamaraat at night when the crowding becomes far less, and he can also remember Allaah in a calm manner. The scholars have issued fatwas stating that the time for stoning the Jamaraat lasts from after the sun passes the meridian (which is when the time for Zuhr prayer begins) until Fajr (dawn), so there is no need to go at the time when the people gather and cause harm to oneself and others and not be able to focus properly when doing this act of worship. 
7 – In Tawaaf al-Wadaa’ (Farewell Tawaaf), when the pilgrims try to leave early to return to their families, so almost all of them gather at the same time, which causes difficulty and harm to them, whether that is in going to the sanctuary, when doing Tawaaf itself or when leaving Makkah. 
Hence we advise pilgrims to delay this ritual until the third of the days of al-Tashreeq and not to be in a hurry. They will earn a greater reward than those who hurry, and they will avoid the intense crowding in Tawaaf al-Wadaa’. 
This is a summary of the difficulties that the pilgrims encounter. The wisdom of Allaah dictates that the rituals should be performed in that land where there is little vegetation, and which is very hot, for great reasons, one of which may be so that Allaah may distinguish His slaves from one another, for no one responds to the call of truth except one who is sincere in his intentions towards his Lord. 
We should realize that these difficulties do not prevent the Muslim from performing this act of worship which Allaah has enjoined in His Book and on the lips of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us that the reward will be commensurate with the degree of difficulty; the more difficult it is, the greater the reward will be.
 It was narrated that the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, the people are going back having done two pilgrimages (Hajj and ‘Umrah), and I am going back having done only one (Hajj – i.e., because her period had come).” He said, ‘Wait, and when you become pure (i.e., when your period ends), go out to al-Tan’eem and enter ihraam from there, then meet us at such and such a place. But it (i.e., the reward) is commensurate with the expenses or hardship involved.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1695; Muslim 1211 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The phrase “But it (i.e., the reward) is commensurate with the expenses or hardship involved” indicates that the reward and the virtue of an act of worship increases the more effort and spending is required. What is meant by hardship is the type of hardship or spending that is not blameworthy or beyond the acceptable limits set by sharee’ah.
Sharh Muslim, 8/152, 153 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented on these words by saying: 
That is undoubtedly correct but this is not always the case. Some acts of worship may be easier than others but they may be of a higher status and bring a greater reward because of the timing, such as spending the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer in contrast to spending the other nights of Ramadaan in prayer; or because of the place where they are done, such as praying two rak’ahs in al-Masjid al-Haraam in contrast to praying many rak’ahs elsewhere; or financial acts of worship (i.e., spending for the sake of Allaah) where some acts are of a higher virtue than others; or physical acts of worship such as fard (obligatory) prayers in contrast to naafil (supererogatory) prayers, although the naafil prayer s may be greater in number and more recitation of Qur’aan may be done therein; or a dirhams of zakaah in contrast to spending large amounts in voluntary charity. This was pointed out by al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd al-Salaam in al-Qawaa’id, where he said: Prayer was the delight of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but it is difficult for others, but the prayer of others, even though it may be difficult, cannot equal his prayer at all. And Allaah knows best.

Is the cheese halal if it is made from enzymes taken from haram meat (not slaughtered according to Shari’ah) as the enzymes still live beyond the animal's lifetime i.e. the enzyme does not die when the animal is killed?","With regard to this issue, the follower (ordinary Muslim) must follow an 'alim who advises him to follow either of these two opinions.","Praise be to Allah.What is animal rennet?
Before answering this question, it is important to know what rennet is.
Al-Fayruzabadi said in al-Qamus al-Muhit (p. 313), under the definition of na fa ha: al-infahah and al-minfahah and al-binfahah all refer to something yellow that is extracted from the stomachs of suckling goat kids.
Infahah (rennet) was also defined in al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyyah as follows: 
""Rennet is a yellowish-white substance ([in a skin vessel] - this phrase appears not to fit here) that is extracted from the stomachs of suckling kids or lambs. When a little of this substance is added to milk, it curdles and becomes cheese. In some Arabic-speaking regions, people call this rennet mujabbinah (cheese-maker), and the stomach (from which the rennet is taken) is called kursh if the animal grazes on grass.”
Is animal rennet halal?
The Islamic ruling concerning rennet is that if it is taken from an animal that has been slaughtered according to Shari'ah, then it is pure (tahir) and can be eaten. This is according to the Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis.
As regards eating rennet taken from an animal that dies naturally, or that was not slaughtered in accordance with Shari'ah, according to the apparent meaning of the opinions reported from the majority of scholars among the Malikis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis, it is impure (najis) and should not be eaten. 
They base this ruling on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): ""Forbidden to you for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals - cattle-beasts not slaughtered)."" [al-Maidah 5:3] - the rennet becomes impure by virtue of the animal's death, and it is not possible to remove that impurity from it.
Imam al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu' (9/68):  
""The ummah has agreed that it is permissible to eat cheese so long as it is not mixed with anything impure, such as adding rennet from a source that is not halal because it was not slaughtered according to shari'ah. This ijma' (scholarly consensus) is the evidence for its permissibility.""
The second view, which is that of Abu Hanifah and is one of two opinions narrated from Imam Ahmad, is that rennet from dead animals or animals that were not slaughtered according to Shari'ah is still tahir (pure). 
This is the opinion which Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah thought most correct in al-Fatawa (21/102), where he said: 
""It is more likely that their (the Zoroastrians') cheese is halal , and that the rennet and milk of dead animals is tahir (pure)."" 
Elsewhere in al-Fatawa (35/154) he said: 
""With regard to the cheese made with their (some of the kafir Batini groups') rennet, there are two well-known scholarly opinions, as is the case with the rennet from animals slaughtered by the Zoroastrians and Christians, and rennet from dead animals, of whom it is said that they do not slaughter their animals properly. The schools of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, according to the other of his two opinions, say that this cheese is halal, because the rennet taken from dead animals is tahir (pure), according to this view, and because the (enzymes in) rennet do not die when the animal dies (so, the concept ""impure containers don't cause the contents of the container to become impure by contact"" ) applies. The schools of Malik, al-Shafi'i and Ahmad, according to the other of his two opinions, state that this cheese is najis (impure), because the rennet is impure according to this view, as they see the milk and rennet of dead animals as impure. In cases where meat is classified as impure because it is not slaughtered properly, the meat is regarded as being the same as dead meat. Both opinions are based on reports narrated from the Sahabah. The first group states that the Sahabah used to eat the cheese of the Zoroastrians, while the second group states that the Sahabah used to eat what they thought was the cheese of the Christians. With regard to this issue, the follower (ordinary Muslim) must follow an 'alim who advises him to follow either of these two opinions.”

Are there any colours which a muslim/muslimah cannot wear eg red garments",,"Praise be to Allah.Before we answer this question we should note an important point, which is that the basic principle regarding colours of clothes for men and women is that all colours are permissible except where there is a shar’i text forbidding a certain colour for men or women. There are shar’i texts which encourage the wearing of certain colours and forbid the wearing of other colours, such as the following:
Black: Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought some clothes, among which was a small black khameesah [garment]. He said, ‘Who do you think we should give this to?’ The people remained silent. Then he said, ‘Bring me Umm Khaalid,’ and she was carried to him. He took the khameesah in his hand and put it on her, and said, ‘May you live long and wear it out.’ There was a green or yellow mark on it, and he said, ‘O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah (good),’ and sanaah is an Abyssinian word.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, wearing a black turban.” (Reported by Muslim). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I made a black burdah (cloak) for the Messenger of Allah ( ) peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he wore it, but when he sweated in it he detected the smell of wool on it, so he took it off, because he used to like pleasant smells.” (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haakim (4/188) said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Saheehah (5/168, no. 2136): It is as they said. Abu Dawood named a chapter in his Sunan “Bab fi’l-Suwaad (chapter on black clothes)”. The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (11/126) said: The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to wear black and that there is nothing makrooh in doing so).
Black is permissible for both men and women alike. One of the false innovations (bid’ah) connected to this colour is the practice of deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said (Fataawa Islamiyah, 3/313): “Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded in Islam, which is to say ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allahumma ajirni fi museebati wa’khluf li khayran minhaa (Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it).’ If a person says this with faith and the hope of reward, Allah will reward him for that and will replace what he has lost with something better.” He also said: “Allocating certain clothes for mourning is an act of bid’ah (innovation) in our opinion, and because it could indicate that a person is discontent with the decree of Allah.”
White: Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he was wearing a white garment and was asleep. I came back to him (later), and he had woken up…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, in a chapter he called Baab al-Thiyaab al-Beed (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported that Sa’d said: “I saw on the left of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing white clothes on the day of Uhud. I never saw them before or since.” These two men were Jibreel and Mikaa’eel, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in al-Fath (10/295). White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Wear your white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p. 82)). White is also the preferred colour for men’s ihraam (special garments for Hajj), which consists of an izaar (lower garment) and a rida’ (upper garment).
Green: Abu Ramthah said: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wearing two green garments.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said, this is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth, and by al-Nisaa’i, 5224).
Red: It was reported that wearing pure red is forbidden for men, but not for women, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade mafdam” (reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 3591). Mafdam is something that is filled with red safflower dye. According to the commentary of al-Sindi on Sunan al-Nisaa’i, mafdam is something that is filled with red. It was reported that if ‘Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, “Leave this for the women.” (Reported by al-Tabari).
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: “A man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not respond.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure).
There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden to wear red, including the following:


because it is the dress of the kuffaar


because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is a way of discouraging the imitation of women


because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear it


The prohibition applies only to garments that are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the red hullah should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara’ (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni hullah usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red.
Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “The clothing (of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)): Abu’l-Waleed told us Shu’bah told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara’ (may Allah be pleased with him) saying: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.’ The hullah consists of an izaar and a rida’ (lower and upper garments)… It is a mistake to think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour. The red hullah is two Yemeni garments woven with red and black stripes like all the other Yemeni garments… But pure red is emphatically forbidden. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade red saddlecloths (or blankets) … With regard to red garments in general and red broadcloth, etc., the issue is still under discussion, but it is very disliked (makrooh).” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/139).

  For a muslim, is it allowed to use drugs like cocaine .
    Here in Columbia 70 % of the people use it . 
    When I want to become a muslim, must I stop it ?
     I am waiting for your answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is a great thing to learn that you are thinking of embracing Islam,
    although you live in a country where drugs are rife and are not following any religion at
    present. We were amazed and impressed to know that a man living in such circumstances has
    reached the point where he wants to become Muslim, but Allaah is able to do all things,
    and He guides whom He wills to the Straight Path. Perhaps the Divine care has been
    preparing you to embrace the true religion in spite of the intense darkness, kufr
    (disbelief) and drug-ridden atmosphere that surround you. The unbelieving man is dead at
    heart even though his body is alive, but when Allaah guides him to the light of Islam, his
    heart awakens and he sees a whole new meaning to life as he starts to follow the guidance
    of his Lord. Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): “Is he
    who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge
    and faith) and set for him a Light (belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who
    is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come
    out?…” [al-An’aam 6:122]. So come to true life, and follow the Light
    which Allaah has revealed, and you will find that which will delight you and bring you
    peace of mind, when you worship Allaah.
As regards the issue of drugs, no doubt you would expect this great
    religion to forbid everything that is harmful and to permit everything that is beneficial,
    and not to allow man to lose his mind and go crazy, doing all kinds of foolish things

    Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe from the problems of this world and the

How do we explain God to someone who believes that while God exists, they cannot accept or understand how a merciful, compassionate God would allow so much human suffering to take place? The analogy they give is that if we are God's children, why does God not protect us -- just as a parent would guard over their children?","1- It is a Muslim’s belief that suffering of pain, hunger, tragic accidents etc., are due to one's sins, and Allah decrees this suffering to act as a means of erasing these sins which were committed by this Muslim.
2- It is apparent that one, in times of crisis, gets closer to Allah and starts repenting, while in times of ease and comfort he is far from remembering the blessings of Allah and he uses these gifts and blessings in committing sin after sin.","Praise be to Allah.Allah (God) Almighty, is most merciful and compassionate, without any doubt. Yet His actions cannot be fully comprehended by our incompetent minds. 
What simplifies this issue is that we all agree that Allah is fair, just, wise and knowing. That means whatever He-Almighty- does, is with a legitimate purpose although we may not be able to understand, just why.  
For example, a caring and loving doctor and father may be forced to amputate the leg of his only son. There is no doubt that this father loves his son. Yet his action was for the sake of this beloved son, although it may seem cruel to those who do not understand the circumstances. 
Allah Almighty has the greater and higher example, and it is not to any of His creatures to question His doings as it is mentioned in the Quran (interpretations of the meaning): 
“He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will all be questioned.” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:23]
It is a Muslim’s belief that suffering of pain, hunger, tragic accidents etc., are due to one's sins, and Allah decrees this suffering to act as a means of erasing these sins which were committed by this Muslim. Allah says in the Quran (interpretations of the meaning):
“Whatever affliction befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed. And He pardons much.” [Ash-Shu`ara 42:30]
It is also apparent that man in times of crisis gets closer to Allah and starts repenting, while in times of ease and comfort he is far from remembering the blessings of Allah and he uses these gifts and blessings in committing sin after sin.
Allah the Almighty has shown man the path of good and evil, and he gave him the power and will to choose. Therefore, man is accountable to his deeds and the punishment he receives for them, for life in this world is merely a test, but the results are to be known in the Hereafter.

My wife is currently feeding our newborn child. During sex, I drank her milk. Is her milk halal for me?","Drinking one’s wife’s milk has no effect and does not create the relationship of mahram because the breastfeeding which has an effect is that which consists of five feedings or more within the first two years, before weaning.","Praise be to Allah.Rulings related to breastfeeding in Islam
Before answering this question, we must explain some important points about the rulings concerning breastfeeding .
1. Breastfeeding is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and by ijma (scholarly consensus).
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… your foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters…” [al-Nisa 4:23]
Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What is forbidden by suckling or breastfeeding is the same as what is forbidden by nasab (lineage).” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhari, Muslim, 1444)
The scholars agree that the effect of rada’ah (breastfeeding) prohibits marriage and creates the relationship of mahram, and permits seeing and being alone (with the people to whom one is related through rada’ah).
2. For breastfeeding to have the effect of transmitting its benefits from the nursing woman to the child suckled, it must meet certain conditions, which are:
1.     The breastfeeding must happen within the first two years of the child’s life, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling…” [al-Baqarah 2:233]
2.     The number of breastfeedings must total the known five feeds, in which the child eats his fill as if eating and drinking. If the child leaves the breast for a reason, such as to take a breath or to switch from one breast to the other, this (i.e., each separate time the child latches on) is not counted as one breastfeeding. This is the opinion of al-Shafi'i, and the opinion favoured by Ibn al-Qayyim. 
The definition of rada’ah (one breastfeeding) is when the child sucks at the breast and drinks until the milk enters his stomach, then he leaves the breast of his own accord. 
The evidence for the number five (number of breastfeedings) is the report from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “There was in the Quran [an ayah which stipulated that] ten [was the number of] breastfeedings which created the relationship of mahram , then this was abrogated [by another ayah which stipulated] five. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and [the ayah which stipulated five] was still being recited as part of the Quran.” (Reported by Muslim, 1452). 
In other words, the abrogation came so late that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, some people had not yet heard that this ayah had been abrogated, but when they heard that it had been abrogated, they stopped reciting it, and agreed that it should not be recited, although the ruling mentioned in the ayah remained in effect. 
This is an abrogation of the recitation without abrogation of the ruling, which is one type of abrogation.
Having understood this, breastfeeding after the first two years does not create any relationship of mahram. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and among the references which they quote is the verse cited above, along with the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Nothing of breastfeeding creates the relationship of mahram except what fills the stomach to bursting point, before (the age of) weaning.” Reported by al-Tirmidhi. (No. 1152), who said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. 
The application of this according to the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others is that breastfeeding does not create the relationship of mahram except when it is within the first two years, and anything after the first two whole years does not create any such relationship.”
There are some other reports from the Sahabah, such as that narrated from Abu ‘Atiyah al-Wadi'i, who said: “A man came to Ibn Mas’ud and said: ‘My wife was with me and her breasts were full of milk (she was engorged). I began to suck it and spit it out. Then I came to Abu Musa.’ He (Ibn Mas’ud) said, ‘What did you tell him?’ So he (Abu Musa) told him what he had told him. Then Ibn Mas’ud stood up, took the man’s hand (and said), ‘Do you think this is an infant? Breastfeeding is what produces the growth of flesh and blood.’ Abu Musa said: ‘Do not ask me anything when this scholar is among you.’” (Reported by ‘Abd al-Razzaq in al-Musannaf, 7/463, no. 13895).
In al-Muwatta (2/603), Malik reported that Ibn ‘Umar said: “There is no breastfeeding except for the one who is breastfed in infancy; there is no breastfeeding for one who is grown up.” Its isnad is sahih.
Can husband drink milk of wife in Islam?
Malik also reported in al-Muwatta that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Dinar said: “A man came to ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar when I was with him in the court-house, asking him about breastfeeding one who is grown up. ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: ‘A man came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab and said, “I have a slave-girl with whom I used to have sexual relations, and my wife went to her and gave her her milk, then when I went to her, she said, ‘Stop, by Allah I have given her my milk.’” ‘Umar said, “Punish her (your wife), and (continue to) go to your slave-girl, for (the ruling on) breastfeeding only applies to breastfeeding of infants.”’” Its isnad is sahih.
From this it is clear that drinking one’s wife’s milk has no effect and does not create the relationship of mahram. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (9/201): 
“One of the conditions of breastfeeding creating the relationship of mahram is that it should be within the first two years. This is the opinion of most of the scholars. Something like this was narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn Mas’ud, Ibn ‘Abbas, Abu Hurayrah and the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from ‘Aishah. It was also the opinion of al-Shi’bi, Ibn Shubrumah, al-Awza’i, al-Shaafi’i, Ishaq, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad, and Abu Thawr, and was narrated in one report from Malik.
On the basis of the above, drinking one’s wife’s milk has no effect, but it is better to avoid it.
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin was asked about this matter, and he replied: 
“Breastfeeding a grown-up has no effect, because the breastfeeding which has an effect (of creating the relationship of mahram) is that which consists of five feedings or more within the first two years, before weaning. 
On this basis, if it happened that someone breastfed from his wife or drank her milk, he does not become her son.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/338)

Concerning the ayah (interpretation of the meaning), “So set your face steadily and truly to the Faith: (establish) Allah’s handiwork according to the pattern (fitrah) on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the standard Religion: but most among mankind understand not.

(Reported by al-jama'ah)
What is meant by these five things being part of the fitrah is that when they are done, this is in accordance with the natural pattern on which Allah made mankind and urged them to follow, so that they will be better and more perfect. This is the ancient sunnah (way) which was followed by all the prophets and which was enjoined by all the laws they brought. It is a natural and innate way.

There is nothing wrong with killing mice and rats. `Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that Hafsah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“There are five animals for which there is no blame on the one who kills them: crows, kites (hawk-like birds), mice/rats, scorpions and mad dogs.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1828)
(Translators’ note: the Arabic word farah may refer to rats or mice, so both are mentioned in the translation.)
Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said: I heard ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), say: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say:
“There are four things which are fasiq (corrupt) and may be killed at all times, whether one is in a state of ihram [for Hajj and ‘Umrah] or not: kites, crows, mice/rats and mad dogs.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1198)
Are mice and rats harmful?
Mice and rats are harmful creatures, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained:
Ibn 'Abbas said: “A mouse (or rat) came and started dragging the wick (of the lamp). It threw it in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), onto the mat on which he was sitting, and it burnt a hole the size of a dirham. He said, “When you go to sleep, extinguish your lamps, for the Shaytan will tell creatures like this to do something like this so that you will be burned.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 5427)
The mice or rats that may live in people’s houses are among the harmful creatures or vermin (fuwaysiqah) which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to kill in all situations, whether we are in ihram or not. 
The root of the word fuwaysiqah (fasaqah) means to deviate from the right way and to do harm; hence a sinner is described as “fasiq”, and these animals are called fawasiq, as a metaphor for their evil nature; or it was said that it is because it is not haram to kill them, whether one is in ihram or not, for they have no sanctity or protection in any circumstances. Al-Tahawi narrated in Ahkam al-Quran with his isnad from Yazid ibn Abu Nu’aym that he [Yazid] asked Abu Sa’id al-Khudri why mice/rats were called fuwaysiqah. He said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) woke up one night and saw that a mouse/rat had taken the wick of the lamp to burn down the house of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he got up and killed it, and said that it was permissible to kill them whether one is in ihram or not. This was mentioned by al-‘Allamah al-Dumayri.
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated in their Sahihs that Abu Musa al-Ash’ari said: A house in Madinah burned down with its people inside. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard about this, he said:
“This fire is an enemy to you, so when you go to sleep, extinguish it.”
Al-Bukhari narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Cover the vessels, for the mouse/rat may drag out the wick (of the lamp) and burn the occupants of the house.”
Something similar was narrated by Muslim, in which he says: “For the fuwaysiqah may start a fire and burn the house and its occupants.”
Al-Tabari said, explaining these ahadith: if a person wants to spend the night in a house in which there is no one else, and in which there is a fire or a lamp, it is a duty on him to extinguish it before he sleeps… The hadith was narrated by al-Hakim; he said its isnad is sahih.

The one who looks at these games will see that they are based on mental skills and individual reactions or decisions. These games are of various types, with many aspects. Some of them take the form of illusionary battles which train a person in what to do in similar circumstances [in real life]. 
Some other games are based on being alert so as to save oneself from danger; fighting enemies and destroying targets; planning; having adventures; finding the way out of a labyrinth; escaping from wild beasts; racing cars, planes, etc.; overcoming obstacles; searching for treasure. 
Some games increase knowledge and enhance one's interests, such as games that involve taking things apart and putting them back together, jigsaw puzzles, building things, colouring, and shading and lighting.
Are video games haram?
Islam does not forbid leisure or having fun in permissible ways. The basic rule concerning these games is that they are permissible so long as they do not get in the way of obligatory duties such as establishing prayer [i.e., praying properly and on time] and honouring one's parents, and so long as they do not include anything that is haram. 
What are the forbidden elements in games?
There are, however, many haram elements in these games, such as the following:

Games which depict wars between the people of this world (good guys) and people from the sky (bad guys), with all its implications of accusations against Allah, may He be glorified, or the noble angels.
Games which involve sanctifying the cross or passing over or by it to gain strength, to bring one back to life or to give the player extra lives and so on. Also, games which are used for designing birthday cards as in Christian culture are also forbidden.
Games which approve of witchcraft/magic, and which glorify witches/magicians/sorcerers, etc.
Games which are based on hatred of Islam and Muslims, like the game in which a player gets 100 points if he hits Makkah, 50 points if he hits Baghdad, and so on.
Games that glorify the non-Muslims and show pride in belonging to them, like games in which if a player chooses an army belonging to a non-Muslim state he becomes strong, and if he chooses an army belonging to an Arab state he becomes weak. Also, games which teach a child to admire non-Muslim sports clubs and the names of non-Muslim players.
Games that include depictions of nudity, and some games that allow the winner to see a pornographic picture; games that corrupt morals, such as games where the idea is to run away with a girlfriend from the bad guys or a dragon.
Games based on ideas of gambling.
Music and other things that are known to be forbidden in Islam.
Physical harm, such as damage to the eyes and nervous system; harmful effects of game sounds on the ears. Modern studies have shown that these games may be addictive and harmful to the nervous system, as well as causing stress and nervous tension in children.
Making children get used to violence and criminality, and teaching them to take killing and murder lightly, as in the famous Doom game.
Corrupting children’s sense of reality by teaching them about a world of illusions and impossible things, such as coming back from the dead, supernatural powers that do not really exist, images of space aliens, and so on.

We have gone into details about some of the ideological dangers and things that are prohibited by Islam because many fathers and mothers do not pay attention to these things, and they bring these games for their children and let them play with them.
We should also point out that it is not permissible to compete for prizes in playing these electronic games , even if the game itself is permissible, because they are not a means of jihad, and they do not help you develop strength for jihad.

He performed his Farewell Pilgrimage accompanied by thousands upon thousands of people, and he went on more than twenty military campaigns, but there are no reports at all that say he prayed Jumu`ah or ‘Eid prayers when travelling; he just prayed two rak’ahs [i.e., shortened prayers] as on all the other days. 
There are also no reports that say he preached a khutbah on a Friday when he was travelling , neither standing on his own two feet or from atop his camel, as he used to do on ‘Eid, or from a pulpit, as he used to do on Fridays. He occasionally used to deliver an address to the people when he was travelling, and this was narrated by them but no-one reported that he delivered a khutbah to them before prayer on a Friday whilst travelling, and no-one reported that he recited Quran aloud on a Friday (i.e., during Salat al-Zuhr, on a journey). Of course, if he had done something out of the ordinary and recited aloud or delivered a khutbah, they would have reported it. On the Day of `Arafah, he delivered a khutbah, then he came down and led them in a two-rak’ah prayer, but no one reported that he recited aloud in that prayer. That khutbah was not for Jumu`ah because if it had been for Jumu`ah, he would have done the same (delivered a khutbah) on every other Friday (when he was travelling); that khutbah was given because it was part of the rituals (of Hajj). Hence all the Muslim scholars said that he would have given a khutbah at ‘Arafah even if it had not been a Friday. This mutawaatir report proves that it was a khutbah for the Day of `Arafah, not for Friday.”
Can a traveller pray Jumu`ah with the people he is visiting?
From the above we know that Jumu`ah is not obligatory for the traveller, all that he has to do is to pray Zuhr. However, if he prays Jumu`ah with the people of the place he is visiting, this is OK. 
It says in al-Sharh al-Kabir (2/154): 
“Whoever of these people, travellers, slaves and women attends Jumu`ah, does not have to pray Zuhr, and we know of no dispute on this point. Their exemption from having to attend Jumu`ah is to make things easy for them, but if they attend, it is OK, as is the case with the sick person. It is preferable for the traveller to attend Jumu`ah, because this is better, and is on the safe side (because some scholars think that Jumu`ah is obligatory for the traveller who is staying in a particular place, but not for the traveller who is on the road), as he comes under the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the prayer on the Day of Friday (Jumu`ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah, and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you, if you did but know!” [al-Jumu`ah 62:9]
We have already stated that the majority of scholars say that generally speaking it is not obligatory. 
And Allah knows best."

I am unable to conceive children due to sterility are there any specific dua'a  to be said in such a case ?",,"Praise be to Allah.You may pray the duaa of Zakariya (peace be upon him), who said:
Rabbi laa tadharni fardan wa anta khayr ul-waaritheen (O my Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors). This is a beautiful duaa which is very appropriate in this case. Also suitable is another prayer of Zakariya: Rabbi hab li min ladunka dhurriyyatan tayyibatan innaka samee al-duaa (O my Lord! Grant me from You a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation).
The story of Zakariya contains valuable lessons for us. Allaah has told us this story in several places in the Quraan. For example, in Soorat Aal Imraan, where He tells us about Maryam (peace be upon her) He says (interpretation of the meaning):
So her Lord (Allaah) accepted her [Maryam] with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariya. Every time he entered al-mihrab [a praying place or private room] to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said, O Maryam! From where have you got this? She said, This is from Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.
At that time Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: O my Lord! Grant me from You a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.
Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in al-mihrab, (saying): Allaah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, confirming (believing in) the Word from Allaah [i.e., the creation of Eesaa], noble, keeping away from sexual relations with women, a Prophet, from among the righteous.
He said, O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old and my wife is barren? Allaah said: Thus Allaah does what He wills.
He said: O my Lord! Make a sign for me. Allaah said: Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much, and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.[Aal Imraan 3:37-41]
In Soorat Maryam, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
(This is) a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His slave Zakariya.
When he called out to his Lord (Allaah) a call in secret,
Saying, My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!
And verily! I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir, -
Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Yaqoob [inheritance of religious knowledge and Prophethood]. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased!
(Allaah said): O Zakariya! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son. His name will be Yahya. We have given that name to none before (him).
He said, My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme old age?
He said, So (it will be). Your Lord says: It is easy for Me, Certainly, I have created you before, when you had been nothing!
[Zakariya] said: My Lord! Appoint for me a sign. He said, Your sign is that you shall not speak unto mankind for three nights, though having no bodily defect.
Then he came out to his people from al-mihrab [a praying-place or private room] and told them by signs to glorify Allaahs Praises in the morning and in the afternoon.[Maryam 19:2-11]
In Soorat al-Anbiya, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors.
So We answered his call, and We bestowed upon him Yahya, and cured his wife (to bear a child) for him. Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us. [al-Anbiya 21:89-90]
Thinking about the story of Zakariya (peace be upon him) is very beneficial for anyone who is infertile. One may also ponder the story of Ibraaheem and his wife Saarah, whom Allaah rewarded for their patience with Ishaaq when Ibraaheem was very old. He was also given another son, Ismaaeel. Allaah tells us that His khaleel (friend) said (interpretation of the meaning):
All praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has given me in old age Ismaaeel and Ishaaq. Verily! My Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.[Ibraaheem 14:39]
In all situations, the Muslim should accept and be content with the decree of Allaah, even if he is to remain infertile for the rest of his life. It could be that his patience may be better for him than a child. Everything that Allaah decrees has wisdom and a reason behind it, and everything is subject to His Will and Command. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
To Allaah belongs the kingdom of the heaven and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills.
Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things. [al-Shoora 42:49-50]
May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
870,2912,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2912,Who are the Jews and Christians who will enter Paradise?,"Question

                For the time being, I do not have the resources to quote the exact Quranic verse, nor can I tell you what sura it has been taken from. However, I believe it is a  common verse. I understand little Arabic; hence I found that in English. The verse can be interpretted as such:
The godfearing Jews, muslims and christians will not have fear (on that day).
I am not exactly sure of the bracketted phrase.
Now my question to you: is it mistranliteration?
We know that christians and jews in general cannot be hoped to have any
sanction in the life hereafter. So, how do we understand the verse?",,"Praise be to Allah.What you refer to in your question is mentioned in two similar aayaat
    in the Qur’aan. The first of them is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily,
    those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in
    Allaah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their
    Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Baqarah 2:62]
The second is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Surely,
    those who believe, those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians –
    whosoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be
    no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Maa’idah 5:69]
In order to understand these aayaat correctly, we need to refer to the
    scholars of Tafseer (Qur’aanic commentary). The great Imaam Ismaa’eel ibn
    Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the aayah from Soorat
    al-Baqarah:
“Allaah, may He be exalted, points out that whoever of the
    previous nations did well and was obedient, will have a good reward, and this will be the
    case for everyone who follows the Unlettered Prophet [Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the Hour comes – he will have eternal
    happiness, and they will not fear what they are going to face, nor will they grieve for
    what they have left behind. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘No
    doubt! Verily, the awliya’ of Allaah [i.e., those who believe in the Oneness of
    Allaah and fear Allaah much, and love Allaah much], no fear shall come upon them nor shall
    they grieve.’ [Yoonus 10:62]. And Allaah tells us what the angels say to the
    believers at the time of death (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily, those who
    say, “Our Lord is Allaah,” then they istaqaamu [stood straight, i.e.,
    truly followed Islam], on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death)
    (saying): “Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you
    have been promised!”’ [Fussilat 41:30]
As far as the Jews are concerning, their faith meant believing in the
    Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moosa (peace be upon him) until
    ‘Eesa came, after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moosa,
    and did not leave this and follow ‘Eesa, was doomed. As far as the Christians are
    concerned, their faith meant believing in the Injeel (original Gospel) and following the
    laws of ‘Eesa; whoever did this was a believer whose faith was acceptable to Allaah,
    until Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came, after which whoever
    did not follow Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and leave the way
    of ‘Eesa and the Injeel that he had been following before, was doomed. 
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And whoever seeks a
    religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will
    be one of the losers” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] is a statement that Allaah will not
    accept any way or deed from anyone, after sending His Final Messenger, except those that
    are in accordance with the laws of Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him). Prior to this, however, anyone who followed the Prophet of his own time was on the
    Straight Path of salvation. So the Jews were those who followed Moosa (peace be upon him)
    and referred to the Tawraat for judgement at that time. When Allaah sent ‘Eesa (peace
    be upon him), the Children of Israel were obliged to follow him and obey him, and so they
    and others who followed him became Christians.. When Allaah sent Muhammad 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), as the Final Prophet and a Messenger to all the children
    of Adam, all of mankind was obliged to believe in him and obey him, and refrain from what
    he prohibited. Those who did so are the true believers. The ummah (nation) of Muhammad
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are called the believers because of their
    deep eemaan (faith) and conviction, and because they believe in all the past Prophets and
    in the prophesied events that are yet to come.”
Commenting on the aayah in Soorat al-Baqarah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) said: 
“What is meant is that every group believed in Allaah and the Last
    Day, which is the appointed Day of Reckoning, and did righteous deeds. But after Muhammad
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn,
    true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for
    what they leave behind."

IS it proper to hang Quranic verses from the wall to
1. protect one from evil things
2. beautify the room with divine words
3. with the intention that it will gain me rewards
May allah rewad u.",,"Praise be to Allah.The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.
(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).
Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?
His Eminence replied as follows:
If the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it.

    summed up in the following points:
Definition of hiraabah

Ruling on hiraabah

Punishment for hiraabah

The reasons for the different types of these punishments

Repentance of the muhaarib (person who commits hiraabah)

Definition of hiraabah

Hiraabah means ambushing people and threatening them with weapons and
      so on, in the deserts or in the cities, killing them, terrorizing them and seizing their
      property by force and openly.
Wealth is mentioned specifically because this is what usually happens,
      but the ruling applies also to people who terrorize others for the purposes of rape or
      sodomy.
Ruling on hiraabah
Hiraabah is one of the most serious of major sins, and it is forbidden
    according to the Quraan, the Sunnah and ijmaa (scholarly consensus).
Quraan: The Quraan says (interpretation of the meaning): The
        recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the
        land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on
        the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and
        a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and
        then) come back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that
        case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Maaidah 5:33]

Sunnah: the hadeeth of al-Arniyeen. Anas (may Allaah be pleased
        with him) reported that some people came from Akl or Areenah and avoided
        Madeenah (i.e., they did not want to stay in Madeenah because they were suffering from a
        fever). The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered them to drink the
        urine and milk of milch-camels (for treatment of their fever). They did that, and when
        they got better, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
        be upon him) and stole the sheep. This news reached (the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
        Allaah be upon him) at the beginning of the day, and he sent people in pursuit of them. At
        mid-day, they were brought to him and he commanded that their hands and feet should be cut
        off and their eyes put out, then they were left in al-Harrah begging for water, but no one
        gave them water. (Agreed upon).

Ijmaa: the ummah is agreed that hiraabah is haraam.

Punishments for hiraabah

The punishment for hiraabah is one of the hudood or punishments
    prescribed by shareeah, and the punishment varies according to the severity of the
    crime. This is explained as follows:
Whoever kills someone and steals their property, should definitely be
        killed and crucified, so that everyone will know about him. It is not permitted to forgive
        him, by the consensus of the scholars, as was reported by Ibn al-Mundhir.

Whoever kills but does not steal, should definitely be killed, but not
        crucified.

Whoever steals property but does not kill, his right hand and left foot
        should be cut off at the same time, then the bleeding should be stopped and he should be
        released.

Whoever merely terrorizes people, but does not kill or steal, should be
        banished from the land to another country, where he should be detained until he has
        repented sincerely and is reformed.

The evidence for the above is as follows:
The words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): The
        recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the
        land [al-Maaidah 5:33].

The report narrated from Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with
        them both), who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
        upon him) made a peace treaty with Abu Barzah Hilaal ibn Awaymir al-Aslami. Some
        people came, wanting to embrace Islam, and they were ambushed by the companions of Abu
        Barzah. Then Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
        blessings of Allaah be upon him) the revelation of the punishment for killing and stealing
        property, which is to be killed and crucified, and the punishment for killing without
        stealing, which is to be killed Whoever steals property but does not kill should
        have his hand and foot from opposite sides cut off. Whoever becomes Muslim, Islam cancels
        out whatever deeds came before it at the time of shirk. (Tafseer
        al-Tabari, 10/260-261).
      
    
    The reason for different levels of punishment

Different punishments for different degrees of hiraabah have been
      prescribed for a very important reason. Hiraabah may take different forms, as is well
      known, it might not involve only killing, or only stealing. It might involve both stealing
      and killing, or it may involve neither, only terrorizing people. These different forms of
      crime dictate different forms of punishment.
The basic principle in shareeah is that the punishment should fit
      the crime, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense for an
      evil is an evil like thereof [al-Shoora 42:40]. If these punishments did
      not vary according to the crime, and there was room for choice, this might result in the
      most severe punishment for one whose crime was the least serious, or the lightest
      punishment for one whose crime was most heinous, which is a travesty of justice. The fact
      that punishments vary according to the seriousness of the crime makes perfect common
      sense.
Repentance of the muhaarib
If the muhaarib repents, it can only be either of the following two
    scenarios:
Either he repents before he is caught

In this case, the punishment for hiraabah no longer applies, and he
      should be treated like one who is not a muhaarib. The punishment of banishment,
      amputation, or execution etc., no longer applies, except in cases where the victim or his
      family have the right to demand retribution. The evidence for this is the words of Allaah
      (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense of those who wage war against
      Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or
      crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the
      land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the
      Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and then) come back (as Muslims) with
      repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is
      Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Maaidah 5:33]
Or he repents after he is caught

In this case the punishment for hiraabah still applies, and indeed the
      ruler is obliged to carry it out, because the exception mentioned in the aayah clearly
      applies only to one who repents before he is caught. It is not too difficult for a person
      who wants to escape the prescribed punishment to feign repentance.
This punishment is part of the Islamic shareeah which Allaah has
    prescribed for every time and place, not just for one particular country or period. The
    Muslims applied this punishment for hiraabah at the time of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and until the present time. The fact that some of the
    Roman and Pharaonic punishments were similar to those prescribed by Islamic law is of no
    particular significance, good or bad. These Islamic punishments cannot be regarded as
    backward or savage or barbaric at all. Any intelligent person who thinks about the
    severity of the crime of hiraabah and the resulting lack of security in the cities and on
    the road, terrorizing of the populace, robbing and killing, will know for sure that this
    ruling is exactly what these criminals deserve. The one who looks at the way the
    punishments for hiraabah fit the crime exactly will see that this is the essence of
    justice. How can it be otherwise when the One Who has prescribed this law is the Almighty,
    the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the Judge, the Just, the All-Aware? He is
    the Best Disposer of Affairs and the Best of Supporters."
873,2943,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2943,"Colours which are encouraged (mustahabb), disliked (makrooh) and forbidden (haraam) in men’s and women’s clothing","Question

Are there any colours which a muslim/muslimah cannot wear eg red garments",,"Praise be to Allah.Before we answer this question we should note an important point, which is that the basic principle regarding colours of clothes for men and women is that all colours are permissible except where there is a shar’i text forbidding a certain colour for men or women. There are shar’i texts which encourage the wearing of certain colours and forbid the wearing of other colours, such as the following:
Black: Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought some clothes, among which was a small black khameesah [garment]. He said, ‘Who do you think we should give this to?’ The people remained silent. Then he said, ‘Bring me Umm Khaalid,’ and she was carried to him. He took the khameesah in his hand and put it on her, and said, ‘May you live long and wear it out.’ There was a green or yellow mark on it, and he said, ‘O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah (good),’ and sanaah is an Abyssinian word.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, wearing a black turban.” (Reported by Muslim). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I made a black burdah (cloak) for the Messenger of Allaah ( ) peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he wore it, but when he sweated in it he detected the smell of wool on it, so he took it off, because he used to like pleasant smells.” (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haakim (4/188) said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Saheehah (5/168, no. 2136): It is as they said. Abu Dawood named a chapter in his Sunan “Bab fi’l-Suwaad (chapter on black clothes)”. The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (11/126) said: The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to wear black and that there is nothing makrooh in doing so).
Black is permissible for both men and women alike. One of the false innovations (bid’ah) connected to this colour is the practice of deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said (Fataawa Islamiyah, 3/313): “Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded in Islam, which is to say ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allaahumma ajirni fi museebati wa’khluf li khayran minhaa (Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allaah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it).’ If a person says this with faith and the hope of reward, Allaah will reward him for that and will replace what he has lost with something better.” He also said: “Allocating certain clothes for mourning is an act of bid’ah (innovation) in our opinion, and because it could indicate that a person is discontent with the decree of Allaah.”
White: Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he was wearing a white garment and was asleep. I came back to him (later), and he had woken up…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, in a chapter he called Baab al-Thiyaab al-Beed (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported that Sa’d said: “I saw on the left of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing white clothes on the day of Uhud. I never saw them before or since.” These two men were Jibreel and Mikaa’eel, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in al-Fath (10/295). White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Wear your white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p. 82)). White is also the preferred colour for men’s ihraam (special garments for Hajj), which consists of an izaar (lower garment) and a rida’ (upper garment).
Green: Abu Ramthah said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing two green garments.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said, this is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth, and by al-Nisaa’i, 5224).
Red: It was reported that wearing pure red is forbidden for men, but not for women, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mafdam” (reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 3591). Mafdam is something that is filled with red safflower dye. According to the commentary of al-Sindi on Sunan al-Nisaa’i, mafdam is something that is filled with red. It was reported that if ‘Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, “Leave this for the women.” (Reported by al-Tabari).
‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “A man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not respond.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure).
There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden to wear red, including the following:


because it is the dress of the kuffaar


because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is a way of discouraging the imitation of women


because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear it


The prohibition applies only to garments that are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the red hullah should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni hullah usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red.
Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The clothing (of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): Abu’l-Waleed told us Shu’bah told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) saying: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.’ The hullah consists of an izaar and a rida’ (lower and upper garments)… It is a mistake to think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour. The red hullah is two Yemeni garments woven with red and black stripes like all the other Yemeni garments… But pure red is emphatically forbidden. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade red saddlecloths (or blankets) … With regard to red garments in general and red broadcloth, etc., the issue is still under discussion, but it is very disliked (makrooh).” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/139). And Allaah knows best."

                I am a Muslim immigrant in North America. 18 years ago I was newly married and had to go out of town for business. My wife told me that during my absence someone got into the house and just kissed her, but then left, telling her that she is too young. But now after 18 years of our marriage she is telling me that yes she was raped by him. The man had sexual intercourse with her several times that day. During the last intercourse she could not hold back and had orgasm several times from him and hugged and kissed him 
Since the man was a rapist he never came back afraid of getting caught. I feel devastated from this incidence and very upset that why she did not tell me 18 years ago. I was kept in the dark for so many years, under the impression that no one has ever touched her. Please reply me ASAP what should I do? Is our marriage still valid? Should I divorce her? I also don't feel like going to the mosque and pray to Allah anymore. Please email me your reply ASAP to XXXX. Another point is that from the start when the man got into the house, she did whatever the man told her to do, she did not resist or scare him, or made him realize that it is a crime he is comitting, etc. She also did not scare him that my brother who used to live with us, is going to come in the house anytime. Her excuse is that she was too scared. I will wait for your advice.",,"Praise be to Allah.If what 
          your wife has recently told you is what really happened, then she has 
          committed a major sin and an act of clear betrayal by giving in to this 
          attacker and not trying to escape or stop him or call for help and so 
          on.  Her claim that she was forced to do it is not acceptable, 
          because she makes no mention of being threatened with a weapon or being 
          tied up, etc.  If this is indeed the case, and she clearly did 
          not try to defend herself, then what should you do and how should you 
          regard her?  
There 
          is no doubt that you should warn her and remind her about Allaah and 
          the Last Day and its horrors, and explain to her the seriousness of 
          overstepping the limits set by Allaah and betraying one’s spouse. You 
          should also remind her of the terrible punishment dictated by sharee’ah 
          for the married person who commits adultery, which is stoning to death.  
          
After 
          warning her in this fashion, if you see that she regrets what she did 
          and is striving to be righteous, there is nothing wrong with staying 
          with her, and your marriage will still be valid.  It seems most 
          likely that this woman is indeed sorry for what she did and has repented, 
          because she is the one who has brought up the subject after it had been 
          forgotten, and she has told you about it. Perhaps this is because of 
          her guilty conscience and sincere desire to seek forgiveness from her 
          husband.  The sin that she committed when she was very young and 
          living in the ignorant environment of America, and where she may have 
          resisted at the beginning of the attack, then softened, is nothing like 
          the sin of a woman who goes out of her way to commit it, and plans to 
          do it deliberately. Our advice is that if this woman is now righteous 
          and truly regrets what she did, then you should forgive her, especially 
          as you may by now have children who will suffer if you divorce her.  
          At the same time, you should continue to teach her, keep an eye on her 
          and not stay away from her for too long.  We ask Allaah to acceptance 
          repentance from us all.
 Finally, 
          I want to address a serious matter that you refer to in the second part 
          of your question, which is the fact that you say you no longer want 
          to go to the mosque or pray or make du’aa’, because of the crisis that 
          you are facing.  This is very strange, for whenever the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) was faced with a serious matter he would turn to prayer 
          and ask Allaah to help him, and he taught us to do likewise. We should 
          not turn away from the houses of Allaah (mosques) or stop praying and 
          making du’aa’. Where else can you turn in times of trouble and who else 
          can you ask for protection in this crisis? Turn back to Allaah, my brother, 
          ask Him to relieve your distress and seek His help with patience and 
          prayer, for Allaah is with those who are patient."

Do I need to re-marry her when she joins me in XXX. Please advise me because my wife is going to arrive very soon.

Thank you.",,"Praise be to Allah.If the marriage contract has been completed according to the conditions of sharee’ah (see Question # 813), then it is valid and will remain valid as stated in its terms, unaffected by the passage of time.

In this case you should advise him to fear Allaah and not to try to issue fatwas without knowledge.

Is it halal for a pregnant woman to perform ‘umrah or hajj? Does it depend on the stage of pregnancy she is at (e.g. 4 months pregnant compared to 8 months pregnant)? There is risk of falling and disease due to the crowds of pilgrims?","There is no reason why a pregnant woman should not perform Hajj. However, if a trustworthy doctor tells a pregnant woman that going for Hajj will pose a risk to her or her baby, she should be prevented from doing Hajj.","Praise be to Allah.Hajj during pregnancy
There is no reason why a pregnant woman should not perform Hajj. A pregnant woman is tahir (pure), she has to pray and fast, and if she is divorced by talaq, her divorce is acceptable according to the Sunnah. 
It is narrated in the Sunnah that Asma bint ‘Umays (may Allah be pleased with her) went out for Hajj with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when she was pregnant and approaching full term, and she gave birth at the miqat. 
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Asma bint ‘Umays – the wife of Abu Bakr – gave birth to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in Shajarah and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told Abu Bakr to tell her to do ghusl and enter ihram. (Narrated by Muslim, 1209)
Shajarah refers to Dhu’l-Hulayfah, i.e., the miqat from which the people of Madinah enter ihram. 
Al-Nawawi said, concerning what we learn from this hadith: 
“This indicates that the ihram of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating is valid and that it is mustahabb for them to do ghusl before entering ihram. There is scholarly consensus that it is obligatory, but our view and that of Malik, Abu Hanifah and the majority of scholars is that it is mustahabb. Al-Hasan and the Zahiri madhhab said that it is obligatory. 
All the actions of Hajj on the part of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating are valid, apart from Tawaf and the two rak’ahs following tawaf, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do what the pilgrims do but do not do tawaf.” (Sharh Muslim, 8/133)
Hajj rituals that a pregnant woman can’t do
If a woman has not yet done the obligatory Hajj, then pregnancy is not an excuse for her not to do Hajj, because she can avoid the places where there is too much crowding and pushing and shoving. If she is unable to stone the Jamarat herself, she can delegate someone to do so on her behalf. If she cannot do tawaf and sa’i, then she can do so in a wheelchair, and so on. 
Many people manage to do Hajj in comfort without any hardship. 
When going to Hajj poses a risk to a pregnant woman, can she go?
If a woman is pregnant and trustworthy doctors tell her that going for Hajj will pose a risk to her or her baby because she is sick or weak or for some other reason, then she should be prevented from doing Hajj that year. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “There should be no harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2340; this is a hasan hadith. For details of its isnad, please see Jami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam by Ibn Rajab, 1/302) 
Some doctors differentiate between early pregnancy, when there may be a risk to the foetus, and late pregnancy when such fears are groundless.

    passenger riding in taxi driven by a man","Question

                As-salamu alaikum.
      Is it halal or not for a Muslim to drive a taxi because a member of the
      opposite sex might be alone in the car with him which would be khulwah?",,"Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: “No man is ever alone with a woman (khulwah) but the Shaytaan is the third one
    with them.” (Reported by Ahmad and by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 2091; Saheeh
    al-Jaami’, 2546). Allaah says in the story of Yoosuf, peace be
    upon him (interpretation of the meaning): “And she, in whose house he was, sought
    to seduce him (to do an evil act), she closed the doors and said, ‘Come on, O
    you’…” [Yoosuf 12:23]
    It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a woman to whom he is not
    related, whether this is in a house, office, clinic, elevator, car or any other place,
    because this may be the cause of him doing something haraam. Shaytaan is keen to tempt
    people and make them fall into haraam deeds. The fuqaha’ are agreed that khulwah or
    being alone with a woman to whom one is not related is forbidden. They said: “No man
    should be alone with a woman who is not his mahram (a close relative to whom marriage is
    forbidden) or his wife, but is a stranger to him, because the Shaytaan will whisper to
    them and tempt them to do something that is not permitted. (Al-Mawsoo’ah
    al-Fiqhiyyah, 19/267) It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a
    non-mahram woman even if he is teaching her Qur’aan, or to lead her in prayer if only
    the two of them are present. The guideline regarding khulwah is that this prohibition
    applies in any situation where their figures are hidden from other people (Fath
    al-Baari, 9/333). A taxi driver is bound to pass through empty streets
    or highways, and the structure of the car conceals most of the body of a person riding in
    it. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a forbidden conversation will not take place,
    or that there will not be an agreement to do something forbidden. How many tragedies and
    painful stories and disasters have occurred because of a driver being alone with a female
    passenger! The wise sharee’ah of Islam has taken all precautions to avoid anything
    that may lead to wrongdoing. It is essential to completely avoid any situation where a man
    and woman who are not related may be alone together. A taxi driver should not accept a
    female passenger who is alone, except in cases of emergency such as accidents and the
    like. And Allaah is the Source of strength."

                They told us that the sacred rock from
      which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) started his ascent into
      heaven on the night of the Mi’raaj is suspended in the air by the power of Allaah.
      Please tell us if this is correct, may Allaah reward you.",,"Praise be to Allah.Everything is standing in its position by the permission of Allaah,
    whether it be the heavens and all that is in them or the earth and all that is on it
    – even the rock which you asked about. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Verily, Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move
    away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one
    that could grasp them after Him…” [Faatir 35:41]
“And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His
    Command…” [al-Room 30:25]
The Rock in Bayt al-Maqdis is not suspended in space with air around it
    on all sides; it is attached to the side of the mountain of which it is a part and by
    which it is supported; both it and the mountain stand in their positions because of the
    well-known physical laws governing the universe; in this regard it is like everything else
    that exists. We do not deny that Allaah is Able to hold part of His creation in space; all
    of creation is standing in space by the power of Allaah, as stated above. Allaah raised
    the mountain above the people of Moosa when they refused to follow the laws that Moosa
    brought them. It was held up by the power of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning):
“And (remember) when We took your Covenant and We raised above
    you the Mount (saying): ‘Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that
    which is therein so that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:63]
“And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had
    been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said): ‘Hold
    firmly to what We have given you, and remember that which is therein, so that you may fear
    Allaah and obey Him.” [al-A’raaf 7:171]
But our point here is to explain what is in fact the case: the rock in
    Jerusalem is not suspended in space, completely separate from the mountain; it is attached
    to it and is supported by it. And Allaah knows best."

    do they have no soul?","Question

                If the soul is breathed into the embryo
      after four months, are we to understand that the sperm which joins with the woman’s
      egg, from which the embryo is formed, has no soul, or what?",,"Praise be to Allah.Both the sperm and the ovum are alive in a sense which, if they are
    free from defects, prepares each of them to join with the other, if Allaah wills and
    decrees it to happen. When that happens, if Allaah wills it, the embryo is formed and is
    also alive in a manner that suits it and prepares it to grow and develop, moving through
    the known stages. When the soul is breathed into it, it becomes alive in another sense, by
    the permission of Allaah, the Subtle One, the Aware. No matter how a man tries, even if he
    is a highly-skilled doctor, he can never comprehend all the secrets and stages of
    development of pregnancy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the
    wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due)
    proportion. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Great, the Most High.”
    [al-Ra’d 13:8-9]
“Verily, Allaah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He
    sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs…” [Luqmaan 31:34]
(Fataawa Islamiyyah li’l-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 488).
Life is of varying kinds, and each being is alive in a
    manner that suits it by the power of Allaah. So plants are alive in a manner that suits
    them, sperm is alive in a manner that suits it, and man is alive in a manner that suits
    him, and so on. Allaah is the Creator of all this, and He has made water the basis of
    every living thing, as He says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the
    earth were joined together as one united piece, then We parted them? And We have made from
    water every living thing. Will they not then believe?” [al-Anbiya’ 21:30]

889,3004,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3004,Opening      a store to sell reptiles and predatory animals,"Question

I want to ask a question about the Islamic ruling on dealing in and buying animals for hobby purposes or for decorative purposes. These include the following, which is not a comprehensive list Decorative birds such as parrots and other colourful birds Reptiles such as snakes and lizards Predators such as wolves, lions, foxes, etc. -- where these animals are kept for their beautiful appearance or used for their fur. It is known that they are expensive and will be kept behind bars, but dealing in them is very profitable.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: selling decorative birds like parrots, colourful birds and nightingales for their voices is permissible, because looking at them and listening to them is something that is permissible. There is no text in the sharee’ah which forbids selling them or collecting them; however there are texts which may be understood as meaning that it is permissible to keep them in cages, so long as they are fed and watered and given whatever care is needed. Among these texts is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Anas, who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the best of people in attitude. I had a brother called Abu ‘Umayr, who had just been weaned, I think. When (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came, he would say, ‘O Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to the nughayr?’ – a nughar [young sparrow or small bird] with which he used to play.” This nughar is a type of bird. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in his commentary (Fath al-Baari), when enumerating the things that we learn from this hadeeth: “… it is permissible for children to play with birds; it is permissible for parents to allow their children to play with things with which it is permissible to play; it is permissible to spend money on permissible things to entertain children; it is permissible to keep a bird in a cage or to clip a birds’ wings – for one or the other must have been the case with Abu ‘Umayr’s bird, and whichever one it was, the other is also implied in the ruling.
There is also the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she detained but she did not give it food or water, and she did not let it free so that it could eat of the vermin of the earth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Saheeh, 4/100,152; Ahmad, 2/261). If this is permissible in the case of cats, then it is also permissible in the case of birds etc.
Some scholars believed it to be makrooh to keep them in cages. Some believed that it was not allowed, and said: because people do not need to listen to their voices and look at them. This is an unnecessary luxury and soft living, and it is also foolishness because it means that one is enjoying the voice of a creature that is calling out in longing to be allowed to fly and grieving that it cannot fly freely in the open air – as was stated in the book Al-Furoo’ wa Tasheehuh by al-Mirdaawi, 4/9, and al-Insaaf, 4/275.
Secondly: among the conditions of valid sales is that the thing to be sold is something which it is permissible to use and benefit from, even if there is no necessity as such. There is no benefit in snakes, which are indeed harmful, so it is not permissible to buy or sell them. The same applies to lizards – there is no benefit in them, so it is not permissible to sell or buy them.
Thirdly: it is not permissible to sell predators such as wolves, lions, foxes or any other fanged carnivore, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that, and because it is a waste of money, which was also forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)."

Is it permissible to kill insects that may be found in the house, such as ants, cockroaches and the like, by burning them? If it is not permissible, what should we do?","1.	If ants or cockroaches or dung-beetles cause harm, they may be killed with insecticides but not with fire. 
2.	The Prophet told us that rats, scorpions, crows, kites [a hawk-like bird], and mad dogs are harmful pests, and he told us to kill them whether we are in Ihram or not.","Praise be to Allah.If these insects are harmful, they may be killed with insecticides, but not with fire. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are five pests that may be killed whether one is in Ihram or not: rats, scorpions, crows, kites [a hawk-like bird], and mad dogs.” (Reported by Muslim, 2071) Another report adds a sixth, snakes. 
Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that they are harmful pests, and that they are unlike other animals which do not do harm, and so he told us to kill them whether we are in Ihram or not. 
If other creatures, such as ants or cockroaches or dung-beetles, cause harm, they may also be killed with insecticides, but not with fire.

    illegitimate children","Question

                Can an illegitimate person enter
      Paradise if he obeys Allaah? Is there any sin on him or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.An illegitimate child does not bear any sin because of
    his parents’ having committed the sin of zinaa (unlawful sexual intercourse), because
    that was not of his doing. They bear their own sin, because Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meanings): 
    “… He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and
    he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned…” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
“… no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of
    another…” [al-An’aam 6:164]
With regard to his ultimate destiny, the illegitimate person is like
    anyone else: if he obeys Allaah and does righteous deeds, and dies as a Muslim, then
    Paradise will be his; if he disobeys Allaah and dies as a kaafir, then he will be one of
    the people of Hell. If he mixes righteous deeds and bad deeds, and dies as a Muslim, then
    his fate is up to Allaah: if He wills, He will forgive him, if He wills, He will punish
    him, and his eventual admission to Paradise will be by the Grace and Mercy of Allaah. As
    for the hadeeth which says that an illegitimate person will not enter Paradise, this is a
    fabrication (falsely attributed to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him)). And Allaah knows best."

893,3009,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3009,Are Prayer Beads Allowed in Islam?,"Question

What is the ruling on using prayer beads?","Some scholars say that it is permissible to use prayer beads (Masbahah ), but they say that it is preferable to do Tasbih (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is Bid`ah (reprehensible religious innovation).","Praise be to Allah.Some scholars say that it is permissible to use the Masbahah (prayer beads), but they say that it is preferable to do Tasbih (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is Bid`ah (reprehensible religious innovation).
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fatawa (22/187): 
“Some of them might show off by putting their prayer-mats over their shoulders and carrying their Masbahah in their hands, making them symbols of religion and prayer. It is known from the Mutawatir reports (reports in such large numbers that they couldn’t be forged) that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor his Companions used these as symbols. They used to recite Tasbih and count on their fingers, as the Hadith says: “Count on your fingers, for they will be asked, and will be made to speak.” Some of them may count their Tasbih with pebbles or date stones. Some people say that doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is disliked, and some allow it, but no one says that Tasbih with the Masbahah is better than Tasbih with the fingers.” Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) goes on to discuss the issue of showing off with the Masbahah, saying that it is showing off with regard to something that is not prescribed by Islam, which is worse than showing off with regard to something that is prescribed.”
Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked  (al-Al-Liqa al-Al-MaftoohMaftuh, 3/30) whether using the Masbahah for Tasbih is Bid`ah, and his reply was: 
“It is better not to do Tasbih with the Masbahah, but it is not Bid`ah , because there is a basis for it, which is the fact that some of the Sahabah (Companions) did Tasbih with pebbles. But the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that Tasbih with the fingers is better, as he said, `Count with the fingertips, for they will be made to speak.’ Doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is not haram (impermissible) or Bid`ah, but it is better not to do it, because the one who does Tasbih with the Masbahah has shunned something better. Using the Masbahah may also be contaminated with some element of showing off, because we see some people carrying Masbahah that contain a thousand beads, as if they are telling people, `Look at me, I do a thousand Tasbihs!’ Secondly, those who use the Masbahah for Tasbih are usually absent-minded and not focused, so you see them doing Tasbih with the beads, but their gaze is wandering all over the place, which indicates that they are not really concentrating. It is better to do Tasbih with one’s fingers, preferably using the right hand rather than the left, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count his Tasbih on his right hand. If a person counts his Tasbih using both hands, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to use the right hand only.”
Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1/110), where he quotes the (inauthentic) Hadith “What a good reminder is the Subhah [Masbahah],”
“In my view, the meaning of this Hadith is invalid for a number of reasons:

Firstly, the Subhah [Masbahah] is Bid`ah and was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It happened after that, so how could he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have encouraged his Sahabah to do something that was unknown to them? The evidence for what I have said is the report narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid’ wa’l-Nahy `anha from Al-Salt ibn Bahram, who said: `Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a [Masbahah] with which she was making Tasbih, and he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making Tasbih with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, “You think you are better than the Sahabah, but you are following unjustified Bid`ah! You think you have more knowledge than the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!”’ Its chain of narrators is authentic to As-Salt, who is one of the trustworthy followers of the Tabi`in.
Secondly, it goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). `Abdulah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, `I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the Tasbih on his right hand.’”

He also said (1/117): 
“If there is only one bad thing about the Masbahah, which is that it takes the place of the Sunnah of counting on the fingers, even though all agree that counting on the fingers is preferable, then that is bad enough. How rarely I see people counting their Tasbih on their fingers!
Moreover, people have invented so many sophisticated ways of following this Bid`ah, so you see the followers of one of the [Sufi] Tariqahs (orders) wearing the Masbahah around their necks ! Or some of them counting with the beads whilst talking or listening to you! Or another one – the like of whom I have not seen for some time – riding his bicycle through a street crowded with people, with the Masbahah in one of his hands! They are showing the people that they are not distracted from the remembrance of Allah for even an instant, but in many cases this Bid`ah is a cause of their neglecting what is obligatory. It has happened many times – to others as well as myself – that when I greet one of these people with Salam, they answer only by waving and not by saying the words of the greeting. The bad results of this Bid`ah are innumerable, and no one can say it better than the poet:
`All goodness is in following that which went before (the Salaf)
All badness is in the innovations of those who came later.’”

In Question number 164 on the ruling of selling wine to non-muslims Sheikh has quoted to be said:  ""Verily when Allah forbids something, He forbids its price."" I have a service which anyone can subscribe by sending email to:  XXXX  in the body of the message subscribe ahad This service sends one hadith a day, english translation, from Sahih Al-Bukhari.  Here's what they have sent me:  Bukhari Vol 8; no. 11 Narrated by Ibn Umar (Radhiallaho Anho):  My father, seeing a silken cloak being sold, said, ""O Allah's Apostle! Buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you.""  He said, ""This is worn only by that person who will have no share in the Hereafter.""  Later a few silken cloaks were given to the Prophet (Sallahllaahu 'alaihi wasallam) as a gift, and he sent one of those cloaks to Umar.  Umar said (to the Prophet), ""How can I wear it while you have said about it what you said?""  The Prophet (Sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) said, ""I did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear.""  So Umar sent it to his (pagan) brother who was from the inhabitants of Mecca before he (Umar's brohter) embraced Islam. From the hadith quoted above it seems like it is permissible to sell it or to give it to non-Muslims.",,"Praise be to Allah. We constantly advise people, when reading texts that appear to present a problem, to examine all versions and isnaads of these ahaadeeth, and to refer to the words of scholars and commentators, because they have the knowledge and understanding that can dispel the confusion.  In the following discussion we will quote several versions of the hadeeth as reported by al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him), then we will give a summary from the commentary on the hadeeth by al-Haafiz Ahmad ibn ‘Ali ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani (may Allah have mercy on him) from his book Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, and from the commentary of Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) on the same hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim.  
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar reported that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab saw a hullah siyara’ [a type of two-piece garment] at the door of the mosque and said, “O Messenger of Allah, why don’t you buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the delegations come to you?”  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This is only worn by one who has no share in the Hereafter.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought a number of garments [hullahs] of the same type. He gave one of them to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) and ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allah, are you giving it to me to wear it when you said what you said about the hullah of ‘Utaarid (the vendor of the first hullah)?”  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am not giving it to you to wear it.”  So ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) gave it to a brother of his in Makkah who was a mushrik.”  (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 837). 
According to another report: “[The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:] Sell it and benefit from its price.” Al-Bukhaari, 896.
 According to another report: “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for it is worn only by one who has no share in the Hereafter. I sent it to you so that you could benefit from it – i.e., by selling it.”  Al-Bukhaari, 1962. 
According to another report: “Umar said: ‘How can I wear it when you said what you said about it?’   He said, ‘I did not give it to you for you to wear it; sell it or give it to someone else.’  So ‘Umar sent it to a brother of his among the people of Makkah, before he [the brother] became Muslim.”  Al-Bukhaari, 2426.
 According to another report: “He said: ‘Sell it and spend the money on your own needs.’”  Al-Bukhaari, 2826. 
According to another report: “He said: ‘I sent it to you so that you could make some money from it.’”  Al-Bukhaari, 5617.
 Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Concerning the phrase, ‘Why don’t you buy it and wear it?’ – it is as if ‘Umar wanted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to buy it and wished that he would do so. ‘This is only worn’ – according to the report of Jareer ibn Haazim, he said, ‘silk is only worn’.  ‘One who has no share’ – Maalik added in his report, ‘in the Hereafter.’  This could mean the one who has no share in the Hereafter, i.e., of silk clothes. 
‘He gave it to him’ – it is apparent from the rest of the hadeeth that he did not give it to him to wear, or it could mean that he gave him something that could be used for clothing. [The verb used, kasaa, has the sense of covering or clothing].  According to the report of Maalik, ‘Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought a number of similar hullahs, and he gave one to ‘Umar.’ In another report, ‘Later on some hullahs (of the same type) were brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he sent one to ‘Umar and one to Usaamah ibn Zayd, and gave one to ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib.’
 ‘Sell it and spend the money on your own needs’ – means benefit from its price, or it could mean trade it or exchange it, or some more general meaning. 
(Note): the reason why this hadeeth was included in Baab al-Hareer li’l-nisa’ (Chapter on silk for women) is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar, ‘sell it or use it for clothing.’ Silk is forbidden for men, and there is no difference between ‘Umar and other men in that regard, so the permission to give it to someone else to wear applies only if it is given to a woman.  The fact that ‘Umar gave it to his brother should not be a source of confusion to those who believe that the minor issues of sharee’ah apply to kaafirs too, as ‘Umar gave it to his brother to sell it or to give it to a woman to wear.
 In some versions of the hadeeth… Ibn ‘Umar said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw ‘Utaarid wearing a silk garment and he disliked that for him, then he gave ‘Umar a similar garment…’  and ‘… [he said,] “I did not give it to you to wear it, I gave it to you to give to women to wear.”’  This is an indication that it is permissible for women to wear pure silk.  
Imaam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one day wore a coat of silk brocade that had been given to him, but soon afterwards he took it off and sent it to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab.  It was said to him, “But you took it off so quickly, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Jibreel forbade me to wear it.”  Then ‘Umar came to him, weeping, and said, “O Messenger of Allah, you disliked something and gave it to me. What is wrong with me?”  He said, “I did not give it to you to wear it, I gave it to you to sell it.” So he sold it for two thousand dirhams.’  (Reported by Muslim, 3861).” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim:
 “In the hadeeth of ‘Umar about this hullah there is evidence that silk is forbidden for men and permitted for women, that it is permissible to give it, that its price is permitted, and that a Muslim is permitted to give a kaafir clothes and other things.
 ‘So ‘Umar gave it to a mushrik brother of his in Makkah’ – this is how it was reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari in some chapter, ‘‘Umar sent it to a brother of his among the people of Makkah, before he [the brother] became Muslim’ – this indicates that he (the brother) subsequently became Muslim… This also indicates that it is permissible to maintain family ties with kaafirs and to treat them well, and that it is permissible to give gifts to kaafirs.  The permission to give silk clothes to men does not mean that they should wear them. Some may misinterpret this to mean that kaafir men are permitted to wear silk, but this is incorrect. The hadeeth describes giving a gift to a kaafir, but does not give them permission to wear silk.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent silk garments to ‘Umar, ‘Ali and Usaamah (may Allah be pleased with them), but this does not mean that they were permitted to wear silk; he stated quite clearly that he was giving it to them so that they could benefit from it in some way other than by wearing it.  The correct opinion, which is that of the majority of scholars, is that the minor issues of sharee’ah apply equally to kaafirs, so they are forbidden to wear silk just as Muslims are. And Allah knows best.
 Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported another hadeeth on the same issue from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, who said that his father Makhramah said to him: ‘O my son, I have heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has received some coats and he is sharing them out, so let us go to him.’  So we went and found the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his house. [My father] said to me, ‘O my son, call the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for me.’ I felt too embarrassed, so I said, ‘Should I call the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for you?’ He said, ‘O my son, he is not arrogant.’ So I called him, and he came out carrying a coat of silk brocade with gold buttons. He said, ‘O Makhramah, we kept this for you,’ and he gave it to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Libaas, Baab al-Muzarrar bi’l-Dhahab).
 Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadeeth:
 “ ‘He came out carrying a coat of silk brocade with gold buttons’ – it is possible that this happened before silk was prohibited, but after silk and gold were prohibited for men, this report can no longer be used as evidence by those who want to permit these things.  It is also possible that this happened after these things were prohibited, in which case the garment was given so that the recipient could benefit from it either by selling it or by giving it to women to wear.”
 In brief, then, the answer to the matter raised in the question is that so long as a silk garment has some legitimate use, such as clothing for women, then it is permissible to sell it and take the money paid for it.  And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
895,3013,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3013,What Is Zina?,"Question

I need further information about the verse interpreted here about adultery. Adultery, according to the Hudood I read, requires penetration. Is that true of Islamic law?
Are married persons, or single for that case, indulging in immoral acts that do not include penetration (but maybe oral sex), exempted from this punishment?
Secondly, is there forgiveness for adultery? Or for what I inquired in my previous question.
I'd be greatly obliged to receive an answer, because this issue has confused me for a long time.","Zina is one of the forbidden deeds, one of the most serious major sins after shirk and murder. 
All religions are agreed that Zina is haram; no religion allows it. The punishment for Zina is the most severe of punishments, because it violates peoples’ honour and lineages. Learn more in the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.What is Zina? 
Zina, in Arabic, means immorality, and is used with two meanings in Shari`ah: a general meaning and a specific meaning.
The general meaning includes that which carries the punishment (hadd) and that which does not carry it. Islam does not give the name of Zina only to that which carries the punishment, which is just one of many types of Zina. 
Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: I have never heard any better definition of small faults [al-Najm 53:32] than that which Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Allah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of Zina, and there is no way to escape from it. The Zina of the eye is a glance, the Zina of the tongue is speaking, and the Zina of the mind is wishing and hoping; then the private part either acts upon this or it does not. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 11/26; Muslim, 4/2046).
Al-Bukhari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled Bab Zina al-jawarih doon al-farj (Chapter on the Zina of faculties other than the private part).
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Zina is not always associated with the private part itself, but may involve other faculties such as the eyes and so on. Ibn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Looking and speaking are called Zina because they lead to real Zina. This is why he said that the private part either acts upon this or it does not
Zina: A Grave sin in Islam
Zina is one of the forbidden deeds, one of the most serious major sins (kabair) after shirk and murder. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds, for those Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Furqan 25:68-70]
“And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a fahishah [anything that transgresses its limits a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).” [al-Isra 17:32]
Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said that the phrase ‘And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse’ is more eloquent than merely saying Do not commit Zina, because the meaning is, Do not even come close to Zina. This means not doing any deed that may get close to Zina or lead to it, such as being alone with a member of the opposite sex, touching, looking, going to evil places, speaking in a haraam manner to a woman to whom one is not related, thinking about and planning immoral acts, and so on.
Abd-Allah ibn Masood said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Which sin is worst in the sight of Allah? He said, To make any rival to Allah, when He has created you. I asked, Then what? He said, To kill your child for fear that he will eat with you. I asked, Then what? He said, To commit Zina with the wife of your neighbour. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 8/492; Muslim, 1/90).
All religions are agreed that Zina is haram; no religion allows it. The punishment for Zina is the most severe of punishments, because it violates peoples’ honour and lineages.
Degrees of zina
The sin of Zina may be of varying degrees, and the gravity of the offence depends on the nature and circumstances of the deed, although all Zina is haram, a major sin and an act of immorality. Zina with a mahram [i.e., incest] (Allah forbid) or with a married woman is far worse than Zina with a woman to whom one is not related or with an unmarried woman, because it involves violating the rights of the husband, contaminating his bed, attributing a child to him that is not his, and other kinds of offence and harm. 
If her husband is a neighbour, the crime of being a bad neighbour is added to the offence. If her husband is one's brother or relative, the crime of breaking family ties is added. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: He will not enter Paradise whose neighbour is not safe from his evil actions. (Reported by Muslim, 1/68). 
There is no evil action worse than Zina, and if the husband is absent for the sake of Allah, such as in worship, seeking knowledge or jihaad, then the sin is compounded. Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The wives of the mujahideen are as sacred and forbidden to those who stay behind as their own mothers. There is no man of those who stay behind who is entrusted by one of the mujahideen with the care of his family and then betrays him (by committing Zina), but he will be detained on the Day of Resurrection, and (the one whom he betrayed) will take as much of his good deeds as he wishes. So what do you think? (Reported by Muslim, 3515)
Punishment for zina
If the adulterer is married, the sin is greater, and the punishment is stoning, and if he is an old man, the sin is greater and the punishment is as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned in the hadeeth about the three whom Allah will neither look at nor praise on the Day of Resurrection, and who will have a painful punishment. (Saheeh Muslim, 156)
If the deed is also committed during a sacred month or in a sacred place or at a time which is special in the sight of Allah, the sin is compounded.
What constitutes zina?
The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that the basic act of Zina which carries the punishment is illegal sexual intercourse, whereby the two circumcised parts [i.e. genitals] come together and there is penetration of the tip of the penis, because this is actual penetration (which carries the prescribed hadd or punishment).
What leads to zina?
A person must avoid evil deeds and everything that can lead to them. Allah has commanded us to avoid the traps of the Shaytaan, because if a man takes one step in that direction, his shaytan and his own ego (nafs) will keep urging him to do evil until he commits immoral deeds.
One should think about how serious it is to touch a woman to whom one is not related, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with a piece of iron it would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman whom it is not permissible for him to touch. (Reported by al-Tabaraani; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 5045). 
This refers to the punishment for touching, so how about worse deeds, such as embracing and kissing, and even worse kinds of illicit activity? The Muslim judge is empowered to stipulate an appropriate punishment for every proven action other than actual intercourse; in the case of intercourse, the punishment set out by Islam is one hundred lashes and a year’s exile for one who is unmarried, and stoning for one who is married. This is the punishment in this world, and the punishment in the Hereafter is far more severe.
Will adulterers be forgiven?
One of the important principles which the salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) pointed out is that the sincere believer who truly hopes for Allaah and the Hereafter should not look at whether the sin is major or minor, or whether is carries a punishment (hadd) or not. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: There is no major sin if one asks for forgiveness, and there is no minor sin if one persists in repeating it. Someone else said: If you want to disobey Allah, do not think about the smallness of the sin, think about the greatness of the One Whom you are disobeying.
How can you seek repentance from zina?
With regard to the matter of repentance from Zina , please refer to the book ""I Want to Repent, But..."" May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

896,3020,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3020,Is It Prohibited to Eat with the Left Hand?,"Question

Because of my nephew’s bad habit he has great difficulty in eating with his right hand. At the moment, he uses his left hand when there is nobody to remind him. I am worried about this, so, what is the Fiqhi ruling concerning a person who gets used to eating with his left hand?","Prophet Muhammad said: “When any one of you eats, let him eat with his right hand, and when he drinks, let him drink with his right hand, because the devil eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand.” Therefore, the one who uses his left hand to eat and drink should be taught the Islamic ruling and should be reminded of this Hadith.","Praise be to Allah.Doing good is a habit and doing evil is a habit. Man is always either making progress or falling behind. When a person gets used to doing something, he becomes very fond of it and loves it, and dislikes anything else. Then he thinks that the thing he is not used to is not possible, but this way of thinking is not right and it goes against both the laws of Islam and the facts of reality. 
Therefore, the one who uses his left hand to eat and drink should be taught the Islamic ruling and should be reminded of the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on this matter. When a man ate with his left hand in his presence, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Eat with your right hand. He said, I cannot. He said, May you never be able to! Nothing was stopping him but his stubborn arrogance, and he never raised his right hand to his mouth after that. (Narrated by Muslim, 3776).
According to a report narrated by Ad-Darimi, his right hand never reached his mouth. This man suffered paralysis because of the Du`a of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“In this Hadith, we have an indication that it is allowed to pray against a person who breaks a Shar`i rule with no excuse. We also see the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil in all situations, even with regard to eating . It encourages us to teach proper manners of eating to a person who is eating if he is doing something wrong. The Hadith also teaches us that the devil eats with his left hand, because of the Hadith: When any one of you eats, let him eat with his right hand , and when he drinks, let him drink with his right hand, because the devil eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand. (Narrated by Muslim, 3764)
The devil eats with his left hand so the person who eats with his left hand resembles the devil, indeed the devil is sharing his food with him. Ahmad reported with a sound Isnad (chain of narration) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and attributed it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Whoever eats with his left hand, the devil eats with him. (Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, commentary on Hadith 1721)
Moreover, the left hand should be reserved for removing dirt, as when cleaning oneself after going to the toilet (Istinja’) and blowing one's nose and other kinds of cleaning oneself and removing dirt. How can a person use that which is used for removing dirt and impurities for putting food in his mouth?
Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use his right hand for eating, drinking and getting dressed and his left hand for everything else. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 30)
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“This is a fixed rule in Shari`ah. It has to do with honourable things such as putting on ones shirt, trousers and shoes, entering the mosque, using Siwak , applying kohl, combing and styling ones hair, shaving the head, giving Salam at the end of prayer, washing oneself in Ghusl or Wudu, leaving the toilet, eating, drinking, shaking hands , acknowledging the Black Stone, and other things where we are encouraged to use the right hand or start with the right. As for the opposite [things that are not honourable], such as entering the toilet , leaving the mosque, blowing one's nose, washing oneself after using the toilet, taking off one's shirt, trousers and shoes, and so on, then we should start with the left or use the left hand. All of this has to do with honouring the right hand or right side.
Some people may have a real problem that prevents them from using their right hand, such as being paralyzed and so on. In this case they are excused and there is no blame on them. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he has an excuse for not eating and drinking with his right hand, such as sickness or an injury, then this is not disliked.
Most likely the problem of the boy you are asking about has to do with habit, so try to get him used to eating with his right hand and keep on advising him and reminding him to do so. You could seek the help of psychiatrists, because some of them may have some useful ideas. We ask Allah to give you strength, May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

  all the problems, from making the marriage valid, through giving a united direction 
  to the future upbringing of the children, to attaining success and happiness 
  in the Hereafter. Your feelings of unease about taking this step may be due 
  to the difficulty of leaving behind what you are used to and the religion that 
  you have grown up in, or reluctance to go against your family and relatives, 
  or fear of hostility and criticism from others, or concern about losing some 
  worldly advantages. But all these issues will be easily overcome when you seek 
  the help of Allaah and are determined to follow the truth. The wise person is 
  prepared to make sacrifices and put up with difficulties for the sake of following 
  the truth, because the truth is worth pursuing. Any difficulties encountered 
  will become easy because the result is happiness in this world and the next, 
  and Paradise the width of heaven and earth. Moreover, your marriage will help 
  you to live in love and harmony with your husband (if he repents to Allaah for 
  the forbidden relationship and becomes a religious person of good morals) and 
  his Muslim family. There will be no dispute as to which religion the children 
  will be raised in, and they will not feel that there is any conflict in the 
  family, so they will be able to grow up free of the psychological complexes 
  that result from the parents difference of religion. Other people have 
  felt something similar to the feelings that you are experiencing now, as is 
  reflected in the following story, which happened at the time of the Prophet 
  of Islam  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him). Anas reported that the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man, Become Muslim. 
  He said, I feel that I dont want to. He said, Become 
  Muslim, even if you feel that you dont really want to. (Reported 
  by Imaam Ahmad, 11618; Saheeh al-Jaami, 974). This is the correct approach 
  which people should have towards the true religion. For more information on

  the matter of marriage itself. A Muslim man is permitted to marry a chaste woman 
  from the People of the Book (see Question #689

  to her situation at the time of marriage: has she given up her former promiscuous, 
  immoral ways or not? If she is chaste and pure, it is permissible for him to 
  enter into a marriage contract with her, and in this case, the dowry is her 
  undeniable right. In order to resolve the problem once and for all, we advise 
  you to enter Islam, because Islam cancels out all previous sins and wrong deeds,

My father is following the JAMAH TABLIGH; he likes to do Dawah and worshiping but has no responsibility in the family. Is it true during the prophet lifetime that Sahaba went out to Dawah and left the family behind for ALLAH to take care?
I'm very sorry if my question is being offensive to individual or JAMAH TABLIGH.",,"Praise be to Allah.No doubt the cause of this problem and others is ignorance of many of the rulings of Islam, and a lack of understanding of a man’s responsibilities towards those whom he is supporting, and the duties towards his family that Allaah has enjoined upon him.
One of the greatest rights enjoined by wives in children is that the head of the family should spend on them; indeed, this is one of the greatest acts of worship and devotion to Allaah that a person can do. Spending on them covers their food, drink, clothing and shelter, and everything that a wife and children need to ensure their good health and physical well being.
Allaah has told us that men are the ones who spend on women, and so they have the status of being qawwaamoon (maintainers and protectors) and of excelling over them, because they spend on them when they give them the mahr (dowry) and maintenance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means…”[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
The fact that this spending is obligatory is indicated by the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars and of all wise people.
The evidence of the Qur’aan includes the aayat (interpretation of the meanings):
“Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given him. Allaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allaah will grant after hardship, ease.”[al-Talaaq 65:7]
“… but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear…”[al-Baqarah 2:233]
“… and if they are pregnant, spend on them until they deliver…”
[al-Talaaq 65:6]
With regard to the evidence in the Sunnah, many ahaadeeth were narrated which show that it is obligatory for the husband to spend on his wife and children, and those who are under his guardianship. Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his sermon during his Farewell Pilgrimage:
“Fear Allaah with regard to women, for they are your prisoners. You have taken them as a trust from Allaah, and they are permissible for you through the word of Allaah, and they have the right to be given provision and clothing by you on a reasonable basis.” (Reported by Muslim, 8/183).
‘Umar ibn al-Ahwas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say during his Farewell Pilgrimage:
“Verily, you have rights over your women, and your women have rights over you. As for your rights over your women, they are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, or allow anyone into your houses whom you dislike. Verily, their rights over you are that you should treat them well with regard to their clothing and food.”
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1163, and Ibn Maajah, 1851).
Mu’aawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
“I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over us?’ He said, ‘That you feed her when you feed yourself and clothe her when you clothe yourself, that you do not say to her, “May Allaah make your face ugly!”, and that you do not hit her.’”
(Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446).
Imaam al-Baghawi said: “Al-Khattaabi said: this is a command to spend on women and clothe them, according to the capabilities of the husband. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made this a right of women, it is necessary whether the husband is present or absent. If the husband is not able to do it, it become a debt which he owes, as with all other duties, whether or not the qaadi (judge) issues a decree to that effect.”
It was reported that Wahb said:
“A freed slave of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said to him, ‘I want to go and spend this month there in Jerusalem.’ He said, ‘Have you left enough for your family to live on during this month?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then go back to your family and leave them what they need, for I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying: “It is enough sin for a man not to give food to the one whom he is supposed to feed.”’”
(Reported by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 1692).
The original report in is Muslim, where the wording is, “It is enough sin for a man to withhold food from the one whom he is supposed to feed.”
Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will ask everyone who has been given responsibility about whatever he was responsible for, until He asks a man about his family.” (Reported by Ibn Hibaan).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
“I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying, ‘By Allaah, if one of you were to get up in the morning and carry firewood on his back, and sell it and meet his own needs from the money and give some away in charity, this would be better for him than coming to a man and begging from him, and either being given something or not. The upper hand (the one which gives) is better than the lower hand (the one that takes), and start with those for whom you are responsible.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/96). According to a report narrated by Ahmad
(2/524), it was said: “For whom am I responsible, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Your wife is one of those for whom you are responsible.”
According to a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If Allaah gives something good to any one of you, let him start with himself and his family.”
(Reported by Muslim, 1454).
With regard to the consensus of the scholars:
Imaam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/564):
“The scholars are agreed that it is the duty of husbands to spend on their wives if they (the husbands) have reached the age of puberty, except in the case of a wife who is rebellious. This was mentioned by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.”
The above references to the texts of Islam indicate that it is obligatory for a man to spend on his family and to take care of their interests. Many hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) demonstrate the virtue of this action and show that it is a righteous action in the sight of Allaah. Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the Muslim spends on his family with the hope of earning reward, this is an act of charity for him.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/136).
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fath (9/498): “Spending on one's family is obligatory according to scholarly consensus. Islam called it sadaqah (charity) lest people think that they are doing it as a duty for which there is no reward, because they knew how much reward there is in giving charity, so that they will not give charity to others until they have given enough to their families. This was to encourage them to give priority to the charity that is obligatory before they give voluntary charity.”
Sa’d ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Whatever you spend on your family, you will be rewarded for it, even the mouthful which you lift up and place in your wife’s mouth.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3/164, and Muslim, 1628).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A dinar that you spend in the way of Allaah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give to the poor, and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of these is the one that you spend on your family. “ (reported by Muslim, 2/692).
Ka’b ibn ‘Ujarah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his Companions were impressed by the man's strength and energy. They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, if only this was for the sake of Allaah!’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If he goes out to work for the sake of his young children, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; if he goes out to work for the sake of his aged parents, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; if he goes out to work to keep himself from having to beg, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; but if he goes out to work for the purposes of showing off and boasting, then he is striving in the way of the Shaytaan.”
(Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2/8).
The salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, understood this duty properly. It was their guideline in their day-to-day life with their families. No one put it better than Imaam al-Rabaani ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said: “There is nothing better than earning one's own living, not even jihaad for the sake of Allaah.” (al-Siyar, 8/399)
It is not permissible for a Muslim to neglect his family even if he claims that he is travelling for the purpose of worship and righteous deeds, because neglecting one’s family and failing to spend on them is haraam. We have quoted above the advice given by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr to the one who wanted to stay in Jerusalem: he had to make arrangements for his family’s provision first. So you have to advise your father of the things we have said in this reply, and explain the matter to him politely and kindly. If you can fill the gap left by your father’s negligence by spending some of your own money on your family as much as you can, you will get a great reward, in sha Allaah. We ask Allaah to put all our affairs right. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

    mother","Question

                AssalmualaykumFor the past 23 years, i endured a lot of physical and mental abuse
      from my beloved mother. In all this time, 
      i have tried very hard to swallow my pain and tolerate it , purely because she is my
      mother, regardless. But, sadly, now, at the age of 23 I am finding it very difficult to
      Tolerate it anymore. Her constant physical and verbal abuse has made me so ill, that i
      have been hospitalised for stress and been recommended to seek professional help. But i
      don't want to see a psychologist who would feed me with information and advice that is
      hostile to the Islamic point of view.
      
      I ma a very pious women,and know how highly regarded mothers are in Islam, and they have
      to be respected regardless. But what about me? Why have i done to deserve all this? Just
      recently, i have learnt, from my father, that she is mentally disturbed, and is a product
      of her hostile upbringing. But that still doesn't help me? 
      As i write to you now, she sits outside in the lounge, and refuses to talk to me and works
      very hard to make my four sisters and brothers not talk to me either. Sadly, they comply,
      so not to make her upset. What really upsets me is that she curses me a lot and makes very
      bad du'oas for me, like wish that i die soon from a horrible disease or go to hell. 
      My real concern is, how much of that would God listen to?  What is God's opinion of
      me? What's His opinion of her?  And what do i do now? Please help and and let me know
      what my rights and obligations are as a Muslim daughter. Can mothers do that just because
      they are mothers and paradise lay under their feet? What about the children? Jazak allah khayra",,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to treat our parents well, and He has linked
    this to the command to worship Him and the prohibition of associating anything in worship
    with Him. The rights of the mother in this regard have been emphasized more than those of
    the father.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Worship none but
    Allaah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents [al-Baqarah 2:83]. Ibn
    Abbaas said: This means treating them with respect and kindness, and lowering
    the wing of humility to them, not answering them harshly or glaring at them, not raising
    one's voice to them, but being as humble towards them as a slave towards his master.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And your Lord has decreed that you
    worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of
    them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, not shout at them,
    but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and
    humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did
    bring me up when I was small. [al-Isra 17:23-24]. Al-Baghawi (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: This means not saying anything that may contain the
    slightest hint of irritation. [The word uff in the aayah, translated
    here as a word of disrepect] comes from the word aff, which
    is similar to the word taff; both words refer to the dirt that collects
    under fingernails, and [in Arabic] when one is annoyed and fed up with something, one says
    uff! to it.
Abu Baddaah al-Tajeebi said: I said to Saeed ibn
    al-Musayyab: I understood everything in the Quraan about respecting ones
    parents, apart from the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) But address them in
    terms of honour [al-Isra 17:23]. What are these terms of honour [al-qawl
    al-kareem]? Ibn al-Musayyab said: It is the way in which a slave who has
    done wrong approaches a harsh and strict master.
The obligation of treating ones parents with kindness and respect
    is not confined only to Muslim parents; they should be honoured in this way even if they
    are kaafirs. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We have enjoined on
    man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship
    upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years  give thanks to Me and
    to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to
    make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them
    not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me
    in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what
    you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:14-15].
If Allaah has told us to treat even these parents with respect and
    kindness, in spite of the heinous sin which they are telling their child to commit, which
    is the crime of associating something in worship with Allaah, then what do you think is
    the case with Muslim parents, especially if they are righteous? By Allaah, their rights
    are among the most important and most certain rights, and fulfilling these rights in a
    proper manner is one of the most difficult and most important duties. The one who is
    guided to do this is truly guided, and the one who is not helped to do this is truly
    deprived. Innumerable ahaadeeth also confirm this. According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him): A man came to the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, who among the
    people is most deserving of my good companionship? He said, Your mother.
    He asked, Then whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then
    whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said,
    Then your father. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/13, and Muslim,
    2548).
    Makhool said: Respecting ones parents is an
    expiation for major sins.
You have to be patient with your mother and put up with the harsh
    treatment on her part, which is upsetting you. By treating her with respect and dealing
    with her kindly, you will earn her good pleasure and love. Try to avoid things that will
    provoke her and make her angry, even if they are in your interests, without causing harm
    to yourself. Your mother, for her part, has to treat you well and stop harming you with
    her blows and insults.
With regard to what you mention about her praying against you, if these
    duaas are said for no good reason, they will not be accepted. It is not
    permissible for her to pray against you for no good reason, because of the general
    applicability of the Prophets words: [The prayers] of any of you will be
    answered, so long as he does not pray for sin or the breaking of family ties. This
    hadeeth indicates that if a duaa includes sin, it will definitely not be
    answered. There is no doubt that praying against ones child for no good reason is a
    sin.
We ask Allaah to help you to treat her with respect and earn her
    pleasure, and to help us all to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allaah
    bless our Prophet Muhammad."
902,3054,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3054,She accuses him of    being stingy and he accuses her of being extravagant,"Question

My wife and I are having bad arguments about money. She makes continual, costly demands of me and my financial situation does not allow for this because of my low wages. I told her and her family about my financial situation before we married. Now we have continuous arguments in which she accuses me of being stingy and I accuse her of being extravagant and demanding more of me than I can do. What should I do about this situation that has brought us to the brink of separation?",,"Praise be to Allah.One of the most important rights that a wife has is that her husband should spend on her, and his spending on her is one of the greatest good deeds that he can do that will bring him closer to Allah. This spending covers food, drink, clothing and housing, and all the other things that a wife needs for her sustenance and good health.
With regard to what you mention of your wifes complaints that you are not spending enough on her, Allah tells us that men are the ones who should spend on women, and they have been given the position of qawwaamah (protector and maintainer) and excellence because of the money they spend on them in the mahr and on their maintenance. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means [al-Nisa 4:34]. The Quran, Sunnah and consensus of the scholars (ijmaa) all indicate that this spending is obligatory.
The Quran tells us (interpretation of the meanings):
the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mothers food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear [al-Baqarah 2:233]
And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they deliver [al-Talaaq 65:6]
With regard to the evidence of the Sunnah, many ahaadith have been narrated which indicate that it is obligatory for a husband to spend on his wife and children and those under his guardianship, as was proven in the hadith of Jaabir ibn Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon: Fear Allah with regard to women, for they are your prisoners. You have taken them as a trust from Allah, and they have become permissible to you by the word of Allah, and they have the right to be fed and clothed reasonably by you.
(Reported by Muslim, 8/183).
Umar ibn al-Ahwas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say during the Farewell Pilgrimage: Take good care of women, for they are your prisoners and you have no rights over them beyond that, except if they commit open illegal lewdness; if they do that, then you should shun them in their beds and strike them, but not in a way that causes pain. And if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, or allow anyone to enter your houses who you dislike, and their rights over you are that you should clothe and feed them properly.
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1163; Ibn Maajah, 1851. Al-Tirmidhi said this is a hasan saheeh hadith).
Muaawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said, O Messenger of Allah, what is the right of the wife of any one of us over us? He said: That you should feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, that you should not say to her May Allah make your face ugly! and that you should not beat her.
(Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446).
Imaam al-Baghawi said: Al-Khattaabi said: This means that it is obligatory to spend on her and clothe her, according to the means of the husband. Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it a right of the wife, it is obligatory on the husband whether he is present or absent. If he is not able to do this at any particular time, it becomes a debt that he owes, as in the case of other duties, whether or not the qaadi (judge) imposes it on him for the time when he is absent.
Wahb said: A freed slave of Abd-Allah ibn Amr said to him: I want to spend this month here in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). He said, Have you left your family anything for their provisions during this month? He said, No. He said, Then go back to your family and leave them something for their provisions, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying, It is enough sin for a man to neglect those he is responsible to feed.
(Reported by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 1692)
The original hadith is reported by Muslim (245), with the wording: It is enough sin for a man to keep food away from those he is responsible to feed.
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Allah will ask every responsible person (literally, shepherd) about those for whom he was responsible, whether he took care of them or not, and He will even ask a man about the members of his household.
(Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 1774).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: By Allah, if one of you were to go out in the morning and gather firewood on his back, and sell it and make himself independent, and give some of it in charity, this is better for him than his coming to a man and asking for anything, whether he gives or refuses. The upper hand is better than the lower hand, and start with those who are under your care.
(Reported by Muslim, 3/96). According to a report narrated by Ahmad (2/524): It was said, Who are those who are under our care, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Your wife is one of those who are under your care.
With regard to the consensus of the scholars (ijmaa):
Imaam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/564): The scholars are agreed that it is obligatory on men to spend on their wives, except in the case of a wife who is rebellious. This was mentioned by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.
The texts referred to above indicate that it is obligatory for a man to spend on his household and to take care of them and their best interests. Numerous ahaadith reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) describe the virtue of this and state that it is a righteous deed in the sight of Allah, for example the hadith of Abu Masood al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If a Muslim spends on his wife, and hopes for reward from Allah, it will be counted as sadaqah (charity) on his part.
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 1/136).
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fath (9/498): Spending on ones wife is obligatory according to consensus (ijmaa), and Islam described it as charity lest people think that it is only a duty for which they will not be rewarded, for they already know the rewards for charity. Islam taught them that it will be counted as charity so that they will not give to others besides their wives until they (the wives) have enough, to encourage them to give obligatory charity before they give voluntary charity.
Sad ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: No matter what you spend on your family, you will be rewarded, even for the morsel of food you put in your wifes mouth.
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 3/164, and Muslim, 1628).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: A dinar spent for the sake of Allah, a dinar spent to free a slave, a dinar given in charity to a poor person, and a dinar spent on ones wife the greatest in reward of all these is the dinar spent on one's wife.
(Reported by Muslim, 2/692)
Kab ibn Ijrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his Companions were impressed with how strong and energetic he appeared. They said, O Messenger of Allah, if only this was for the sake of Allah! The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If he is going out to earn a living for his young children, this is for the sake of Allah; if he is going out to earn a living for his aged parents, this is for the sake of Allah; if he is going out to earn a living so he can keep himself from begging from others, this is for the sake of Allah; but if he is going out to boast and show off, then this is for the sake of Shaytaan.
(Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/8)
The salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) understood this duty properly, and said words to that effect. How marvellous are the words of the great imaam Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allah have mercy on him): There is nothing equivalent in reward to earning money to spend on your family, not even jihaad for the sake of Allah. (Al-Siyar, 8/399).
At the same time, your wife should understand that the husbands obligation to spend should be within his means and according to his financial situation, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease. [al-Talaaq 65:7]
She has no right to mistreat her husband by asking him for too much and expecting him to exhaust himself in spending on her; that is bad treatment indeed. Perhaps if you grant her some of her reasonable requests and remind her, gently and tactfully, of the requests that you have fulfilled, you may be able to lessen her anger somewhat and persuade her to stop asking for more. You could also discuss with her, quietly and without resorting to arguing, how important her requests really are and how necessary it is to keep a certain amount for things that are more important, like paying the rent and so on. This may also persuade her to stop asking.
Know that what you lack in financial resources can be compensated for with kind words and promises for when things get better. When Allah mentioned taking care of ones relatives and upholding family ties, He also mentioned what a person can do who does not have money to give to his relatives. He says (interpretation of the meaning): And if you turn away from them (relatives, the poor etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but you have no money at the time they ask for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then speak unto them a kind, soft word (i.e., Allah will give me and I shall give you). [al-Isra 18:28]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his interpretation of this aayah: And if you turn away from them (relatives, the poor etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but you have no money at the time they ask for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope means: if your relatives ask you for something that We have commanded you to give them, and you do not have anything, and you turn away from them because you have nothing to spend on them, then speak unto them a kind, soft word which means, promise them, gently and kindly, that when the provision of Allah comes, we will give it to you, in sha Allah.
Know that a good attitude will make her forget the hardship you are going through. You have to be patient and treat her kindly, whilst repeating your advice. If life becomes too difficult and the situation between you deteriorates to such an extent that you reach a total impasse, if your efforts do not succeed and life becomes unbearable, then Allah has permitted divorce in such cases, and this may indeed be better for both parties, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): But if they separate (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures need, All-Wise. [al-Nisa 4:130]"

In some cases it is wrong to vote, such as when the matter will have no effect on the Muslims, or when the Muslims have no effect on the outcome of the vote. In this case voting or not voting is all the same. The same applies in cases where all the candidates are equally evil or where they all have the same attitude towards Muslims…
It may be the case that the interests of Islam require Muslims to vote so as to ward off the greater evil and to reduce harmful effects, such as where two candidates may be non-Muslims but one of them is less hostile towards Muslims than the other, and Muslims’ votes will have an impact on the outcome of the election. In such cases there is nothing wrong with Muslims casting their votes in favour of the less evil candidate.
In any case, this is the matter of ijtihaad based on the principle of weighing up the pros and cons, what is in the interests of Islam and what is detrimental. With regard to this matter, we have to refer to the people of knowledge who understand this principle. We should put the question to them, explaining in detail the circumstances and laws in the country where the Muslim community is living, the state of the candidates, the importance of the vote, the likely benefits, and so on.
No one should imagine that anyone who says that it is OK to vote is thereby expressing approval or support for kufr. It is done in the interests of the Muslims, not out of love for kufr and its people. The Muslims rejoiced when the Romans defeated the Persians, as did the Muslims in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) when the Negus defeated those who had challenged his authority. This is well known from history. Whoever wants to be on the safe side and abstain from voting is allowed to do so. This response applies only to elections for influential positions. And Allaah knows best."

Salaams. Thank you again for the wonderful work you are doing to help the Muslim Ummah. May Allah (SWT) bestow His blessings on you.
My question is of differentiating between what is Zikhr & waht is Bidha. My daily drive to work take me approx. 2hrs and to make good use of this time I Listen to the Quran (Arabic with English Translation) on the way to work and on the way home, I try to say some duas I learnt from a books that were given to me. These book published in India/Pakistan suggest that I should recite a particular dua for 100 times and another dua for 500 times etc.... All the duas in these books have the number of times I should recite them. I have researched many authentic hadiths and cannot find this reciting by certain amount. As a result am I committing Bidha if I recite these duas by the amounts suggested in these books. If so, is there any authentic books you could recommend where I can learne and recite daily duas for Zikhr purposes.
Jazak Allah Khair.",,"Praise be to Allah.Some saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe duaas that can be recited one hundred times during the day and night, such as that reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa ala kulli shayin Qadeer (There is no god but Allaah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion and His is the Praise, and He is Able to do all things), one hundred times in a day, it will be equivalent (in reward) to freeing ten slaves, and a hundred hasanaat (good deeds) will be recorded for him, and one hundred sayiaat (bad deeds) will be erased from his record; it will be a protection for him from the Shaytaan all that day until evening comes, and nobody can do any better than that except one who does more than that.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3050).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever says Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allaah) one hundred times in a day, his sins will be wiped out even if they are like the foam of the sea.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5936).
With regard to trustworthy and reliable books of duaas and dhikr, this is a topic which has been covered in many books, ancient and modern, whether the books deal with this topic on its own or it is included with other material. Some examples are:

      should be done with samples left over from quality-control testing?","Question

                Various samples of cheeses, juices, nuts, meats, perfumes, dairy products etc. come to our laboratory. In some cases the samples are more than is required for testing. For example, a carton of juice holds 30 boxes, and the tests require only 5 boxes. There are many similar examples. Is it permissible for the lab technicians to take them or give them to some deserving people? Knowing that leaving them until all the lab and customs procedures are completed would mean that they may go off and have to be thrown out, and, moreover, many of the traders never come and ask about the rest of their samples.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
      those who are responsible for requesting samples for quality-control
      testing must ask for the amount that is usually sufficient for testing,
      and not ask for or accept more than what is needed.
Secondly:
      in cases where only some of the amount given is sufficient, whatever is
      left over must be handed back to its owner. His address should be written
      down on the sample, and an appointment should be made to give back
      whatever is left over from the tests. A name of a contact person and an
      address should also be obtained, so that the goods may be returned.
Thirdly:
      in the event that the owner of the goods or his representative does not
      keep the appointment, and there is the fear that the samples may go off,
      then they may be sold and the money raised should be given to Bayt
      al-maal al-Muslimeen (the treasury of the Islamic state). If they
      cannot be sold, they should be given away to the people who are usually
      taken care of by the bayt al-maal."
906,3075,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3075,"Ruling on praying
    in a torn garment","Question

                If one fnds a hole in their prayer garment, and realizes that he/she has
      been praying in such a condition (the 'awra could be seen through the hole) for some time,
      are all of his/her prayers in need of being repeated? If so, and the person does not know
      for how long this occurred, how can they be sure they made up enough prayers?",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, agreed that covering the
    awrah is a condition of the validity of ones prayer. The evidence for this is
    the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): O Children of Adam! Take your
    adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying [al-Araaf 7:31]
The conditions for clothes to cover the awrah properly are as
    follows:
They should not show the shape or contours of the body; if they do so,
        this is no good because it does not cover properly.
They should be clean (taahir). If the clothes are unclean or impure
        (naajis), then it is not correct to pray in them, because it is haraam to have any
        impurity (najaasah) on ones body or clothes when praying. Allaah says
        (interpretation of the meaning): And your garments purify! [al-Muddaththir
        74:4]. It was reported that a baby boy who was not yet eating solid food was brought
        to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he sat the infant in his
        lap. The child urinated in his lap, and he called for water and poured it over the urine.
        The fact that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hastened to wash
        the childs urine from his clothes indicates that it is obligatory to clean
        ones clothes of any impurity that may get on them.
They should be permissible, not haraam, whether they are haraam in and
        of themselves, such as silk garments, or because of the way in which they are made, such
        as garments that come below the ankles, or because of the way in which they were acquired,
        such as garments seized by force or stolen. 
With regard to the matter of the awrah becoming uncovered during
    prayer, al-Shaafa'i, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: It is good enough for both
    men and women to pray with their awrah covered. The mans awrah is what I
    have already described (i.e., from the navel to theknee), and all of a woman is awrah, apart from her
    face and hands. The top of her feet is also awrah. If during prayer any part of the
    area between a mans navel and knees becomes uncovered, or any part of a womans
    hair, whether it is a lot or a little, or any part of her body apart from her face and
    hands and wrist  and no more than that  becomes uncovered, whether they
    realize it or not, then both (man and woman) must repeat the prayer  unless it was
    uncovered by the wind, or it slipped and was immediately replaced without delay (no longer
    than it takes to pick up the garment and place it back immediately.) (Al-Shaafa'i, Kitaab
    al-Umm, Baab Kayfiyyat Libs al-Thiyaab fil-Salaah). 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni:
    Section: if a little bit of the awrah becomes uncovered, this does not
    invalidate the prayer. This is the opinion of Ahmad and Abu Haneefah. Al-Shaafa'i said:
    It invalidates the prayer because it is a ruling that has to do with the
    awrah, and it is the same whether it is a little or a lot, as is the case with
    looking (at the awrah). We have what was reported by Abu Dawood, with his
    isnaad from Ayyoob, from Amr ibn Salamah al-Jarmi, who said: My father went
    with a group from his people to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him), and he taught them how to pray. He said, The one who reads Quraan
    best among you should lead you in prayer. I was the best at reading Quraan, so
    they appointed me. I used to lead them in prayer wearing a small yellow burdah (cloak or
    garment), and when I prostrated, my awrah became uncovered. One of the women said,
    Cover the awrah of your reciter for us! so they bought me an Omani
    shirt, and I never rejoiced over anything  apart from Islam  as much as I
    rejoiced over that. Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Nasaa'i also reported from
    Aasim al-Ahwal, from Amr ibn Salamah, who said: I used to lead them in
    prayer wearing a burdah made of two attached parts in which there was a gap. When I
    prostrated in it, my backside showed. This was common and was not denounced, and we
    have not heard that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his
    Companions denounced it, because if prayer is still valid despite a severe problem where
    there is an excuse, then we should differentiate between whether the problem is severe or
    not where there is no excuse; it is like the case of walking during the prayer. Avoiding
    little matters may be too difficult, so a little is excused, as is the case with blood.
    Once this is clear, the definition of a lot is that which is offensive to look at, and in
    this case there is no differentiation between the private parts and other parts of the
    awrah. A little is that which is not offensive, and the point of reference is that
    which is customary, except that the two private parts are more offensive than anything
    else, so that is considered to be an obstacle to prayer This is a matter in which
    Islam did not define what is offensive, so the point of reference is what is customary, as
    also applies in the case of excessive movement during the prayer
If these holes show what is customarily regarded to be too much of the
    awrah, and it shows it for a while, or it is not possible to cover them because the
    garment is too small, for example, then the prayer is not valid, because covering the
    awrah is one of the conditions of prayer, and if one of the conditions is not met
    without a valid excuse such as inability to meet it, then the prayer is not valid. You
    have to repeat the prayers which you did wearing this garment. If you do not know how many
    they were, you should take what you are certain of. For example, if you think that they
    may have been four or three or five, but definitely not more than five, then what you can
    be certain of in this case is five, and so on. And Allaah knows best."

                I, my younger sister and brother used to
      live with our father after we moved to the US. He had already divorced 3 women including
      my mother. We found out that all he cares about is money. He treated us well as long as we
      gave him money. My younger brother left us because of his rude and greedy behaviour. 
      We found out that he drinks beer and alcohol and does Zinaah. He didn't even care about
      us. He brought women even in our presence. We tried to stop him but he would abuse us
      verbally and even beat us. He even accuses my mother of doing haram things and disowns his
      own son from his fatherhood. He does this just because my  brother refused to give
      him his paycheck. He never persuaded us to perform Salat and fast during Ramadan, and
      neither he did it himself. Instead he asked me to drink beer and I drank beer a couple of
      times. 
      I'm married now Alahumdulillah. I and my husband do our Salat regularly and I fast to
      compensate for the days I didn't fast during Ramadan. I always repent to Allah to forgive
      me for the bad things I did intentionally and unintentionally. My husband has been helping
      me with all this. 
      His behaviour with my younger sister got worst after I moved to another city after getting
      married. He asked her to drink beer with him and his girl friend but she harshly refused.
      She had to lock door to sleep. She didn' t trust him at all. So I asked her to live with
      us as she didn t have any other place to go (My mother lives in another country).
      I' ve questions in this regards. 
      1. My husband says that he will never let him visit us or us visit him until he gives all
      his haram habits and truly repent to ALLAH. Is this right ? 
      2. What should we do to make him give up all his bad habits? 
      3. I know it's not right for my sister to live with us but what is the ruling in this
      situation ?",,"Praise be to Allah.If the situation is as you describe, then what can we

    deeds? Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah; hasbunaa Allaah wa niam al-wakeel;
    innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raajioon (There is no strength and no power except
    with Allaah; sufficient unto us is Allaah and He is the best Disposer of affairs; verily
    we belong to Allaah and unto Him we will return). [These are duaas
    recited by Muslims when faced with calamity  Translator] Does he not
    know that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
     Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire
    (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern (and) severe,
    who disobey not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which
    they are commanded.[al-Tahreem 66:6]
Does he not know that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) said:
There is no person to whom Allaah has given responsibility and
    dies neglecting that responsibility, but Allaah will deny him Paradise. (Reported
    by Muslim, 203)
    Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of
    you is responsible for his flock (those under his care) a man is the shepherd over
    the members of his household and he is responsible for them
Allaah will ask every shepherd about that for which
    he was responsible. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1627).
    There is no person to whom Allaah has given
    responsibility over others and he failed to take care of them by advising them sincerely,
    but he will never smell the fragrance of Paradise. (Reported by al-Bukhaari,
    6617).
    We ask Allaah to bring this man back to the truth.
Know that even though your father has caused you so much suffering, it
    is not permissible for you to sever your ties with him, in spite of all that you have
    mentioned. You must keep in touch with him and treat him kindly. You and your siblings
    should treat him kindly and express your fears for him and your love for him, because of
    his rights as a father, and because severing ties with him and ignoring him in a hostile
    manner will only make matters worse. Neither you nor your siblings should obey him in sin.
    You mention in your message that your father used to treat you well when you gave him
    money, so if giving him money will put an end to his bad treatment and make things go back
    to normal, so that you will treat one another well and he will see love and sacrifice on
    your part, then why not do that? This is provided that he does not use this money to buy
    haraam things. Try to restrain your anger and forget his past shortcomings in his
    behaviour towards you. Try to honour him and show love towards him. Visit him and look
    after him. Maybe this will stir up true fatherly feelings in him, and maybe stop him from
    doing haraam things. Dont even think of severing ties with him. Get in touch with
    your brother and ask him to get back in touch with his father. Know that your being
    patient with him is a kind of jihaad, which will be rewarded. The idea of not visiting him
    until he repents is not right, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others
    that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world
    kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to
    Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:15]
Visit him, so long as it does not cause you unbearable harm or make you
    do wrongful things. Know that one of the ways to make a sinner repent is having someone
    who will call him to repent and remind him of Allaah. A child has to treat his parents
    honourably even if they are mushrikeen. Al-Qurtubi said:
The aayah indicates that one should honour kaafir parents as much
    as possible by spending on them if they are poor, by speaking kindly to them, and by
    calling them to Islam.
With regard to your sister, she must be careful when she stays with her
    immoral father. Locking herself in is a good safety measure and may well be essential at
    times. If she does not feel safe in the home of this immoral father, she should go and
    live somewhere else where she can be safe, such as in your house, if it is suitable. Maybe
    Allaah will give her a righteous husband who will take care of her and protect her.
We ask Allaah to guide your father and to bring him out of darkness
    into light. May He forgive you for your sin and help your sister and all of us to adhere
    steadfastly to the truth. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

      feature stated that one of the signs of the last days were; that the Quran
      would disappear. I have not heard this. And how could it be true why we
      have many many hafis of Qurans.",,"Praise be to Allah.There are a
      number of ahaadeeth which indicate that the Qur’aan will be taken away
      at the end of time. Among these ahaadeeth are the following:
From
      ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, who said: “Something will come and take the
      Qur’aan one night and not one aayah will be left, either in the Mus-haf
      or in the heart of any person, but it will be taken away.” (Narrated by
      al-Daarimi with a saheeh isnaad, no. 3209)
 Al-Daarimi
      narrated with a different saheeh isnaad (no. 3207) that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn
      Mas’ood said: “Recite the Qur’aan much before it is taken away.”
      They said, “These Mus-hafs will be taken away! What about that which is
      (memorized) in men’s hearts?” He said: “Something will come and take
      it one night, and in the morning they will wake up without it. They will
      forget the phrase ‘laa ilaaha
      ill-Allaah’ and they will start to recite the sayings and
      poetry of the Jaahiliyyah. That is when the Word will be fulfilled against
      them.”
 The
      phrase ‘That is when the Word will be fulfilled against them’ is a
      reference to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We
      shall bring out from the earth a beast for them, to speak to them because
      mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat (Verses of the Qur’aan
      and Prophet Muhammad)” [al-Naml 27:82].
 Ibn
      Katheer said in his tafseer of this aayah:
 This
      beast will emerge at the end of time when mankind becomes so corrupt that
      they neglect the commandments of Allaah and change the true religion.
      Allaah will bring forth for them a beast from the earth – it was said
      from Makkah, or from elsewhere – and it will speak to the people
      concerning that. Ibn ‘Abbaas, al-Hasan and al-Qutaadah said – and it
      was also narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib – (may Allaah be pleased
      with them all): it will speak to them, i.e., it will address them.
      ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasaani said – and it was narrated from ‘Ali and this
      was the view favourd by Ibn Jareer: it will speak to them and it will say
      to them, ‘mankind believed not with
      certainty in Our Ayaat’. There are some reservations about this interpretation, and Allaah
      knows best.
 According
      to one report, Ibn ‘Abbaas said: the words tukallimuhum
      (to speak to them) means, it will wound them;
      according to another report he said: it will do both (i.e., speak to them
      and wound them). [The
      word Tukallim
      may mean either speak or wound. – Translator].
      This is a good point with no contradictions, and Allaah knows best.
 (Tafseer
      al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem,
      3/375-378)
 Many
      ahaadeeth and reports have been narrated about the beast, such as the
      following:

      whilst we were talking about the Hour. He said: “The Hour will not come
      until you see ten signs: the rising of the sun from the west; the smoke;
      the beast; the emergence of Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj; the appearance of
      ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him); the Dajjaal (“antichrist”);
      three landslides – one in the west, one in the east and one in the
      Arabian Peninsula; and fire which will emerge from the direction of
      ‘Aden and will drive – or gather – the people, stopping with them
      whenever they rest overnight or during the siesta hour.” 
(Narrated by
      Imaam Ahmed, no. 46 – his version is his; also by Muslim, no 2901; Abu
      Dawood, no. 4311; al-Tirmidhi, no. 2183 - he said it is hasan saheeh;
      al-Nasaa’i, no. 1138; Ibn Maajah, no. 4055).
 It
      was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
      of Allaah be upon him) said:
“There
      are three things which, when they appear, it will not benefit anyone to
      believe if he did not believe before: the Dajjaal, the beast and the
      rising of the sun from the west – or from the place where it sets.”
(Narrated by
      al-Tirmidhi, no. 3072; he said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth).
 It
      was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
 “Hasten
      to do good deeds before six things come to pass: the rising of the sun
      from the place where it sets; the smoke; the Dajjaal; the beast; or
      personal calamities or general tribulations.”
(narrated
      by Muslim, no. 2947; Ibn Maajah, no. 4056, and others).
      There are many ahaadeeth which speak of the beast which will emerge at the
      end of time, but it would take too long to quote them all here. And Allaah
      is the Source of strength.
 Further
      evidence that the Qur’aan will be taken away at the end of time is to be
      found in the report narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam
      al-Kabeer, no. 8698, according to which Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with
      him) said: 
“This
      Qur’aan will most certainly be taken away from amongst you.” He was
      asked: “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, how will it be taken away when it is so
      deeply rooted in our hearts and is written in our mus-hafs?” He said:
      “Something will come to it at night, then there will be nothing left of
      it in people’s hearts or in the mus-haf, and the next morning the people
      will be like animals.” Then he recited the aayah (interpretation of the
      meaning): “And if We
      willed, We could surely, take away that which We have revealed to you
      (i.e. this Qur’aan). Then you would find no protector for you against Us
      in that respect” [al-Israa’ 17:86].
      Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari
      (13/16): its isnaad is saheeh but it is mawqoof. Al-Haythami said in Majma’
      al-Zawaa’id, 7/329): its men are the men of saheeh, apart
      from Shaddaad ibn Ma’qil, who is thiqah. And it was classed as saheeh by
      al-Albaani.
 This
      hadeeth is to be regarded as marfoo’, because it deals with something
      which is not subject to opinion orijtihaad.
 Imaam Ibn
      Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’
      al-Fataawaa (3/198): “At the end of time, something will come
      to it at night in the mus-hafs and in people’s hearts,then there will not be left one word of it in people’s hearts or
      one letter of it in the Mus-haf.”
 Allaah
      revealed the Qur’aan as a guidance to mankind and He guaranteed to
      protect it. It is the eternal miracle of the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it will remain, and people of earlier
      and later generations will learn from it and be guided by it, but at the
      end of time, just before the Hour comes, Allaah will take the souls of the
      believers, and there will be no one left on earth except the most evil of
      people. There will be no prayer, no fasting, no Hajj and no charity
      (zakaah). Then there will be no point in the Ka’bah being there or in
      the Qur’aan remaining among mankind, so Allaah will decree that the
      Ka’bah be destroyed at the hands of a kaafir from Ethiopia.Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh,
      no. 1519 that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said: “The Ka’bah will be destroyed by Dhu’l-Suwayqatayn from
      Ethiopia.” And Allaah will take the Qur’aan away from the earth, and
      not one aayah of it will be left in the mus-hafs or in people’s hearts.
      Allaah will not permit His Book to remain on earth if it is not
      benefitting anyone and no one is acting in accordance with it. So this
      thing will come to pass.
This
      frightening event makes the sincere Muslim hasten to pay attention to the
      Book of Allaah, to learn it, memorize it, recite it and ponder its
      meanings, before the Book is taken away.
This
      is one of the tribulations that will happen at the end of time, concerning
      which our Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“Hasten to do
      good deeds before tribulations come like patches of dark night, when a man
      will wake up as a believer and by evening he will be a kaafir, or in the
      evening he will be a believer and by morning he will be a kaafir, selling
      his religion for some worldly gains.” (narrated by Muslim, no. 169).
 We ask
      Allaah to make us adhere firmly to His religion and to protect us from
      tribulations, both seen and unseen."
913,3098,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3098,It is not permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj except with a mahram,"Question

Is it possible for a women to go to hajj or umrah in a group of people or in a group of women if there is no mahram willing to go with her?.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars, past and present, differed concerning this issue. Some of them said that it is permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj without a mahram if the road is safe and she is with a trustworthy group. 
Some of them said that it is not permissible for her to travel except with a mahram who can protect her, even if she is with a trustworthy group. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and Ahmad. They quoted the following as evidence: 
1 – It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless there is a mahram with her.”  A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, I want to go out with such and such an army, and my wife wants to go for Hajj.” He said: “Go for Hajj with her.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1763) and Muslim (1341). 
2 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel for the distance of one day and one night except with her mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1038) and Muslim (133). According to al-Bukhari (1139) and Muslim (827), from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed: “The distance of two days.” 
Ibn Hajar said: 
In the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed it is limited to “the distance of two days” and in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah it is limited to “the distance of one day and one night.” There are also other reports. In the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar it is limited to “three days” and there are other reports too. 
Al-Nawawi said: The apparent meaning of this definition is not what is meant, rather everything that is regarded as travel is forbidden to a woman unless she has a mahram with her. The definition of the limits was in reference to specific incidents. Ibn al-Muneer said: The differences in the definitions arose because there was different questioners in different situations. 
End quote. 
Fath al-Baari (4/75). 
Secondly: 
Those who say that a mahram is not required quoted the following as evidence: 
1 – It was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man came to him and complained of poverty. Then another came and complained about banditry. He said: “O ‘Adiyy have you seen al-al-Heerah?” I said: “I have not seen it, but I have been told about it.” He said: “If you live a long life, you will see a woman travelling from al-Heerah until she circumambulates the Ka’bah, fearing no one but Allah.” … ‘Adiyy said: And I saw a woman travelling from al-Heerah until she circumambulated the Ka’bah, fearing no one but Allah. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari (3400). 
This argument may be countered by noting that this was simply the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) foretelling this incident. Speaking of an incident does not mean that it is permissible. Rather it may be permissible or not, depending on the shar’i evidence. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also foretold that drinking alcohol, zina and a great deal of killing would become widespread before the Hour begins, and these are things that are forbidden and are major sins.
What is meant by the hadeeth is that security would become widespread, so that women would feel emboldened and one of them would travel without a mahram. It does not mean that it is permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Not everything that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) foretold as signs of the Hour is haram or forbidden. If the shepherds compete in erecting tall buildings, and wealth becomes widespread, and there is one man to look after fifty women, these things are undoubtedly not haram. Rather these are signs, and a sign has nothing to do with whether it is halaal or haram. Rather a sign may be good or bad, permissible or haram or obligatory or anything else. And Allah knows best. End quote. 
It should be noted that the difference of scholarly opinion regarding the necessity of having a mahram in order to perform Hajj applies to the obligatory Hajj only. As for naafil (supererogatory) Hajj, the scholars are all agreed that it is not permissible for a woman to travel except with a mahram or husband, as it says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (17/36). 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: A woman who does not have a mahram is not obliged to perform Hajj, because having a mahram is part of being able for it, and being able for it is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
It is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj or anything else unless she has her husband or mahram with her. This is the view of al-Hasan, al-Nakha’i, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Ibn al-Mundhir and Ashaab al-Ra’y, and this is the correct view, because of the verse quoted above as well as the general meaning of the ahaadeeth which forbid a woman to travel without her husband or mahram. Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and al-Awzaa’i disagreed with that and they stipulated conditions for which they do not have any proof. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They ignored the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, and each of them stipulated conditions for which they did not have any proof. End quote. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (11/90, 91). 
They also said: 
The correct view is that it is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj except with her husband or her mahram. It is not permissible for her to travel with trustworthy women without a mahram, or with her paternal aunt, maternal aunt or mother. Rather it is essential that she be with her husband or a mahram. 
If she cannot find someone to accompany her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj so long as that is the case.

I am a Christian who is very interested in Islam and I am currently reading a translation of the Koran in my language. I know that women should not touch the Koran while having their menses but since translations are not regarded as the word of God and therefore not equal to the Arabic text, I'd like to know if not touching the Koran during menses also applies to translations.
Thank you very much for your help.",,"Praise be to Allah.You have hit the nail on the head: your guess is correct. A translation is not like the Mus-haf (Arabic text of the Quraan) and the same rules do not apply. A translation is like a tafseer (commentary), and so a menstruating woman is allowed to touch it. Your analysis of this matter demonstrates astute reasoning and excellent thinking skills, which makes us feel that you will soon embrace Islam; may Allaah guide you to all good.

magazines","Question

                What is the ruling on publishing magazines that carry pictures of women, ideas that go against Islam and interviews with female performers and women who are adorned with the adornment tabarruj of the
      modern jaahiliyyah ?",,"Praise be to Allah.The mutawaatir reports of the Sunnah show that 
  making pictures or images is absolutely haraam and those who make pictures are 
  cursed. Every maker of pictures will be in Hell, and every picture or image 
  that he made will be given a soul and he will be punished by it in Hell. The 
  makers of pictures will be the most severely punished of people. The picture-maker 
  will be told to breathe life into the images he made; they will be punished 
  and will be told, “Give life to that which you have created!” The 
  prohibition is multiplied if these pictures cause temptation, such as pictures 
  of naked women, or pictures of men with women. If that is haraam, then how about 
  the magazines that promote this and call people to temptation, immorality, promiscuity 
  and the means of doing wrong? Anyone who publishes such magazines, or sells 
  them, gives them as a gift or buys them, partakes in the sin. The Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed wine and the one who sells 
  it, the one who buys it, the one who makes it, the one for whom it is made, 
  the one who drinks it, the one who serves it, the one who carries it, the one 
  to whom it is carried, and the one who profits from it. The same applies to 
  these magazines, whose bad effect on people’s morals, chastity and religion 
  is sometimes worse than that of alcohol, especially when they contain deviant 
  ideas and news of female performers and women who adorn themselves in the manner 
  of jaahiliyyah. Publishing these magazines, writing articles for them, importing 
  them and publicizing them means that one is taking part in this corruption, 
  spreading immorality and calling for promiscuity, social disintegration and 
  deviation from correct morals and modesty. Our advice to anyone who wants to 
  attain salvation is to keep away from these magazines and have nothing to do 
  with them in the slightest, in the hope of saving oneself and keeping one’s 
  religion and honour safe. And Allaah knows best."

What is the ruling on publishing magazines in which uncovered women appear in a tempting way and which deal with news of actors and actresses?

It is not permissible to work as an editor, writer or distributor for such magazines, because this involves co-operating in sin, spreading mischief throughout the land, calling for the corruption of society and propagating promiscuity. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily Allah is Severe in punishment.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls to right guidance will have a reward equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his reward; and whoever calls to misguidance will bear sin equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his sin.” (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4831).
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait and with their heads looking like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such-and-such a distance.”

                Sometimes my colleagues at college or at
      work ask me to make it look as if they are present even though they are absent, so that
      when the attendance sheet comes around, I should write their names. Is this a human
      service or is it deception and cheating?",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of service, but it is satanic service which the Shaytaan
    is instilling in the person who does this and makes it appear that someone is present when
    this is not the case. There are three reasons for having reservations about this practice:
(1) It is lying; (2) it involves deceiving those who are in charge; (3)
    it makes the absent person entitled to wages on the basis of attendance, which he then
    takes and consumes unlawfully. One of these reservations alone is sufficient to make this
    practice, which the questioner apparently sees as a human service or favour, be described
    as haraam. Not all human favours are praiseworthy; only those that coincide with
    sharee’ah are praiseworthy – those that go against sharee’ah are to be
    condemned. Calling favours that go against sharee’ah “human services” is in
    fact a misnomer, because anything that goes against sharee’ah is a bestial action.
    This is why Allaah described the kuffaar and mushrikeen as being like cattle. He says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “… while those who disbelieve enjoy
    themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire will be their abode.” [Muhammad 47:12]
    and “…They are only like cattle; - nay, they are even farther astray from the

919,3119,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3119,How to Calculate Mahr in Islam,"Question

What is the minimum amount of mahr (Dowry) permitted by Shari’ah? I found in one book, the dowry of most of the wives and daughters of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was 480 Dirhams. What is the equivalent amount for the present time?","It is permissible for the mahr to be a little or a lot of whatever is considered to be wealth, if both partners agree. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.Minimum amount of mahr in Islam
The minimum amount of mahr has been explained in the report in al-Sahih (no. 1425) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Sa’idi, who said: “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have come to give myself (in marriage) to you.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at her and looked her up and down, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lowered his head and paused. When the woman saw that he had not made a decision about her, she sat down. A man from among the Sahabah said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, if you are not interested in her, then marry her to me.’ He said, ‘Do you have anything?’ He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said, ‘Go to your people and see if you can find anything.’ So the man went, then he came back and said, ‘No, by Allah, I could not find anything.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Look and see (if you can find anything), even if it is only an iron ring which you can give.’ So he went, then came back, and said,  ‘No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, not even an iron ring. But (I have) this izar (garment) of mine, she can have half of it.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘What can she do with your izar? If you are wearing it she will have nothing of it.’ The man sat down, then after a long time had passed, he got up (to leave). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him leaving and called him. When he came, he said, ‘What do you know of the Quran ?’ He said, ‘Soorah Such-and-Such and Soorah Such-and-Such.’ He said, ‘Do you know them by heart?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Then go, you are married to her by what you know of the Quran.’” 
This hadith shows that it is permissible for the mahr to be a little or a lot of whatever is considered to be wealth, if both partners agree, because an iron ring is extremely little. This is the madhhab of al-Shafi’i and is also the view of the majority of scholars among the earlier and later generations. 
This was also the view of Rabi’ah, Abu’l-Zinad, Ibn Abi Dhib, Yahya ibn Sa’id, al-Layth ibn Sa’d, al-Thawri, al-Awza’i, Muslim ibn Khalid, Ibn Abi Layla, Dawud, the fuqaha of the scholars of hadith and Ibn Wahb among the companions of Malik. It was also the view of all the scholars of the Hijaz, Basrah, Kufa and Syria, and others, that whatever the couple agree upon is permissible (as a dowry), whether it is a lot or a little, such as a whip, a pair of shoes or an iron ring, etc. 
Mahr of the Mothers of the Believers
With regard to the question about the mahr of the Mothers of the Believers: 
Muslim narrated in his Sahih (no. 1426) that Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman said: “I asked ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), what the mahr given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was. She said: ‘The mahr that he gave to his wives was twelve uqiyah and a nashsh.’ He said, Do you know what a nashsh is? He said, she said it is half of an uqiyah. That was five hundred dirhams. This was the mahr given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to his wives.” 
Ibn Khaldun said: 
“The consensus of the scholars from the beginning of Islam and the time of the Sahabah and the Taabi’in has been that the shar’i dirham is that of which ten coins weigh seven mithqals of gold. The uqiyah is forty dirhams of this type, and on this basis it is seven-tenths of a dinar… All of these amounts are agreed upon by scholarly consensus (ijma’).” (Al-Muqaddimah, p. 263) 
Based on this, the weight of a dirham in grams is 2.975 grams. 
So the mahr of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was 500 x 2.975 = 1487.5 grams of silver. 
The price of one gram of pure silver that has not been worked is approximately 1 riyal, so the mahr in riyals is approximately 1487.5 riyals. In dollars it is approximately $396.70 (this varies depending on the present price of silver).

        one of the dazzling tricks of the Shaytaan, and it usually happens with regard to things
        that Allaah has forbidden. If a man finds that he likes a girl, the only option he has is
        to ask her guardian (walee) for permission to marry her.
The mans mothers comment that new Muslims cannot be good
        Muslims is false. Were the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) anything but new
        Muslims, given that prior to their Islam they had been believers in Shirk? Does any
        Muslim have any doubts about their commitment to religion and their character? Moreover,
        we see that many new Muslims are many times better than many (born) Muslims! Just because
        a Muslim is new does not mean that he will never be good, and just because a Muslim is
        born in Islam does not mean that he is good. What counts is Taqwa (piety, awareness of
        Allaah) and righteous deeds, as well as the length of time one has been in Islam and has
        been worshipping Allaah.
There is no reason why knowledge of the man's marriage should not be
        withheld from his parents, especially since this is in the interests of the sister and
        there are so few people who can help her to overcome her difficulties. It is the woman who
        needs a walee according to shareeah, not the man. However, we would prefer that he
        wins his familys approval by convincing them, because this is in their best
        interests, benefits which may be lost if they find out that their son concealed his
        marriage from them.
The fact that the husband says he wants to call the children to Islam is
        good. We ask Allaah to help him to achieve this. The fact that the Hindu father is evil is
        sufficient reason for him not to make an open display of his calling the children to
        Islam, if that could lead to this kaafir taking the children away by going to the kaafir
        courts. You have to act with wisdom in this case.
The woman who is asking this question should not arrange her own
        marriage even if she has been previously married, because shareeah does not permit
        this. If she does not have a walee as required by shareeah, then her walee may be
        the qaadi (judge) or whoever is in charge of the Muslim affairs in her country, such as
        the head of the Islamic centre or his deputy.
They  especially the sister  have to seek the help of Allaah
        in dealing with these problems which are giving her sleepless nights. Everyone should know
        that whoever puts his trust in Allaah, Allaah will show him a way out. She has to make
        duaa sincerely, and he has to try as hard as he can to advise his family and
        change their views about new Muslims by showing them real examples of people who are the
        opposite of what they think. With regard to the tragedy caused by the former husband, we
        advise her again not to make an open display of her calling the children to Islam, lest
        that should cause the father to do something that will have bad consequences. If they feel
        suspicious about his intentions, there is no harm in calling the police to do whatever is
        necessary with regard to him.
If getting married means that the sister will lose her right to custody
        of her children, we advise her not to get married now, for fear that these two souls may
        end up in Hell in the Hereafter  unless she fears that she herself may commit some
        immoral action, in which case she should marry the Muslim man whom she has told us about,
        with witnesses and a walee as we have stated above. Publicizing the marriage is sunnah,
        although it does not have to be announced officially and in writing. But this sister has
        to live in a protective Muslim environment and those people will have to know about her
        marriage lest she bring upon herself gossip about her honour. If it will be better for her
        to leave the place where her ex-husband lives and move to another place where she can be
        free, have custody of her children and be able to marry a believing Muslim man who will
        protect her and her children, then she should do that.
She has to make duaa and turn to Allaah to relieve her
        distress and grief. We pray that Allaah will give her the strength to do that which He
        loves and which pleases Him.
And Allaah knows best."

923,3143,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3143,Why does Islam Continue to be Successful in the Developed World?,"Question

Why has Islam continued to be so successful in the modern world?",,"Praise be to Allah.Islam continues to be successful in the developed world, and elsewhere, because its call is in accordance with the fitrah or natural inclinations of mankind, and it advocates the best of human values, such as tolerance, love, mercy, truthfulness and sincerity.
Islam educates people and lifts them up to righteous conduct, good manners and virtue. Its call is distinguished from others by its realism, balance and moderation. Islam pays due attention to both the soul and the body. It neither suppresses physical desires nor allows extravagance in this regard; it makes a distinction between the natural inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this world and forbidden desires that come under the heading of depravity and perversion.
People embrace Islam because they find security, comfort and peace in it, they see a cure for their problems in it, and through it they are able to get rid of their feelings of confusion, anxiety and loss.
Islam is the religion of the fitrah, the natural inclination or pattern on which Allah has created mankind. For this reason, people of sound minds and upright inclinations embrace Islam, as Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (i.e., Islam), then his parents make him into a Jew, a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian), just as animals produce whole animals (i.e., the animals are born perfect with no part of their bodies missing). Do you find any born with their ears cut off?’” Then Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘… Allah’s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the Standard Religion…’ [al-Room 30:30 – interpretation of the meaning – Yusuf Ali’s translation].”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1359). What is meant is that Allah has created mankind with the potential to learn the truth, accept Tawheed (pure monotheism) and submit to Allah. Their natural inclination is to learn Islam and love it, but a bad education, a disbelieving environment, their own whims and desires and the devils among jinn and mankind turn them away from the truth. Mankind is basically inclined towards Tawheed (pure monotheism), as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reported that his Lord (Allah) said: “I created all my slaves as ‘hunafa’ (pure monetheists), but the devils turned them away from their religion.” (Reported by Muslim). For this reason the one who becomes a Muslim after having been a disbeliever is described as having “reverted” to Islam, as this is more correct than saying that he “converted.” When Islam enters a country where there is no nationalism or great legacy of jaahiliyah (ignorance), it spreads quickly because of its strength and the small number of obstacles. You may also see that Islam is suitable for all people, educated and uneducated, male and female, old and young; everyone finds in it what he wants and needs. Those who become Muslim in developed countries realize what their country’s civilization and laws, which have been fabricated from men’s whims and desires, have done to them, and they realize the extent of the misery in which people in developed countries are living. They see how prevalent psychological illnesses, nervous breakdowns, insanity and suicides are, despite the technological advances and great number of discoveries and inventions and modern systems of management. This is because all of that is concerned only with the physical and the outward, but it neglects the inward and fails to nourish and nurture the heart and soul. Allah says of these people (interpretation of the meaning): “They know only the outside appearance of the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.” [al-Room 30:7]
Islam will continue to succeed, with the permission of Allah, so long as those who work for its sake are sincere and its followers adhere to it and believe in it, and apply its laws.
The fact that there are those who are not committed or who fall short will not prevent Islam from succeeding, with the permission of Allah, and nothing can distort its beauty. Its light will not falter because some people abandon it or fail to adhere to it. What Islam has given humanity in the way of progress and civilization, and lifting them up from the darkness of oppression and enmity, is pride enough."

I have a plural marriage,and a son (five years old), who is not the biological son of the husband.
Do the other wives have to be fully covered in hijab when this boy is present.",,"Praise be to Allah.The boy mentioned is young, and women do not need to cover their faces when he is present. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And say to the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at illegal things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.), and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like palms or hands or one eye or both eyes for necessity to see the way, our outer dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron, etc.), and to draw their veils all over juyoobihinna (i.e., their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms, etc.), and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, their husbands sons, their brothers or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e., their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful. [al-Noor 24:31]
This little boy is a small child who has no sense of the shame of sex, so it is permissible to uncover one's adornment in front of him. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: The words (interpretation of the meaning), or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex refer to children who because of their young age do not understand anything about women or the temptation they may present, such as their soft voices or the way they walk. Because the child is so young, he does not understand anything about that, so there is nothing wrong with letting him enter upon women. But if a boy is approaching puberty and beginning to understand these things and to distinguish between who is beautiful and who is not, then he should not be allowed to enter upon women.

                My question is regarding the suppression of
    sexual desires. In this country, at this age, it is very difficult not to get aroused
    several times a day. I hope you can understand. This causes stress while praying because a
    drop or two may come out and during the whole prayer I am worried about it. Also, it
    delays my performing the prayer. You said masturbation is not allowed. And you mentioned
    fasting. Due to my circumstances fasting voluntary fasts regularly is not feasible as it
    makes me too tired to study and concentrate. Also I am not able to marry now. This
    situation might continue for years if Allah grants me that long a life. Can I therefore
    castrate myself or take drugs that suppress sexual desires? I think the good that such a
    measure would do will outweigh the harm and make me steadfast in my prayer and
    concentration.But I wanted your advice before I take any steps .",,"Praise be to Allah.Fasting is not only a remedy, it is also a purification of
    the soul and a means of earning reward and the pleasure of Allaah. It is also a striving
    against one’s desires. With a little patience and the hope of earning reward, one can
    get used to fasting. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was
    prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
    [al-Baqarah 2:183]
In the Tafseer of this aayah it was said that according to one opinion,
    the phrase “that you may become al-muttaqoon” means: that you may stay
    away from sin, because fasting is more of a deterrent and is more effective in keeping one
    from falling into sin. This is one of the meanings of the hadeeth, “Let him fast for
    that will be a protection for him.” Many people think that this is because fasting
    weakens the body and thus weakens desire. Even if that is the case, it is in addition to
    the fact that fasting motivates a person to keep away from anything that he fears may
    affect him adversely, either because of the blessing of the fast itself or because if the
    one who is fasting has to refrain from food and drink that are permissible, it is even
    more appropriate that he should keep away from things which are forbidden.
Fataawa al-Subki, part 1: al-Siyaam: Hifz al-Siyaam
    ‘an Fawt al-Tamaam
When young people who are unable to marry were commanded to fast, this is
    a sign of the wisdom and insight of the Lawgiver. It is clear that fasting has an effect
    in this regard and that it helps to control desire and reduce provocation.
With regard to your question about taking medication that can reduce
    desire, there is no reason why you cannot take some herbal extracts etc. to control your
    desires, so long as they are not harmful in any way. But this will not be of much help if
    you do not do some acts of worship to fill your time and other activities to use up your
    physical energy, such as Da’wah activities and helping those in need. Also reduce
    your intake of rich foods, do some sports activities, keep yourself busy with useful
    things, and make yourself a schedule that will use up your excess physical energy. Do not
    forget that it is also very important to keep away from sources of provocation. Be
    optimistic and do not think that you will remain in this situation for many years. May
    Allaah make it easy for you to marry soon. May He protect us and you from evil and guide
    us to the Straight Path."

      fold of Islam, then reverting back to Hinduism. I,being the eldest of all the children, do
      not understand how to handle this situation. From all the brothers & sisters, I am the
      only one who is still very close to her. Should the inevitable happen one day, how should
      I handle this situation.",,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that your mother in is need of care and compassion, and at the
    same time she seems to be feeling some nostalgia for the past, by wishing to go back to
    her former corrupt religion. The former stems from her losing her position through the
    divorce which has taken place, so you and your brothers and sisters must make up for what
    she has lost to reduce the pain and bitterness of the humiliation she has suffered through
    this divorce. Most of the responsibility will fall on your shoulders because you are the
    closest of her children to her, as you say. You must enjoin your brothers and sisters to
    fulfil their duties of caring for her and looking after her, by speaking kindly to her,
    consoling her gently, serving her, taking care of her affairs, spending on her, visiting
    her, keeping in touch and upholding the ties of kinship, until things settle down for her
    and she feels better.
With regard to the second issue, her nostalgia for her former, corrupt
    religion, you must deal with this problem by advising her and making the effort to explain
    the seriousness of apostasy and returning to kufr. Tell her about the hadeeth of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There are three things, if
    a person has them, he has found the sweetness of faith: if Allaah and His Messenger are
    more beloved to him than anyone or anything else; if he loves another and does not love
    him for any reason other than for the sake of Allaah; and if he would hate to return to
    kufr after Allaah has saved him from it as much as he would hate to be thrown into the
    fire.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. This version was narrated by
    Muslim in his Saheeh, no. 460).
    Alarm her with the aayah (interpretation of the
    meaning): “Verily, those who have turned their backs as disbelievers after the
    guidance has been manifested to them, Shaytaan has beautified for them (their false
    hopes), and (Allaah) prolonged their term (age).” [Muhammad 47:25]. Explain to
    her the fate of the apostate as described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the
    meaning): “…And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a
    disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will
    be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever.” [al-Baqarah 2:217].
If you try your hardest, you will not be to blame if something that you
    dislike happens after that. But whatever the case, you must not carry out any last wishes
    or will to burn the body after death (cremation), because this is something that is viewed
    as abhorrent in Islamic sharee’ah (see Question #675). We ask Allaah for guidance and
    steadfastness in Islam, and for a good end, for your mother and for all the Muslims. May
    Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

With regard to du`a’s to do with repentance that you can recite every day and whilst at work, al-hamdulillah there are many such du`a’s, among the greatest of which are as follows:
“Rabbi’ghfir wa’rham wa anta khayru’l-raahimeen (My Lord! Forgive and show mercy, for You are the Best of those who show mercy!)” [al-Mu’minoon 23:118 – interpretation of the meaning].
“Rabbanaa ‘ghfar lanaa dhunoobanaa wa israafanaa fi amrinaa (Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and transgressions (in keeping our duties to You).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:147 – interpretation of the meaning].
Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer for seeking forgiveness is to say: ‘Allahumma anta rabbi la ilaaha illa anta, Khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’t. A’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu, aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfiru’l-dhunoob illaa anta (O Allah, You are my Lord. None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).” Whoever says this during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will be among the people of Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5831).
Abu Moosa reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite the following du`a’: “Allahumma’ghfir li khatee’ati wa jahli wa israafi fi amri wa maa anta a’lam bihi minni. Allahumma’ghfir li jiddi wa hazli wa khata’i wa ‘amdi wa kullu dhaalika ‘indi. Allahumma’ghfir li maa qaddamtu wa maa ajjartu wa ma asrartu wa maa a’lamtu wa maa anta a’lam bihi minni.

Ibn ‘Umar reported that the people counted for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he recited one hundred times in one gathering: “Raabi’ghfir li wa tubb ‘alayya innaka anta’l-tawwaab ul-ghafoor (My Lord, forgive me and accept my repentance, for You are the Acceptor of Repentance, the All-Forgiving).” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3356.

                Some people joining a person who is known to be praying fardh salat if they have the intention of making a jamaah. does it matter that the 'imam' had no intention to be in a congregation?.",,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is permissible for a person who is praying alone to intend 
    to lead the prayer, and act as imaam for those who join him in the prayer. 
    The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (667) and 
    Muslim (763) from Ibn ‘Abbaas who said: “I stayed one night with my maternal 
    aunt Maymoonah bint al-Haarith, and I said to her, ‘When the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gets up, wake me up 
    so that I can pray qiyaam al-layl.’ The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) got up, and I got up and stood beside him 
    on his left. He took my hand and made me stand on his right, and whenever I 
    closed my eyes he tweaked my ear, then he prayed eleven rak’ahs, then he 
    slept until I could hear the sound of his breathing. When Fajr came he 
    prayed two short rak’ahs. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 667; Muslim, 763). 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) started praying alone, then when Ibn ‘Abbaas joined him in prayer, he 
    led him in the prayer. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this 
    question: 

    If I enter the mosque after the congregation (jamaa’ah) has 
    finished praying, and I say the iqaamah for the prayer and say “Allaahu 
    akbar” to start the prayer, then a man comes in after me and joins me in my 
    prayer, and I did not intend that, is his prayer valid or not? 

    He answered: 

    The correct view is that it is prescribed for you to form the 
    intention of leading the prayer when one or more persons join you in prayer, 
    because praying in congregation is something that is required and there is a 
    great deal of virtue in that. Some of the scholars are of the view that this 
    is valid in naafil prayers, but the correct view is that it is valid in both 
    naafil (supererogatory) and fard (obligatory) prayers, because the basic 
    principle is that the rulings on both are the same, except in cases where 
    there is specific evidence. It was proven that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray on his own at night in the 
    house of Maymoonah, the maternal aunt of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them all). Ibn ‘Abbaas got up, did wudoo’ and stood to the left of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made him move to his right. 
    (Agreed upon) and led him in prayer. 

    Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was praying alone, and Jaabir 
    and Jabbaar came to him and stood to his right and his left. He made them 
    stand behind him and led them in prayer. These two hadeeth indicate what we 
    have mentioned. They also indicate that if there is only one other person, 
    he should stand to the right of the imam, and if there are two or more they 
    should stand behind him.

935,3214,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3214,How Was the Order of the Quran Determined?,"Question

Why were not the surahs of the Quran ordered according to the order of revelation?",There is scholarly consensus that the order of the verses in the Surahs was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). There were differences among scholars concerning the order of Surahs. The majority of scholars favored the view that this was the ijtihad of the Companions. Other scholars view that the order of surahs in the Quran was also instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).,"Praise be to Allah.Order of verses in one Surah
The fact there is scholarly consensus, and many texts stating the order of verses in one Surah, that is very well known. The consensus was reported by many scholars, including Al-Zarkashi in al-Burhan and Abu Ja’far, who said: “The order of the verses in their Surahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no dispute among the Muslims with regard to this matter.”
The texts regarding this matter include the following:

The report narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim from Ibn `Abbas, who said: “I said to ‘Uthman, ‘What made you put al-Anfal which is one of the Mathani, next to Bara-ah [al-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi’in? Why did you not put the line Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of al-Sab’ al-Tiwal [the long seven Surahs]?” ‘Uthman said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to receive revelation of Surahs with many verses. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these verses in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs to be revealed in Madinah, and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Quran to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in al-Anfal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillahir Rahman ir’Rahim was not written between them, and it [al-Tawbah] was put among the Sab’ al-Tiwal [seven long Surahs].” (Al-Hakim said: its isnad is sahih, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak, 2/330)
Ahmad narrated in al-Musnad (4/218) with a hasan isnad from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-‘As that he said: “I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he fixed his gaze on something, then lowered his gaze until he was almost looking at the ground, then he gazed at something. He said, ‘Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me to put this verse in this place in this Surah: “Verily, Allâh enjoins Al-‘Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allâh Alone Islâmic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsân [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allâh, totally for Allâh’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allâh has ordered you to give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahshâ (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar (i.e. all that is prohibited by Islâmic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.” [al-Nahl 16:90 – interpretation of the meaning].’”
Al-Bukhari narrated in al-Sahih (no. 4536) that Ibn Abi Malikah said: “Ibn al-Zubayr said: ‘I said to ‘Uthman, “This verse that is in al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning), ‘And those of you who die and leave wives behind them … And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s maintenance and residence without turning them out’ [al-Baqarah 2:234-240] has been abrogated by the other, so why are you writing it down?” He said, “Leave it as it is, my nephew, I will not change anything from its place.”’”
Muslim narrated (no. 1617) that ‘Umar said: “I did not ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about anything more than I asked him about al-Kalalah [those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs], until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said, “Is not ayat al-sayf at the end of Surat al-Nisa enough for you?”
There are also the hadiths about the verses at the end of Surat al-Baqarah.
Muslim narrated (no. 809) from Abu al-Darda that whoever memorizes the first ten verses of Surat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal; according to another version, whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected.

The Prophet’s recitation of various Surahs in the presence of his Companions indicates that the order of their verses is something that was instituted and commanded by him, and that the Companions did not put the verses in a different order from that in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite them. The reports to that effect reach the level of Mutawatir.
Al-Qadi Abu Bakr said in al-Intisar: 
“The order of the verses is something that is obligatory and binding. Jibril used to say (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), ‘Put such and such an verse in such and such a place.’”
He also said:
 “What we think is that all of the Quran which Allah revealed and commanded that it should be written down, and which was not abrogated after being revealed, is that which is contained between the covers of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman, and that there is nothing lacking or added to it. Its order is the same as that commanded by Allah, may He be exalted, and instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Nobody has moved any verse backwards or forwards. The Ummah learned from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the order of the verses of each Surah properly, just as they learned from him the correct pronunciation and recitation.”
Al-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah: 
“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to instruct his Companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the Quran in the order in which it appears in our Mus-hafs now, the order which Jibril taught him. When each verse was revealed, Jibril would tell him, this verse is to be written after such and such a verse in Surah such and such. Thus it is clear that the efforts of the Companions were limited solely to gathering the Quran in one place, not to arranging its order. The Quran is written on al-Lawh al-Mahfuz in this order, then Allah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven, whence it was revealed in stages as it was needed, and the order in which it was revealed is not the order in which it is recited.”
Order of Surahs in the Quran
With regard to the order of Surahs, was this also instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or was this the ijtihad of the Companions? With regard to this question, there were differences among the scholars. The majority of scholars, including Malik and al-Qadi Abu Bakr, according to one of his two opinions, favoured the second opinion.
Ibn Faris said: 
“There were two aspects to the compilation of the Quran. One was putting the Surahs in a certain order, such as putting al-Sab’ al-Tiwal (the seven long Surahs) first, and following them with the Mi’in, which is what the Companions did. The second aspect is the compilation of the verses within the Surahs. This was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who recited them as he was told to by Jibreel, on the command of his Lord. On this basis, the Salaf differed as to the order in which the Surahs should appear. Some of them put them in order of revelation, which was the mus-haf of ‘Ali, which started with Iqra (al-‘Alaq), then al-Muddaththir, then Nun (al-Qalam), then al-Muzzammil, and so on. The Mus-haf of Ibn Mas’ud started with al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa, then Al ‘Imran, with other major differences. The Mus-haf of Ubayy was similar.”
Al-Karmani said in al-Burhan: the order of the Surahs as it is now is the same as that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz which is with Allah. This is the order in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to review the Surahs of the Quran he had received so far with Jibril each year. In the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice, and the last verses to be revealed were (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allah…’ [al-Baqarah 2:281]. Jibril commanded the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to put this between the verses dealing with riba and those dealing with loans.”
Al-Zarkashi said in al-Burhan: “The difference between the two views is one of wording. Those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that they could learn the reasons of Revelation and the sequence of the words. Hence Malik said that they compiled the Quran according to what they had heard from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as well as saying that the order of the Surahs was the product of their ijtihad. He said that the dispute boils down to one question which is: was this a verbal instruction of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or were they merely referring to what he used to do, which would give them room for ijtihad.”
Al-Bayhaqi said in al-Madkhil: “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Surahs and verses of the Quran were in this order, except for al-Anfal and Bara-ah (al-Tawbah), as we see from the hadith of ‘Uthman referred to above.”
Ibn ‘Atiyah said: “The order of many of the Surahs was known during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the seven long Surahs, those that begin with Ha’-Mim, and al-Mufassal. With regard to the others, it may be the case that it was left for the Ummah to determine their order after he died.”
Abu Ja’far said: “The reports support most of what Ibn ‘Atiyah said, and a little is left which is open to debate, such as the hadith, ‘Recite the two shining ones, al-Baqarah and Al ‘Imran.’” (Reported by Muslim, no. 804)
Al-Bukhari narrated (no. 4739) that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Bani Israil (al-Isra), al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya, these are among the earliest and most beautiful Surahs and they are my treasures,” (meaning, these are among the earliest I recited).
Abu Ja’far al-Nahhas al-Mukhtar said that the Surahs were compiled in this order from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because of the hadith of Wathilah, “In place of the Tawrat I was given the seven long Surahs.” He said: “This hadith indicates that the order of the Quran was taken from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Ibn Hajar said, “the fact that the Surahs, or most of them, are in a given order does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What proves that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud from Aws ibn Hudhayfah, who said: ‘We asked the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the morning, “How did you write down the Quran in chapters?” They said, “We wrote it down in chapters of six Surahs, five Surahs, seven Surahs, nine Surahs, eleven Surahs and thirteen Surahs, and the chapter of al-Mufassal, from Qaf until the end. This indicates that the order of the Surahs – as it appears in the Mus-haf now – existed at the time of the Messenger of Allah, or it is possible that what was known in order at that time was Hizb al-Mufassal specifically, which is not the case with the rest.”

                Salam,
I just recently had my Nikkah this past June. But the actual Rukhsati (giving away of the bride) will not take place until March because my husband is studying in a different state.
When he comes and visits my parents get very upset if I spend too much time with him. They say it is inappropriate. They are constantly watching what we do. They get upset if I go out with him and come home late. My question is, What does Islam have to say about parent's interfering in their child's marriage? I respect my parents but yet they do not seem to repect my privacy? Am I being unreasonable? Any information that you can give on this matter will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",,"Praise be to Allah.If a man has completed the marriage contract (aqd nikaah) with a woman according to Islamic law, everything is permissible for him, he may look at her, be alone with her, enjoy physical contact with her, and so on, but his wife is not obliged to obey him and he is not obliged to spend on her until she submits herself to him, which according to the customs of most people nowadays happens after the waleemah or wedding party. Some mothers and fathers do not like their daughter to be alone with her husband between the aqd (nikaah) and waleemah because they are afraid of some problem arising that may cause the break up of the marriage, and their daughter may then no longer be a virgin, or she may become pregnant, and if the waleemah is delayed her pregnancy will be obvious to people, or other situations which may cause embarrassment to the parents. Parents may have concerns of which their children may not be aware, and which a daughter may not see as important because she is so excited and happy about her new husband. Although it is permissible for the couple to enjoy physical contact after the nikaah is completed even before the waleemah they should respect their parents wishes and pay attention to their concerns. The husband should also understand their concerns and should remain content with family visits until things settle down, i.e., after the waleemah. We ask Allaah to hasten for you the good things that you want. And Allaah is the Source of help."

You must follow the Sunnah and call on Allah by His names and attributes, as he says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them…” [al-A’raaf 7:180]. As regards Soorat al-Faatihah, it is the greatest soorah of the Quran, so recite it whenever you wish, without specifying a certain number of times or a certain way of reciting it that has no basis in Islam.

I have a Question to ask concerning Jesus (peace be upon him). Did Jesus (peace be upon him) ascend twice to Allah? I have read in some books that it mentions Jesus (peace be upon him) ascending to the skies and then later being brought down to comfort his mother and telling the Jews of something and then leaving. Is this true?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, tells us that Jesus (upon whom be peace) was raised up to heaven just one time, in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“But Allah raised him up (with his body and soul) unto Himself…” [Al-Nisa’ 4:158] and Allah does not tell us that Jesus was sent back to this earth. So those who claim that Jesus was sent back to this earth have to bring us evidence and proof. If they cannot do that – and they will never be able to do it – then their argument has no basis.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allah said: ‘O Eesa (Jesus)! I will take you and raise you to Myself and clear you [of the forged statement that `Isa (Jesus) is Allah’s son] of those who disbelieve, and I will make those who follow you (monotheists, who worship none but Allah) superior to those who disbelieve [in the oneness of Allah, or disbelieve in some of His Messengers, or in His Holy Books] till the Day of Resurrection. Then you will return to Me and I will judge between you in the matters in which you used to dispute.”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:55]
Ibn Jareer, may Allah have mercy on him, explained that the word “mutawaffeeka”
[which usually refers to death and is translated here as “raise” – Translator] refers to his being taken up, but most of the scholars said that the meaning here is sleep, as Allah says elsewhere in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is He, Who takes your souls [yatawaffaakum] by night (when you are asleep)…”[al-An’aam 6:60]
“It is Allah Who takes away [yatawaffaa] the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep…”[Al-Zumar 39:42]
When he got up from sleeping, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say, “Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi ahyaanaa ba’da maa amaatanaa wa ilayh il-nushoor (Praise be to Allah Who has brought us back to life after causing us to die, and unto Him is the resurrection).”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6312; Muslim, 2711)
Allah’s statement that He raised Jesus up to heaven is also a refutation of the Jews’ claim to have killed him. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the aayat (signs) of Allah, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying, ‘Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e., we do not understand what the Messengers say)’ – nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little.
And because of their (Jews’) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she had committed illegal sexual intercourse);
And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allah’ – but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of `Isa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e., `Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary)].
But Allah raised him [`Isa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.
And there is none of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him [`Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being], before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he [`Isa (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.”[al-Nisa’ 4:155-159]
Jesus (peace be upon him) has not died yet; Allah raised him up unto Himself because the Jews wanted to kill him, and he will descend again at the end of time and rule the earth according to Islam. He will live for as long as Allah wants him to, then he will die and the Muslims will pray [the janaazah or funeral prayer] for him. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The pronoun in the phrase before his death refers to Jesus (peace be upon him), i.e., there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in Jesus – that is when he comes back down to the earth before the Day of Resurrection, as we will explain below. At that time all of the People of the Book will believe in him because he will abolish the jizyah (tax paid by non-Muslims in an Islamic state) and will accept nothing but Islam…
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning)
“and [I will] clear you of those who disbelieve” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:55] means “by raising you up to heaven” and “I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection” is what did indeed happen. When Allah took the Messiah (peace be upon him) up into heaven, his followers split into different groups. Some of them believed in what Allah had sent him with, that he was a slave and messenger of Allah, the son of His female slave. Some of them exaggerated about him and made him the son of God, and others said that he was God, or that he was the third of three (trinity). Allah described what they said in the Quran, and refuted all of them. They continued like that for nearly three hundred years, then one of the Greek kings called Constantine came along and entered the Christian religion. It was said that this was a plot to corrupt the religion, that he was a philosopher, or that he was ignorant. Whatever the case, he changed and distorted the religion of the Messiah, adding things and taking things away. It was at the time of Constantine that pork was permitted and they began to pray towards the East; they made images in their churches, shrines and monasteries, and added ten days to their fasting because of a sin that he had committed, as they claim. The religion of the Messiah became the religion of Constantine. He built more than twelve thousand churches, shrines and monasteries for them, and the city that bore his name [Constantinople – now Istanbul]. A sect of Christians followed him and they prevailed over the Jews with the help of Allah, because they were closer to the truth, even though all of them were disbelievers. When Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), some of those who believed in him believed truly in Allah, His angels, His Books and His Messengers, so they were followers of every Prophet who had ever lived on earth.

      it comes to women and I don't know what to do. I pray 5 times a day, and I fast, and I try
      to be good but when it comes to women I can't control myself. Thank you for your help.
      Salam",,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the
    truth when he said, I am not leaving behind any fitnah (trial, temptation) more
    harmful to men than women. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4706).
    He 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also
    said: This world is sweet and dazzling, and Allaah has you put in charge of it to
    see how you will do and what you will do, so beware of this world and beware of women, for
    the first fitnah (temptation, trial) that befell the Children of Israel was concerning
    women. (Reported by Muslim, 4925).
    You have to deal with two things, one now and one in the
    future. As far as your past misbehaviour is concerned, you must repent sincerely to Allaah
    right now, and do good deeds to expiate for your bad deeds, as was reported in the hadeeth
    of Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that a man kissed a woman
    [who was unlawful for him]; he came to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) and told him about it, [saying, I met a woman in the garden, and I
    embraced her, touched her and kissed her]. [Here I am, judge concerning me as you
    wish.] [He started asking how he could expiate for this, and (the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) did not say anything]. Then Allaah revealed
    the words (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends
    of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil
    deeds [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, O Messenger of Allaah, is this
    just for me? He said, It is for all of my ummah (reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 495; additional material in brackets is from the reports of al-Tirmidhi,
    Ahmad, Muslim and Ibn Maajah, in that order), so do a lot of acts of
    worship and good deeds, so that Allaah may accept your repentance. 
    As far as the future is concerned, you are not permitted at all to go
    to places where there is corruption and free mixing, where you are likely to meet women.
    You say that you cannot control yourself, so why do you go to places where you spend time
    chatting informally with women, and then say that you cannot resist? What you say is
    completely unacceptable. If you avoid the places and things that lead to evil, and do not
    expose yourself to it, you will protect yourself from falling into sin. Fear Allaah, for
    Allaah is watching you to see how you will do and what you will do. Beware of going to
    places that will lead you into haraam things. Remember that the more you indulge in haraam
    activities, the more difficult it is to retreat, so nip it in the bud. Stick to righteous
    company, and keep away from evil things and evil people. Do everything that will help you
    to remain chaste, such as hastening to marry and lowering your gaze. I ask Allaah to
    protect you from the temptation of women. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

Is it permissible to give charity to non-Muslims if they are in urgent need? Will the person who gives such charity be rewarded?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to give charity to non-Muslims and this action will be rewarded, if they are in need of it, but they should not be given the obligatory charity, i.e. zakat, unless they are those whose hearts are to be softened (i.e., they are close to embracing Islam). It is a condition for giving charity to non-Muslims that they should not be involvied in fighting the Muslims or driving them from their homes, because charity in such cases would be seen as helping them to wage war against the Muslims.
(Fataawa Mutanawwi’ah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 521).
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity. It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the zaalimoon (wrong-doers – those who disobey Allah.)” [al-Mumtahimah 60:8-9].
Muslims should seek first and foremost to give their charity to their Muslim brothers who are in need, and there are plenty of them. And Allah knows best."

The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that the Hajj would be counted for the boy, and that his mother would be rewarded for taking him on Hajj.
Similarly, people other than the parents may also be rewarded for good deeds, such as teaching those under their care such as orphans, relatives, servants and other people, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever guides others to do good will have a reward similar to that of the one who does it …” (reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 3509), and because this is a form of co-operating in righteousness and piety, which Allaah urges us to do."

“Making images of animate beings is haraam and earnings from doing
    this are haraam.”
When Allaah forbids a thing, He also forbids its price. Making images
    of animate beings is forbidden, as it was reported in the saheeh evidence. Therefore
    earnings from doing this are unclean and it is not permissible to consume them. An
    exception is made in the case of images that are necessary, such as photos for ID
    documents and photos used to track down criminals and so on. It is permissible to make
    these images and receive payment for doing so. The one who is asking this question could

      please tell me when saying Takbir after the Imam says Takbir in Salat if it those
      following the Imam should say it out loud or to ones self?",,"Praise be to Allah.The imaam should say the Takbeerat al-Ihraam (first Takbeer) and
    the Takbeeraat for the movements of the prayer aloud, so that the people behind him can
    hear him and follow him. If the mosque is big and the imaam’s voice cannot reach all
    the people who are praying, or his voice is weak because of sickness etc. or because that
    is his nature, some of the people praying behind him can convey the Takbeeraat [by
    repeating them aloud], because of the saheeh hadeeth which says that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led the people in prayer when he was sick, and
    Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) made the people hear the Takbeer. (Agreed upon).
With regard to the person who is praying behind the imaam, the
    Sunnah is for him to say the Takbeer quietly so that only he himself can hear it. This
    also applies to his recitation of Qur’aan, Takbeeraat, saying Tasbeeh in Rukoo’

If a woman misses several years of fasting the month of Ramdan due to pregnancy and breastfeeding is she obligated to make these up by fasting each day? Is there another option that she may take such as feeding the poor because it would be very difficult for her to make up so many days? Some women are pregnant or breastfeeding for many years in a row without an opportunity to make them up. Also, does she need to make these up before she can do voluntary fasting such as during the month of Shawwal? If this is the case, then it may be difficult for her to gain the rewards of fasting during this month since she would need to make up the missed days first ? Is the opportunity to make up days lost after a certain time period ? For example, if the woman had not made them up before the next Ramadan is the opportunity lost ?",,"Praise be to Allah.A Muslim woman who misses any fasts in Ramadan because of being pregnant or breastfeeding must make them up after she no longer has that excuse, just like the sick person of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days…” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
A woman may space out these days (i.e., she does not have to fast them all at once, consecutively), as this is easier for her. (See also ""Seventy Questions About Fasting "").
It is better to make up missed days before the next Ramadan comes, but if the excuse is still present, she may delay making them up until she is able to do so. She should not resort to feeding poor people (instead of fasting) unless she is totally unable to fast.

                I very doubtfull about the fact that many
      muslims say that if a christian or a jew give you meat to eat, we must say basmala to make
      it halal. But the islam teaches us that what is haraam is still haraam, even there is a
      good intention (i.e. to say basmala)",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars agree unanimously that it is permissible to
    eat the meat of the People of the Book, Jews and Christians, if the name of Allaah is
    mentioned at the time of slaughter, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Eat
    not of that (meat) on which Allaah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of
    slaughtering of the animal)…” [al-An’aam 6:121]. If the person
    mentioned a name other than that of Allaah, such as the name of ‘Uzayr or of the
    Messiah, then it is not permissible to eat of it, because of the general meaning of the
    aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you… that which is
    slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah.” [al-Baqarah 2:173]. 
It is also a condition that the meat should be slaughtered in the
    manner prescribed by sharee’ah. If it is known that the slaughter was not done in the
    proper Islamic manner, e.g., by strangulation or electric shock and so on, then it is
    haraam.
As for the claim that some make, that it is enough merely to mention
    the name of Allaah when eating, this was reported regarding some Muslims who were new in
    Islam. The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about this, saying, “O Messenger of Allaah, some
    people who are new in Islam brought us some meat, and we do not know whether they
    mentioned the name of Allaah over it or not.” The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Say the name of Allaah over it and eat it.” (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari). The command should be understood as meaning that one
    should be on the safe side, provided that one does not know beforehand that the meat is
    not slaughtered properly. And Allaah knows best."

      he carry on reading next to the imam?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a third person comes and joins two who are praying,
    then the one who is praying behind the imaam should move back, because of the report
    narrated by Muslim, in al-Saheeh (no. 3010), from Jaabir who said: “The
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up to pray, and I
    came and stood on his left. He took my hand and turned me around until I was standing on
    his right. Then Jabbaar ibn Sakhr came and stood on the left of the Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He took both our hands and pushed us back
    until we were standing behind him. 
The scholars mentioned that if there is space in front of the imaam and
    no space behind the two people who are praying behind him, the imaam should move forward,
    but if there is space behind them and no space in front of the imaam, then they should
    move back. If there is space both in front of the imaam and behind the two people, the two
    people should move back and the imaam should not move forward, because he is to be
    followed and should not move, and because the imaam should pray with a barrier in front of
    him such as a wall or pillar, etc.
Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’,
    4/292:
“If there is an imaam and two people praying behind him, the imaam
    should come forward and they should stand behind him, whether they are two men or two boys
    or a man and a boy… Then if there is space in front of the imaam and not behind the
    two people praying behind him, he should move forward or they should move back. As to
    which is preferable, there are two opinions. The correct view is that stated by Shaykh Abu
    Haamid and the majority, which is that they should move back because the imaam is to be
    followed and should not move.
… this is if the second person joins the prayer during the qiyaam
    (standing). But if he comes during the tashahhud or sujood, nobody should move forward or
    move back until they stand up again. There is no dispute that this moving forward or back
    should not occur until after the second person has said the takbeer for starting the
    prayer, as they mentioned. And Allaah knows best.”"

    you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-taqwa (i.e., is one of the muttaqoon –
    the pious). Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.” [al-Hujuraat 49:13]
In His wisdom, Allaah has made mankind into different peoples and tribes
    so that they may know one another, not so that they may despise one another. He tells us
    that the differences in colour and languages are a sign of His greatness and power in
    creation. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth
    and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily, in that are indeed signs for men

The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad

    When a man insulted his brother (in Islam) for having a
    black mother, the Prophet

Hijaamah comes from the root al-hajm, which means “sucking”, and is used of the action of draining the breast when an infant is suckled.

Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best times to be treated with cupping are the seventeenth, nineteenth or twenty-first [of the month].” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2054; the isnaad is da’eef)
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever wants to be treated by cupping, let him do it on the seventeenth, nineteenth or twenty-first, lest the blood flow too copiously and kill him.” (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 3489; there is some weakness in the report)
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever is treated with cupping on the seventeenth, nineteenth or twenty first, will be healed from all diseases.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3861, and al-Bayhaqi, 9/340. The isnad is hasan)
Although the ahaadeeth quoted above are from different sources and may be weak to some extent, they give strength to one another.
Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“These ahaadeeth coincide with what the doctors agree on, that cupping should be done in the second half of the month, and that the third quarter of the month is better than the beginning or the end. But if cupping is done out of necessity it is beneficial at any time, even at the beginning or end of the month. Al-Khallaal said: ‘Ismah ibn ‘Isaam told me: Hanbal told me: Abu ‘Abd-Allaah Ahmad ibn Hanbal would be treated with cupping whenever his blood increased, no matter what time it was… They disliked having cupping done on a full stomach, because that could lead to obstruction and grievous diseases, especially if the food was heavy and bad… Choosing the times mentioned above for cupping is an extra precaution, to be on the safe side and to protect one’s health, but when it comes to treating disease, whenever it is necessary it should be used.”
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“According to the doctors, the most efficacious cupping is that which is done at the second or third hour, after having intercourse or taking a bath, etc., and neither on a full nor empty stomach. With regard to specific days for administering cupping, it was reported in a hadeeth narrated from Ibn ‘Umar by Ibn Maajah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Administer cupping, may Allaah bless you, on Thursdays, and administer cupping on Mondays and Tuesdays, but avoid cupping on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.’ It was reported with two da’eef isnads, and there is a third version, also da’eef, reported by al-Daaraqutni in al-Afraad. He also reported it with a jayyid isnaad from Ibn ‘Umar but it is mawqoof (the isnad stops at the Sahaabi). Al-Khallaal reported that Ahmad disliked cupping on the days mentioned, even though the hadeeth was not proven. It was said that a man was treated with cupping on a Wednesday and he developed leprosy because he ignored the hadeeth. Abu Dawood reported from Abu Bakrah that he disliked cupping on Tuesdays, and said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Tuesday is the day of blood, and on that day there is an hour when blood does not stop.’ The doctors are agreed that cupping in the second half of the month, especially in the third quarter, is more beneficial than cupping at the beginning or end of the month. Al-Muwaffaq al-Baghdaadi said: The body fluids (humours) flow heavily at the beginning of the month and calm down at the end, so the best time to let the blood flow is in the middle of the month.”
It is clear from the above that the ahaadeeth which specify a particular time, when taken as a whole, indicate that there is a basis for this, especially since the words of the doctors are in agreement with it. If the seventeenth or nineteenth or twenty-first of a hijri month happens to be a Thursday, this is the best possible time for cupping, but this is not to say that it is not good to do it at other times. As a form of medical treatment, cupping should not be restricted to any particular time; it should be done as needed by the patient.
It is essential to make sure that you do it properly; cupping should be done by one who is experienced and he or she should use instruments that are properly cleaned and sterilized. The cupper must also ensure that no blood reaches the stomach of the patient.
We ask Allaah to help us and you to follow the Sunnah. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

                Could you tell me as to how should a
      follower stand (right next ot slightly behind) with the Imaam, if they are only two
      praying in Jama'a?",,"Praise be to Allah.He should stand in line with the imaam, not in front of him or behind
    him, but perfectly in line with him, on his right. This is how Abd-Allaah ibn
    Abbâs stood when he prayed with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him). In his Saheeh, al-Bukhaari entitled a chapter Baab yaqoomu
    an yameenihi al-Imaam bi hidhaaihi sawaa: idha kaanaa ithnayn (Chapter:
    he should stand on the right of the imaam in line with him if they are two). In this
    chapter he mentioned the hadeeth of Abdullah ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased
    with him) who said: I stayed overnight in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah,
    and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed
    Isha, then he came and prayed four rakahs, then he slept, then he got up
    and I came and stood on his left, but he put me on his right and prayed five rakahs,
    then two rakahs, then he fell asleep and I heard his snoring. Then he went out for
    the prayer.
Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) also said: I
    came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at the
    end of the night and prayed behind him. He pulled me until I was in line with him, and
    when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned back
    to his prayer, I went back to my original position behind him. The Messenger of Allaah
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed, and when he had finished his
    prayer he said to me, What is going on? I made you stand in line with me and you
    moved back. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, is it right for anyone to pray
    alongside you when you are the Messenger of Allaah whom Allaah has blessed? He liked
    what I said and prayed that Allaah would increase me in knowledge and understanding.
    The hadeeth was narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 1/330 and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.
    Its isnaad is in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 6060.
Then al-Albaani said: From this hadeeth we may understand that
    the Sunnah is when one man is praying alone following the imaam, he should stand alongside
    him on his right, not in front of him or behind him. This is the madhhab of the Hanbalis,
    as stated in Manaar al-Sabeel, 1/128. 
Abd al-Razzaaq narrated that Ibn Jurayj said: I said to
    Ata: If a man prays with another man, where should he stand in relation
    to him? He said, To his right. I said, Should he be precisely in
    line with him so that neither is in front of the other? He said, Yes. I
    said, Do you prefer that they should stand close together so that there is no gap
    between them? He said, Yes.
In al-Muwatta it is narrated that Abd-Allaah ibn
    Utbah ibn Masood said: I entered upon Umar ibn al-Khattaab at
    midday and found him saying Tasbeeh (in the prayer). I stood behind him and he made
    me come closer until I was standing in line with him on his right. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (2/191): Some of them narrated
    that there was scholarly consensus that one person praying alone with the imaam should
    stand to the right of the imaam.

I know that a person is not accounted for his sins before the age of puberty, what about his good deeds, does he get rewarded for them?",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, children will be rewarded for doing good deeds, because of the hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1335) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: “A woman lifted up a child and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, will his Hajj (pilgrimage) be counted?’ He said, ‘Yes, and you will be rewarded.’” The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel fi Sharh Mukhtasar Shaykh al-Khaleel said, regarding the matter of children being instructed to pray when they reach the age of seven: “Al-Qaraafi said in al-Yawaaqeet fi’l-Mawaaqeet: children will earn reward for good deeds that they do because of the hadeeth (prophetic narration) of the Khath’ami woman [who lifted up her child and asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about his Hajj].”
Ibn Rushd said: “The bad deeds of young children are not recorded but their good deeds will be recorded, according to the sound opinion.”
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed, commenting on the first hadeeth quoted therein, which is the hadeeth of the Khath’ami woman: “… Abu’l-‘Aaliyah al-Riyaahi said: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: the young child’s good deeds will be recorded but his bad deeds will not be recorded.”
The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel said, concerning children entering ihraam (sacred state) for Hajj and ‘Umrah:
“The scholars do not differ concerning the fact that children will be rewarded for whatever acts of obedience (to Allaah) they do, and will be let off for any bad deeds that they do, and any bad deeds they do deliberately will be counted as mistakes. It says in Mukhtasar al-Waadihah: ‘Hajj is not an obligation for boys and girls until boys reach puberty and girls begin menstruating, but there is nothing wrong with taking them for Hajj. It is recommended (mustahabb), and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did so.’”
Then he reported that Talhah ibn Musarrif said: “It was one of the customs of the Muslims to take their children for Hajj and expose them to the mercy of Allaah.”
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed that it is encouraged to take children for Hajj, and that the majority of scholars say this. He also said: “It is nothing strange that a child should earn reward and status in the Hereafter for his salaah (prayers), zakaah (paying poor-due), Hajj and other good deeds if he does them as they should be done, (because this is) grace and mercy from Allaah, just as Allaah shows mercy to the dead by rewarding them for acts of charity done on their behalf by the living. Do you not see that they (the scholars) are agreed that a child should be commanded to pray when he reaches the age of understanding and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led Anas and the orphan in prayer? Most of the salaf (pious predecessors) said that zakaah has to be paid on the property of orphans, and it is impossible that they would not be rewarded for that. Their guardians and the one who does this on their behalf will also certainly be rewarded, as will the one who takes them for Hajj, as a blessing and mercy from Allaah. It was reported that ‘Umar said: ‘Children’s good deeds will be recorded and their bad deeds will not be recorded.’ I do not know of anyone whose opinion is worth following who said anything to the contrary.”
According to al-Ikmaal, many of the scholars said: “Children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience (to Allaah), and their good deeds will be recorded, but not their bad deeds.”
It says in Awaa’il al-Muqaddimaat: “The correct opinion in my view is that they are both encouraged to do that and will both be rewarded for it (i.e., the child and his or her guardian). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the woman [who asked about the child’s Hajj]: ‘… and you will be rewarded.’ And Allaah knows best.”
Ibn Jamaa’ah said: “According to the four (imams/leading scholars), children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience and their good deeds will be recorded, whether they are mature or not. This was reported from ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him. Some scholars report that there was consensus (ijmaa’) in this matter. It is also indicated by what we have already said under the heading of Virtues (fadaa’il), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The jihaad (physival battle) of the very old and the very young is Hajj and ‘Umrah,’ as well as the hadeeth about the woman who lifted up a child.”

      barakatuhI prayed in congregation with the intention of making maghrib prayer;
      however, the congregation was praying the ishaa prayer because the imaam combined the two
      prayers. I didn't realise this until everyone stood for the forth rakat. How should I have
      corrected my salat ?  Jazzakallahu Khayrun",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person joins the imaam whilst he is praying
    Ishaa, but he has missed Maghrib for some legitimate reason, such as
    travelling, etc., then he should pray Maghrib even if the imaam is praying
    Ishaa, because the prayers have to be kept in the proper order. This is what
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did during the campaign of
    al-Khandaq. Jaabir ibn Abd-Allaah said: Umar came on the day of al-Khandaq
    cursing the kuffaar of Quraysh and saying, O Messenger of Allaah, I did not pray
    Asr until the sun was almost setting. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said, By Allaah, I have not prayed it yet either. So he
    went down to But-haan [the name of a valley], did wudoo and prayed Asr after
    the sun had set, then he prayed Maghrib. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 893)
    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath: This
    hadeeth teaches us how to make up missed prayers in order, and most scholars agree that
    this [keeping prayers in order] is obligatory.
Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled Baab
    Qada al-Salawaat al-Oolaa fal-Oolaa (Chapter on making up prayers in
    order).
In the case mentioned in the question, it is permissible for you to
    pray Maghrib behind an imaam who is praying Ishaa, but when he gets up for the
    fourth rakah, you should remain sitting and recite the Tashahhud, and it is better
    to wait until he sits and says the Tasleem, so that you say the Tasleem with him. Then you
    should go ahead and pray Ishaa. And Allaah knows best."
959,3285,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3285,Ruling on appointing women to positions of high    public office,"Question

Is it legal islamicly to acknowledge females as our leader?",,"Praise be to Allah.Positions of leadership and high public office means taking on the mission of establishing Islam by reviving religious knowledge and establishing its foundations, engaging in jihad for the sake of Allah – which includes preparing armies and distributing war booty – establishing the judicial system, carrying out judicial punishments (hudud), fighting oppression, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, acting as a deputy of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
There is no dispute among the scholars that one of the conditions of the imam or leader is that he should be male. Ibn Hazam reported in his book Maratib al-Ijma’ that there was scholarly consensus on this point. In the section he says: “Out of all groups of the people of the Qiblah [i.e., all Muslim sects], there is not one that allows the leadership of women.” Al-Qurtubi reported something similar, and al-‘Allamah al-Shanqiti said, “There is no difference of opinion among the scholars on this point.”
The evidence for this is the general meaning of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other…” [al-Nisa 4:34]. It is also clearly indicated by the hadith of Abu Bakrah who said that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard that the Persians had appointed the daughter of Chosroes as their queen, he said, “No people who appoint a woman as their leader will ever prosper.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 13/53).
This is because positions of leadership and government require a person to join men’s gatherings, which is not allowed for women according to shari’ah because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance…” [al-Ahzab 33:33]. These positions also require perfect wisdom, reason and alertness, and the testimony of a man has been made equal to that of two women, the reason for which Allah has explained in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her…” [al-Baqarah 2:282].
Imam al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah said:
“For this reason the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his successors (khulafa) and those who came after them never appointed a woman to be a judge or a governor of a province, as far as we know. If it were permissible, it should have happened.”
Imam al-Ghazali said:
“The position of leader (imam) could never be given to a woman even if she possessed all the qualities of perfection and self-reliance. How could a woman take the position of leader when she did not have the right to be a judge or a witness under most of the historical governments?”
Imam al-Baghawi said:
“The scholars agreed that women are not fit to be leaders or judges, because the leader needs to go out to organize jihad and take care of the Muslims’ affairs, and the judge needs to go out to judge between people, but women are ‘awrah and it is not right for them to go out. Because of their weakness, women are not able to do many things. Women are imperfect, and the positions of leaders and judge are among the most perfect of positions for which only the most perfect of men are qualified.”
Undoubtedly this is proven by reality. People know from experience that only men are fit for leadership, because women by nature are more emotional and more easily swayed by their feelings and compassion. These qualities have been created in women to enable them to carry out their most important duty, which is that of motherhood and nurturing children. Men, on the other hand, are not usually swayed by their emotions as women are. Their way is usually one of logic and deliberation, which form the essence of responsibility and leadership.
With regard to the question of whether a woman may be appointed as a judge, the majority of Maliki, Shafi’i and Hanbali scholars say that a woman cannot be appointed as a judge, because of the general meaning of the hadith of Abu Bakrah quoted above.
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said:
“Ibn al-Tin said: Those who say that a woman cannot be appointed as a judge use the hadith of Abu Bakrah as evidence, and this is the view of the majority.”
With regard to other administrative positions, there is no shar’i reason why women should not be appointed to run institutions where they will work with other women and not men, because in this case there are no shar’i reservations about their work.
There is no validity in what most modern writers say about how women have to go out and take part in parliaments and public councils, and that these are part of the rights granted to women by Islam. These writers have not examined the issue from the correct Islamic viewpoint. The truth is clear, but unfortunately they look at it with minds filled with the heretic trends of East and West. Therefore you see them weakened and defeated, dazzled by the false civilizations of those nations, then they come and misinterpret the texts and change the words from their right places until they agree with their whims. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound."

                I live in the west. I study during the day; this is why I searched for a job to do during the night out of need; as my father does not have the ability to pay for my study. I am the only muslim working in the kitchen of this elderly home. I have to cook pork and pour wine into cups. What is the ruling on my work, bearing in mind that I looked for work in other places but they refused to hire me because I wear hejab?.",,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Allaah has prescribed rulings in Islam that are based on 
    wisdom. The rulings are aimed at setting individuals and societies straight. 
    The one who goes against these rulings exposes himself to punishment in the 
    Hereafter and he may be punished in this world before that. 

    We are not going to discuss the greatness of Allaah’s wisdom 
    in His laws, rather we have to introduce our answer in this way because of 
    the sister’s question, asking for the ruling on her studies or her work. She 
    is living among the kuffaar, in their country, and they are causing trouble 
    for her because of her religious commitment. How much pressure is this 
    Muslim woman and many others like her living with? When will fathers and 
    mothers pay attention and wake up from their heedlessness, and leave those 
    lands which have caused many to lose their religion and identity? You will 
    find that there are many wise people who regret paying too much attention to 
    accumulating money at the expense of their religion and honour.  

    Secondly: 

    Staying in kaafir countries is haraam for the one who is 
    unable to practice his religion openly or who is afraid that he may be led 
    astray from his religion. See the answers to questions no.
    27211,
    14235 and
    3225. 

    Thirdly: 

    Your studying in that country is undoubtedly in a mixed 
    environment, and there is no doubt that you are seeing sins and immorality 
    in those places, which pains the heart of the chaste Muslim. If studying in 
    a Muslim country is in a mixed environment it is not permissible, so how can 
    it be permissible in a kaafir country? 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas 
    said: 

    For a woman to study shar’i knowledge and other fields which 
    a woman needs to know or which will help her to know matters of her religion 
    is something that is prescribed, so long as it will not result in anything 
    that is not allowed in sharee’ah. But if it will result in something that is 
    forbidden in sharee’ah, such as mixing with non-mahram men or not observing 
    hijab, then it is not permissible, because these are haraam things, and 
    because that will lead to corruption. End quote.

    They also said:  

    Mixing between men and women in schools and elsewhere is a 
    great evil and leads to great corruption in religious and worldly terms. It 
    is not permissible for a woman to study or work in a place where men and 
    women mix, and it is not permissible for her guardian to allow her to do so.

    (12/156) 

    Fourthly: 

    Your working in the seniors’ home is also haraam, because it 
    involves mixing with men; and because it involves making food using pork, 
    which Allaah has stated is haraam, and it is also haraam according to the 
    Sunnah and scholarly consensus; and because it involves serving wine which 
    is also haraam according to the Qur’aan, Sunnah and scholarly consensus. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

    It is not permissible for a woman to work with men who are 
    not her mahrams, because of the evils that result from her presence with 
    them. She has to seek provision through ways that do not involve anything 
    haraam. If a person fears Allaah, He will make things easy for him. The 
    Committee has issued a fatwa concerning that, the text of which is as 
    follows: 

    As for the mixing of women with men in factories and offices, 
    in non-Muslim countries, it is not permissible. But they have something that 
    is worse than that, which is disbelief in Allaah, so it is no surprise that 
    such evils occur among them. As for women mixing with men in Muslim 
    countries, at the time when they are Muslim, that is also haraam. The 
    authorities in the places where this mixing occurs must take steps to put 
    the women in one place and the men in another, because of the moral 
    corruption that results from mixing, as is obvious to anyone who has the 
    slightest insight. End quote.

    him) said: There is no vow for the son of Adam with regard to that which he does not
    possess; there is no setting free of (a slave) whom he does not possess; there is no
    divorce of (a wife) whom he does not possess. (Reported by
    al-Tirmidhi, who said: a saheeh hasan hadeeth).
    The hadeeth of Abd-Allaah ibn Amr (may Allaah be pleased with
    him), who reported that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: No divorce except of (the wife) whom you possess; no setting free
    except of (the slave) whom you possess, and no selling except of (the goods) that you
    possess. (Reported by Abu Dawood; it is a hasan hadeeth).
    The hadeeth of Ibn Makhramah from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), who said, No divorce before marriage, and no setting free
    before taking possession. (Reported by Ibn Maajah; it is a hasan hadeeth).
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Abu Ubayd
    reported that Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) was asked about a man who said,
    If I marry so-and-so, then she is divorced (straightaway). Ali said:
    There is no divorce except after taking possession.
It was also reported that Ali said: There is no divorce except
    after marriage even if he mentioned (the woman) by name.
This is the opinion of Aaishah, and also of al-Shaafai,
    Ahmad and Ishaaq and their companions, and of Dawood and his companions, and of the
    majority of hadeeth scholars.
Among the evidence to support this opinion is the fact that when a man
    says, If I marry so-and-so then she is divorced, at the time when this
    suspended divorce is uttered, the woman is still ajnabiyyah (literally, a
    stranger, not his wife or mahram) to him, and the thing that comes later [i.e.,
    marriage] takes precedence over whatever went before [i.e., the vow of divorce]. Nikaah
    (marriage) cannot be divorce. Similarly, if he said to a woman to whom he is not married
    yet, If you enter the house you will be divorced, then she entered the house
    after she became his wife, then she is not divorced. There is no dispute (among the
    scholars).

962,3297,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3297,Tawassul: Islamic vs. Bid`ah,"Question

I have a question regarding tawassul. I was telling someone that seeking tawassul at graves and asking the person who died to make du’a to Allah is wrong. He told me what is wrong with asking a pious person during his life to make Du’a and when he died I asked him to make du’a?
 So I want you to clarify to me how to answer the brother. What kind of tawassul is allowed and which one is not allowed since a lot of people have been misguided in this area?","Tawassul in Arabic means seeking to draw close. There are two types of Tawassul; correct Islamic tawassul and forbidden tawassul. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.What is tawassul?
Tawassul in Arabic means seeking to draw close. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): [they] desire means of access to their Lord [al-Isra 17:57], i.e., means of drawing close to Him. 
Types of tawassul 
There are two types of Tawassul ; correct Islamic tawassul and forbidden tawassul.
Correct Islamic tawassul
This means seeking to draw close to Allah through acts of worship which He loves and which please Him; these may be obligatory or encouraged, and may take the form of words, actions or beliefs. Some types are as follows:
1.      Seeking to draw close to Allah by means of His names and attributes. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His names. They will be requited for what they used to do.” [al-A'raf 7:180]
 
So when a person makes du’a to Allah, he begins by calling on Allah with the name that is most apt, such as al-Rahman (the Most Merciful) when seeking mercy and al-Ghafur (the All-Forgiving) when asking for forgiveness, and so on.
1.     Seeking to draw close to Allah by means of faith and Tawhid. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger, so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth).” [Al ‘Imran 3:53]
1.     Seeking to draw close to Allah through righteous deeds, whereby a person asks Allah by virtue of the best deeds that he has done, such as salah, fasting, reading Quran, avoiding haram things, and so on. An example of this is the sahih hadith narrated in the Sahihayn about the three people who entered a cave, and a rock fell and blocked their way out. They asked Allah by virtue of their best deeds (to save them).
 
A person may also ask Allah by virtue of his total dependency upon Him, as Allah mentions in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): “[Ayyub said:] Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.” [al-Anbiya 21:83]; or by admitting his own wrongdoing and his need for Allah, as Yunus is described as saying (interpretation of the meaning): “None has the right to be worshipped except You (O Allah). Glorified (and exalted) are You. Truly I have been of the wrong-doers.” [al-Anbiya 21:87]
Ruling on tawassul 
The rulings on Islamically correct tawassul vary according to its type. Some types are wajib, such as seeking to draw close to Allah through His names and attributes and through Tawhid (believing in His absolute Oneness), and some are mustahabb, such as seeking to draw close to Him by virtue of all kinds of righteous deeds.
Tawassul that is bidah and forbidden
This is the attempt to draw close to Allah by means of things that He does not like and that do not please Him, whether they be words, deeds or beliefs. One example of this is trying to draw close to Allah by calling on the dead or people who are absent, asking them for help, and so on. This is a form of major shirk, which goes against Tawhid and means that a person is no longer considered to be a Muslim. 
Calling upon Allah, whether it is for a purpose such as asking Him to grant some benefit or to ward off some harm, or as an act of worship to express humility and submission before Him, can only be addressed directly to Allah. 
If du’as or prayers are addressed to anything or anyone else, this is shirk. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord said: Invoke Me (and ask Me for anything), I will respond to your invocation. Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e., do not invoke Me and do not believe in My Oneness], they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!” [Ghafir 40:60]
In this verse, Allah explains the punishment of those who arrogantly refuse to call on Allah, whether they call on someone other than Allah or they do not call on Him at all, out of pride and self-admiration, even if they do not call on anyone else.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.” [al-A'raf 7:55]. Allah commands His slaves to call on Him and not anyone else.
Allah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): “[They say:] By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error when we held you (false gods) as equals (in worship) with the Lord of the Worlds.” [al-Shu’ara 26:96-97]
Anything that results in equating something other than Allah with Allah in worship or acts of obedience is shirk, the crime of associating partners with Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him until the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind is gathered (one the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become enemies for them and will deny their worshipping.” [al-Ahqaf 46:5-6]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, al-kafirun (the disbelievers in Allah and in the Oneness of Allah) will not be successful. [al-Muminun 23:117].
Allah states that anyone who calls on anything other than him is taking that thing as a god, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a qitmir (the thin membrane over a date-stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad), like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything).” [Fatir 35:13-14].
In this verse, Allah explains that He is the only One Who deserves to be called upon, because He, and no one else, is the Sovereign Who is directing everything. Those things that are worshipped cannot hear du’as, let alone respond to the one who invokes them, and even if they were able to hear, they cannot respond, because they do not have the power to either benefit or harm.
The Arab pagans whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to call were disbelievers because of this shirk. They would call upon Allah sincerely at times of difficulty, but they became disbelievers at times of ease and plenty, when they would call on others besides Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” [al-Ankabut 29:65]
“And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah Alone). But when He brings you safely to land, you turn away (from Him).” [al-Isra 17:67]
“…till when you are in the ships and they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they are glad therein, then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are encircled therein, they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him Alone.” [Yunus 10:33]
The shirk of some people nowadays goes even further than the shirk of people in the past, because they direct some acts of worship to something other than Allah, calling upon them and asking them for help even at times of distress; la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no strength and no help except in Allah). We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.
To sum up our response to what your friend mentioned: asking the dead for anything is shirk, and asking the living for anything that no one except Allah is able to do, is also shirk.

                I am a young Christian woman and I have
      been reading about Islam for some months now. I have already read a translation of the
      Koran and several books about Islam along with articles and other material I have found on
      the internet and elsewhere. I do not pretend to know or understand everything, there are
      many things that still confuse me, and I have a hard time accepting some applications and
      interpretations of Islam that I have read about. However, I do believe in God and I do
      believe that Muhammad was his prophet and that the Koran is the revealed word of God. The question is what should I do about it? As I said there are still so
      many things that I do not know or understand and this is a major decision I am trying to
      make and to tell the truth it feels like an enormous responsibility and it is quite
      frightening. What worries me the most is that I don't know how well I could live by
      Islam if I converted. I have already changed some things in my life, I have stopped
      drinking, I avoid pork and I try to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants (or skirts)
      when I go out. But I also know that there are some things I would not be able to do
      immediately if I converted, for varios reasons, (at least that is the way it looks to me
      at this moment), such as wearing hijab. Also, I am currently studying abroad (in the US, but I am from Europe) but
      I am going home to my family over Christmas. I don't think I would be able to tell my
      family right away if I converted and thus I do not know if I could do things such as pray
      all the five daily prayers, fast or avoid pork while at home over Christmas.Would it be wrong of me converting knowing that I will not be able to
      fulfill all the obligations that follow (at least not immediately), and knowing that there
      are still many issues that I do not understand or have a hard time accepting
      wholeheartedly (due to lack of understanding and knowledge . Please guide me .",,"Praise be to Allah.What you have achieved in your quest for the truth is great indeed. All
    that remains to be done is the most important step you will ever take in your life, which
    is to pronounce the Shahaadatayn and enter Islam. We truly appreciate the great efforts
    you have made by reading the entire Quraan in translation, and other books and
    articles about Islam, and also by already giving up some haraam things such as drinking
    wine and eating pork. The most important thing that you have achieved is your conviction
    about Islam, the Prophet of Islam and the Book of Islam. From your question we can sum up
    the obstacles that you face in two points:
some social embarrassment

some matters that you do not yet fully understand

With regard to the second point, it is not a condition for becoming
    Muslim that a person should know the entire religion, because it is a vast ocean. You can
    become Muslim and then learn the religion and develop full conviction about all the
    rulings of Islam. At the beginning, it is sufficient to believe in the six pillars of
    faith in general terms (belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last
    Day and predestination, both good and bad) and to understand and accept in general terms
    the five pillars of Islam (testifying that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is
    the Messenger of Allaah, prayer, paying zakaah, fasting in Ramadaan, and performing Hajj
    to the sacred House of Allaah, for the one who is able and has the means). Realize that
    knowledge and conviction develop gradually, and that faith increases by doing acts of
    worship and obedience to Allaah, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding and
    acceptance of the rulings of Islam.
With regard to the first point, we are sure that if you enter Islam and
    are sincere towards Allaah and do righteous deeds, then Allaah will give you the strength,
    steadfastness, courage and certainty to face all difficulties and overcome them. The
    experience of other women who have become Muslim before you gives you a good example of
    what you could be able to do in the future as regards following the rules of Islam, such
    as hijaab and other issues, despite being surrounded by an overwhelming atmosphere of
    kufr. We also say that if any woman were to ask us whether she should become Muslim
    despite not wearing full hijab or stay a kaafir, we would definitely tell her to become
    Muslim, because the seriousness and danger of remaining a kaafir is far worse than being a
    Muslim but committing a sin.
We understand totally the difficulties and social embarrassment that
    you speak of, and we know that going against ones family and the society in which
    one lives are very difficult matters, but Allaah makes every difficult thing easy.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
 And Allaah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the
    believers. [Aal Imraan 3:68]
And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). [al-Talaaq 65:2]
 Allaah will grant after hardship, ease. [al-Talaaq
    65:7]
As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely
    guide them to Our Paths (i.e., Allaahs Religion  Islamic
    Monotheism) [al-Ankaboot 29:69]
We also want to tell you that it is possible for a person, if he
    becomes Muslim and fears unbearable persecution or hardship, to conceal his Islam and keep
    it a secret, hiding his acts of worship from the people around him although it is
    difficult to do so. But for the sake of following the truth and saving oneself from the
    punishment of Hellfire, everything becomes easy and the believer can overcome all
    difficulties.
Finally, we can only thank you for the efforts you have made and for
    sending this question. We hope that the next step, which you should take immediately, is
    abundantly clear to you from our answer. We will be very happy to help you with anything
    you may need in the future, and we ask Allaah to guide you to the path of truth, to help
    you and to make things easy for you. Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

Now, can she practice her religious rites in the same house and have pictures of the crucifiction of Jesus (A) and celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas and etc. Can her kids join her? If no, would not it hurt her feelings? Please, answer me on this issue.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. At the same time he should direct them towards what will benefit them, even if that affects his relationship with his wife. The aims of sharee’ah and protecting one’s religion – which is one of the most important aims of sharee’ah – take priority over everything else.
Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about a man who had a Christian wife – could he let her go out to join in the Christian festivals or to go to the church? He said, no.
In al-Mughni (1/21), Ibn Qudaamah says: “(Treatment of women): If his wife is a dhimmiyyah [a Jew or Christian living under Islamic rule], he can prevent her from going to the church, because that is not an act of obedience to Allah.”
If these scholars said that the husband should stop a Christian wife from going to church, then what do you think is the case with regard to her celebrating these innovated festivals in the house of her Muslim husband? Especially when we know the harm that results from these festivals, which is far worse than her merely going to the church.

                Is it OK to read books on Science fiction
      where a mad scientist creates a human being or a hybrid between a human and an animal?",,"Praise be to Allah.If these stories include lies, such as Darwin’s
    theory (evolution), and other things that are contrary to the facts stated by Islam and
    the facts of natural science, then the Muslim should avoid them, and keep himself busy
    with something that will be of use to him, such as learning good things or doing righteous
    deeds or reading true stories and historical accounts and so on. Many of the movies and
    novels that are known as “Science Fiction” include a lot of kufr, such as
    putting life and death in the hands of some created being, giving creatures the ability to
    create from nothing, saying that scientists in laboratories can create from nothing,
    making inanimate things come alive, creating life from a fossil that has been dead for
    many millenia, or travelling to the future then coming back to the present. All of this is
    impossible, and no one knows the unseen except for Allaah. Some of these novels and movies
    also include clear contradictions of historical facts that are mentioned in the
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, such as man’s creation and his life on earth. When the
    Muslim indulges in reading these books or watching these movies, it shakes his belief or
    at the very least wastes his time and keeps him busy with something that is of no benefit
    to him. Some people claim that this is just entertainment and a way of passing time, but
    entertainment is not permitted if it is haraam, and the Muslim’s time is too precious
    to be wasted on such trivial things. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said: “One of the signs of a person being properly committed to Islam is that he
    leaves alone that which does not concern him.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2239,

Taking part in their festivals also involves imitating the kuffaar, which is forbidden in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”
(Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad). ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say: “Avoid the enemies of Allah during their festivals.” (Reported by al-Bayhaqi).
If what is referred to is accepting an invitation to a meal, for example, and there is nothing involved that is forbidden in Islam, such as mixing of men and women, or foods forbidden by Allah such as wine and pork, or dancing and music and so on, and this participation does not imply that one loves these kuffaar, then there is nothing wrong with accepting their invitation.

                I tend to forget things that interfere with my daily activities. Can you advice me any practice according to Quran and Sunnah that might help me?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is human nature to be forgetful, as the Arab poet said:
He is only called man (insaan) because of his forgetfulness (nasiyaan), and it is only called the heart (al-qalb) because it changes so rapidly (yataqallib).
In the past they said that the first one to forget (awwal naasin) was the first man (awwal al-naas), meaning Adam, peace be upon him. Forgetfulness is something that varies from person to person according to each individuals nature; some may be more forgetful than others. Some of the things that may help to combat forgetfulness are the following:

Keeping away from sin, because the bad effects of sin result in a bad memory and the inability to retain knowledge. The darkness of sin cannot co-exist with the light of knowledge. The following words were attributed to al-Shaafa'i, may Allaah have mercy on him:

I complained to [my shaykh] Wakee about my bad memory, and he taught me that I should keep away from sin.
He said that knowledge of Allaah is light, and the light of Allaah is not given to the sinner.
Al-Khateeb reported in al-Jaami (2/387) that Yahya ibn Yahya said: A man asked Maalik ibn Anas, O Abu Abd-Allaah! Is there anything that will improve my memory? He said, If anything will improve it, it is giving up sin.
When a person commits a sin, it overwhelms him and this leads to anxiety and sorrow which keeps him busy thinking about what he has done. This dulls his senses and distracts him from many beneficial things, including seeking knowledge.
Frequently remembering Allaah, may He be glorified, by reciting dhikr, tasbeeh (saying Subhan Allaah), tahmeed (Al-hamdu Lillaah), tahleel (Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah) and takbeer (Allaahu akbar), etc. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And remember your Lord when you forget [al-Kahf 18:24] Not eating too much, because eating too much makes one sleep too much and become lazy, and it dulls the senses, besides exposing one to the risk of physical diseases. Most of the diseases which we see result from food and drink. Some of the scholars have mentioned certain foods which increase the memory, such as drinking honey and eating raisins and chewing certain kinds of gum resin.
Imaam al-Zuhri said: You should eat honey because it is good for the memory.
He also said: Whoever wants to memorize hadeeth should eat raisins. (From al-Jaami by al-Khateeb, 2/394).
Ibraaheem ibn [sth. omitted] said, You should chew resin gum, because it gives energy to the heart and gets rid of forgetfulness. (From al-Jaami by al-Khateeb, 2/397).
As they mentioned, too much acidic food is one of the causes of laziness and weak memory.
Another thing that can help the memory and reduce forgetfulness is cupping (hijaamah) of the head, as is well known from experience. (For more information see Al-Tibb al-Nabawi by Ibn al-Qayyim). And Allaah knows best."

    percent referred to in the question is like voluntary charity (sadaqah), and
    sadaqah does not replace zakaat, because zakaat is an obligatory act of worship which must
    be carried out with the appropriate intention (niyyah). This amount of ten percent is not
    being paid as zakaat; it is being given as a voluntary act of charity. So this
    co-operative organization has to pay zakaat. And Allaah knows best."

What was the hairstyle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? And what hairstyles are disallowed specifically?","Haircuts are halal except the following:
•	Al-Qaza’ style which is where part of the head is shaved and part is left. 
•	Styles that imitate the unbelievers or immoral people. 
•	Styles that imitate foolish people.","Praise be to Allah.Hairstyle of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
The hairstyle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned in a number of hadiths, such as the following: 

His hair was neither curly nor straight. 

Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, describing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he was of average height, neither very tall nor very short . He had a ruddy complexion, neither very white nor very dark, and his hair was neither curly nor straight. The revelation came to him when he was forty years old.  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3354; Muslim, 2338) 

His hair came down to his earlobes. 

Al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of average height and broad shouldered. He had hair that came down to his earlobes. I saw him wearing a red garment and I never saw anyone more handsome than him. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3358; Muslim, 2337) 

His hair sometimes came down to his shoulders. 

Qatadah said: I asked Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) about the hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said, “The hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was neither curly nor straight, and came down to a point between his ears and his shoulders.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5565; Muslim, 2337)
According to another report, his hair used to touch his shoulders. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5563; Muslim, 2338)
Sometimes his hair was shorter than that. All of this may be understood as referring to different situations, and each of the Companions narrated what he had seen. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to dye his hair sometimes. 

‘Uthman ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muhib said: I entered upon Umm Salamah and she brought out to us one of the hairs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which was dyed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5558) 
Ahmad (25328) added: “… dyed with henna and katam.” 
Katam is a plant that is used to dye hair. When mixed with henna, it gives the hair a colour between black and red. (See ‘Awn al-Ma’bud, commentary on hadith no. 4205)

He used to part his hair. 

‘Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to let his hair hang down over his forehead and the pagans used to part their hair, and the People of the Book used to let their hair hang down over their foreheads. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to be like the People of the Book in matters where there was no specific command. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) parted his hair. ((Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3365; Muslim, 2336).
Some of the scholars discussed the meaning of this hadith, and their comments were summed up by Imam al-Nawawi as follows: 
The correct view is that both letting the hair hang down over the forehead and parting it are permissible, but that parting is better. (Sharh Muslim, 15/90) 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did his Farewell Pilgrimage when his hair was stuck together. 

(This means) making some parts of the hair stick to others using gum or something similar, so that the hair is held together and avoids getting dirty and does not need to be washed. This is easier for the person who is in ihram, especially in the past when the person in ihram was faced with a lot of dirt and little water. 
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raising his voice in the Talbiyah, with his hair stuck together. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5570; Muslim, 1184)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sometimes used to braid his hair, especially when travelling, to keep it from getting dusty. 

Umm Hani said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah with four braids.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1781; Abu Dawud, 4191; Ibn Majah, 3631. Classed as sahih by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/360” 
Halal haircuts in Islam
With regard to the kinds of hairstyles that are forbidden, they are characterized by the following:                                                                                                  

Al-Qaza’ (lit. tufts), which is where part of the head is shaved and part is left. 

Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade al-qaza’. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5466; Muslim, 3959) 
One of the narrators of this hadith defines al-qaza’ as shaving part of a child’s head and leaving some of his hair. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to shaving part of the head and leaving part , this is of varying degrees. 
The worst is shaving the middle of the head and leaving the sides, as the Christian monks do. 
After that comes shaving the sides and leaving the middle, as many of the foolish and worthless people do. 
After that comes shaving the front of the head and leaving the back. 
These three types all come under the heading of qaza’ which was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but some of them are worse than others.” (Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 3/1294) 

Imitating the unbelievers or immoral people. 

There are many such hairstyles, some of which come under the heading of qaza’ – such as the “Marines” haircut, which is forbidden for two reasons, the fact that it is a kind of qaza’ and the fact that it is an imitation of the unbelievers . Some of them do not involve qaza’ but they are styles that belong to the unbelievers, such as making some of the hair stand up and letting the rest hang down, and so on. 
This also includes every hairstyle that belongs to the unbelievers or immoral people, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to resemble them in that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031. Classed as hasan by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/271. its isnad was classed as jayyid by Shaykh al-Islam in Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p. 82) 
Shaykh al-Islam said: 
“The least that we can say about this hadith is that it implies that it is haram to imitate them, although the apparent meaning is that the one who imitates them is a kafir, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya), then surely, he is one of them.” [al-Maidah 5:51]” (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p. 83)

Imitating foolish people. 

These are hairstyles worn by some of the foolish people, which may be included in the categories mentioned above. 
And Allah knows best."
974,3365,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3365,Ruling on the one    who sins openly and tells his friends about it,"Question

I heard from our Friday khutbah that a person will not be forgiven if he has bragged and boasted to his friends about his sin while Allah had hidden it, and he quoted a hadeeth to support his claim. Is this true ? I thought Allah forgives all sins! I am really in despair now.",,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the idea that Allaah forgives all sins: this is correct, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53].
Minor sins (saghaa’ir) are expiated for by doing acts of worship and by avoiding major sins (kabaa’ir), because of the following evidence (daleel):


Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:31]
It was reported from Ibn Mas’ood that a man kissed a woman, then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about it. Then Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as- Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins).” [Hood 11:114]. The man said, O Messenger of Allaah, is this just for me? He said, “It is for all of my Ummah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 503; Muslim, 2763)
It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The five prayers and Jumu’ah are an expiation from one week to the next, so long as you do not commit major sins.” (Narrated by Muslim, 233).
There are many things that expiate for minor sins, such as fasting, qiyaam, wudoo’, etc. But major sins require specific acts of expiation, such as sincere repentance, the carrying out of the Islamic punishment (hadd) on the one who committed them, etc., as can be seen in the following texts:


It was reported from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when there was a group of his Sahaabah around him: “Give allegiance to me that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, not steal, not commit fornication, not kill your children… and not disobey me in what is right. Whoever among you fulfils this, his reward will be with Allaah. Whoever commits any of these sins will be punished in this world and that will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these sins but Allaah conceals it, then it will be for Allaah to decide: if He wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him.” So we gave allegiance to him on that basis.


The phrase “he will be punished in this world” means, the Islamically-prescribed punishment (hadd) will be carried out on him.
It was reported from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleasd with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among the Children of Israel there was a man who killed ninety-nine people. Then he went out and came to a monk and asked him, ‘Can I repent?’ He said, ‘No,’ so he killed him. Then he started asking, and a man said to him, ‘Go to such and such a town.’ But death caught up with him, so he inclined his chest towards (that town, as he was dying). The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed concerning him. Allaah inspired (the good town) to come closer to him, and (the evil town) to move away from him, then He said, Measure the distance between them. They found that he was closer to (the good town) by a hand-span, so he was forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3283; Muslim, 2766).
But if a sinner dies in a state of sin, if his sins include shirk, then Allaah will not forgive him in the Hereafter. If his sins are less than that, then the person is subject to the will of Allaah – if He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him.


Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills” [al-Nisaa’ 4:48, 116].


It was reported that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “The believer will be brought close to his Lord until He conceals him and makes him confess his sin. Allaah will say, ‘Do you remember such and such a sin?’ The man will say, ‘Yes, I admit it.’ The Lord will say, ‘I concealed it for you in the world and I forgive you for it today.’ Then He will close up his record of good deeds. As for the others or the Kuffaar, it will be called out before the witnesses, ‘These are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord. The curse of Allaah is upon the wrongdoers.’”


(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4408; Muslim, 2768).


Your despairing of the mercy of Allaah is not permissible, because of the following evidence (daleel):




Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]. And He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and My Mercy embraces all things…” [al-A’raaf 7:156]


It was reported from Abu Moosa that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who committed sins during the day, and He spreads out His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who committed sins during the night. (He will continue to do this) until the sun rises from the West.”


(Narrated by Muslim, 2759).


Speaking about your sin and flaunting it openly in front of your friends is haraam, and is a major sin. It is one of the ways of spreading immorality among the Muslims, encouraging evil and tempting others to do similar things. It also means that one does not take sin seriously and regards it as insignificant, and that the sinner is damaging his own reputation and exposing his honour to the slander of others. Islam seeks to put people off from doing such things in the strongest possible terms, as in the following hadeeth:


Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “All of my ummah will be forgiven except those who sin openly. It is a part of sinning openly when a man does something at night, then the following morning when Allaah has concealed his sin, he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last night,’ when all night his Lord has concealed him and the next morning he uncovers what Allaah had concealed.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5721; Muslim, 2990).
On this basis:
We advise you to repent sincerely, and if you are tested with any kind of sin, do not speak openly of it or brag about it. You should be aware of the greatness of the One against Whom you are sinning, seek forgiveness for your sin, weep for the error of your ways and adhere strictly to the path of Allaah. Beware of despairing of the mercy of Allaah. If you adhere properly to the religion of Allaah, you will have glad tidings of goodness in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which He loves and is pleased with. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
975,3374,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3374,The contrast between the deeds of the Sahaabah and the deeds of the people at the end of time,"Question

I read a hadith in sahih al-jamii, where the Prophet said to the Sahaba that there would be Muslims that would come when the Religion is weak, and they would get reward equal to 50 times that of the Sahaba. I am confused, I thought that there was also a hadith where the Prophet said that the best generation is his, then the ones after them, and those after them. He also said that if someone gold that the sahaba gave?.",,"Praise be to Allah.In order to understand this issue we must note that there are two types of reward, the reward for knowledge and the reward for accompanying the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Some later members of the ummah may do deeds that are greater in reward than similar actions on the part of some of the Sahaabah because they will have no one to support and help them, and because they will be subject to a great deal of temptation, but they will not have the reward of having accompanied the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and met him.
 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
The hadeeth “The righteous among them will have the reward of fifty of you” does not mean that people other than the Sahaabah are superior to the Sahaabah, because simply having more reward does not prove that one is superior. 
Moreover, the difference in reward is with regard to the same type of deed. But the superiority attained by one who saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cannot be matched by anyone. 
This is how we may interpret the ahaadeeth quoted above.""(Fath al-Baari, 7/7 )
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
They – meaning the later members of the ummah – may have good deeds equivalent to those of fifty men among the Sahaabah, of the deeds that they did at that time. That is because the Sahaabah had help and support in that, whereas those who come later may not have help and support. But the fact that the reward will be multiplied for them in cases where it is not multiplied for the Sahaabah does not mean that they are better than the Sahaabah or that their virtue is any greater than that of the Sahaabah. What the Sahaabah achieved in terms of faith, jihad and fighting the people of this earth by supporting the Messenger, believing what he said and obeying his teachings before his call spread, his word prevailed, the number of his supporters increased and the proof of his Prophethood became widely known, indeed when the believers were so few in number and the disbelievers and hypocrites were so many, and the believers spent their wealth for the sake of Allah, seeking His pleasure in that situation, is something that no one can achieve the like of any more. As it says in al-Saheehayn, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not curse the Sahaabah, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you spent the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not attain the level of any one of them, or even come half way.”(Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 13/65, 66 _
Moreover, there is no virtuous deed that those who come later can do, but those who came before did something similar in a more perfect fashion. 
With regard to the words “They will have the reward of fifty of you because you have supporters who help you to do good and they will not have any supporters who will help them to do good,” this is correct in a case where a deed done by a single person among those who come later are like the deed done by a group of people among those who came before, so he will have the reward of fifty. But you should not imagine that one of those who come later will do deeds like those of some of the major Sahaabah such as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, for there will never again be a Prophet like Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with whom people may do deeds like those that were done with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
With regard to the words, “My ummah is like the rain, I do not know whether the first of it is better or the last of it,” although this hadeeth is not very sound, what it means is that among those who come later there will be those who are similar to those who came before, and they will be so close that the one who tries to compare them will not know which is better, even though one of them is in fact better. 
This is glad tidings for those who come later, that among them will be those who are close to those who came before them, as it says in another hadeeth: “The best of my ummah are the first and the last, and between them there will be some crookedness. Would that I could see my brethren.” They said, “Are we not your brethren?” He said, “You are my companions.” This shows that precedence was given to the Sahaabah, because they alone are his companions, which is a higher status than merely being brothers.”(Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 11/370, 371 )
It is worth pointing out that there is no basis for the phrase used in the question, “the best of generations is my generation”, although it is often used in the books of Ahl al-Sunnah. Moreover, there is a mistake with regard to its meaning. If this is what he said, then he would have said after it, “then the one that follows it.” But the wording of the hadeeth is “then those who follow them.” The wording of the saheeh hadeeth is: “The best of mankind/people is my generation” and “The best of my ummah is my generation.” 
And Allah knows best."

                In my area one of the requirements for renting a car is to have a credit      card. You don't have to charge anything on the card, you just must present it for safety precautions. When the car is returned you can pay cash and nothing is ever charge to the card. So, I would like to know, is it halal to get a credit card for this purpose.",,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that interest-based transactions are haraam and
    it is not permissible to engage in them. This includes the conditions mentioned in the
    contracts for credit cards. In some countries they rely a great deal on these credit
    cards, and you can hardly find anyone who does not use them. We put the following question
    to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen:
Credit cards include conditions based on riba (interest/usury) 
    if you delay payments, they charge an extra penalty. But in the place where I live in
    America, I cannot rent a car or a shop or use many other services unless I have a credit
    card. If I do not use a credit card, I will suffer unbearable hardship. If I commit myself
    to make the payments within a certain time limit, so that I do not have to pay the
    interest charges, will this allow me to have a credit card and thus relieve some of the
    hardship I am facing?
The shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, answered as follows:
If the hardship he is facing is certain, and the likelihood that he
    will delay payments is remote, then I hope there is nothing wrong with him having the
    credit card.
Question:
Do the conditions relating to interest make a transaction invalid or
    not?
Answer:
If a contract contains an invalid condition, this
    does not invalidate the entire contract, for a number of reasons: (1) necessity, (2)
    because it does not really affect anything. The man thinks that he is going to make the
    payments before interest is due. Because this is more likely than the condition of having
    to pay interest, and because it is necessary  which is the main point  I hope
    that there is nothing wrong with it. We have a definite matter  necessity  and
    a matter which is not necessarily going to happen  which is delay in payment 
    and the matter that is definite takes precedence over something which may not even happen.

978,3404,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3404,A      woman walked in front of our row when we were praying in jamaa’ah,"Question

A sister walked in front of a row of sisters praying behind the imaam. (There were only a few of us in the row and the sister walked so quickly that we could not stop her before she took her place in line.)I understand that three things invalidate the prayer if they pass between the praying person and the sutra, which are the donkey, black dog, and a woman . How should we start our prayer again and still follow the imaam ?",,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the idea that a person’s prayer is invalidated if a woman, donkey or black dog passes in front of him, this is correct.
 It was reported from ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Saamit that Abu Dharr said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If any one of you stands up to pray, then he has a sutrah [an item placed in front of a praying person as a “screen”] if he has something the height of the back of a saddle in front of him. If he does not have something the height of the back of a saddle in front of him, then his prayer is invalidated if a donkey or a woman or a black dog passes in front of him.’” I [‘Abd-Allah] asked, “O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?” He said, “O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the same question, and he said, ‘The black dog is a shaytaan (devil).’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510).
 The height of the back of a saddle is one cubit or 2/3 of a cubit.
 But this ruling applies only when one of these three pass in front of the imaam or a person who is praying on his own, not when they pass between the rows of a congregation praying behind the imaam during prayer in jamaa’ah, as the sister who asked the question thinks.
 The evidence for that is the report in which ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas said: “I came along riding on a female donkey one day when I had just reached the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was leading the people in prayer in Mina, without any kind of wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row, then I got down and sent the donkey to graze, and joined the row, and no one rebuked me for that.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 472; Muslim, 504)
 Imaam al-Bukhari gave this hadeeth the heading of “Sutrat al-Imaam sutrat man khalfahu (the sutrah of the imaam is the sutrah of those behind him).” This hadeeth clearly proves our point, which is that the person who is praying behind the imaam does not have to have a sutrah, and it does not matter what passes in front of him, especially since Ibn ‘Abbaas passed in front of them with his donkey, which is one of the things which invalidates prayer if it passes in front of the imaam or a person who is praying on his own.
 Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said:
 This hadeeth – i.e., the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhari (487) and Muslim (505) from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri which says “If any one of you is praying, he should not let anyone pass in front of him. Let him push him away as much as he can, and if he insists then let him fight him, for he is nothing but a shaytaan (devil)” – indicates that it is makrooh to pass in front of a person who is praying if he is praying on his own and without a sutrah. The same ruling applies to the imaam if he is praying without a sutrah. But with regard to the person who is praying behind the imaam, it does not matter what passes in front of him, just as it does not matter what passes in front of the imaam or person praying alone if it passes behind the sutrah. The sutrah of the imaam is also the sutrah of those who are praying behind him.
 We say this concerning the imaam and the person who prays alone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If any one of you is praying…” According to the scholars, this means praying on his own, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Hence we say that the person who is praying behind the imaam does not have to push away the person who passes in front of him, because Ibn ‘Abbaas said:“I came along riding on a female donkey one day when I had just reached the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was leading the people in prayer in Mina, without any kind of wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row, then I got down and sent the donkey to graze, and joined the row, and no one rebuked me for that.”(al-Tamheed, 4/187)
 On this basis, the sister who asked this question, and other people, do not have to push away anyone who passes in front of them if they are praying behind the imaam, and there is no sin on the person who passes in front of the row if this is donefor a reason. Pushing a person away and preventing them from passing in front is to be done by the imaam or the person who is praying alone, if a person wants to pass between him and his sutrah.

However, when she asked for an advice, most of us told her that the husband has to take shahada (become Muslim) or she should not remain married to him otherwise. Unfortunately, some other people don't believe so and advised her the opposite way; that she just should remain with the husband and so on,.... I would like you to send me concrete cases at the time of the Prophet where Muslim women (sahabiyyat) would leave their non-Muslim husbands if they decided not to convert. I think those cases would be the only proof to convince the people of that list that Muslim women are not allowed to marry or remain married to non-Muslim men even though they are not against the woman's conversion.",,"Praise be to Allah.What you have said in your question about it being haraam (unlawful)for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man is correct, and there is no doubt concerning that.


Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):


And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon (polytheists)till they believe [al-Baqarah 2:221]
Al-Qurtubi said:
And give not (your daughters) in marriage means, do not give Muslim women in marriage to Mushrik (pagan)men. The ummah (Muslim nation)is agreed that a Mushrik should not marry a Muslim woman because this is like putting Islam in an inferior position. (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 3/72).
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]
Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
Chapter: when a mushrik or Christian woman who is married to a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) or a harbi (non-Muslim belonging to a people who are hostile towards Islam) becomes Muslim. Abd al-Waarith said, narrating from Khaalid from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbaas: if a Christian woman becomes Muslim shortly before her husband, she is forbidden for him Mujaahid said: if he becomes Muslim during the iddah [waiting period following divorce], then he may (re)marry her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]. Al-Hasan and Qutaadah said concerning two Magians who became Muslim that their marriage was still valid. If one of them had become Muslim and the other had refused, the woman would have been divorced and he would no longer have any rights over her.
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari. See al-Fath, 9/421).


Examples of such women include:


Zaynab, the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She was married to Abul-Aas ibn al-Rabee during the Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) but when she became Muslim, their marriage was annulled, and she went and stayed with her father (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When her husband became Muslim, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent her back to him.
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1143; Abu Dawood, 2240; Ibn Maajah, 2009; classed as saheeh by Imaam Ahmad, 1789. Al-Tirmidhi said, there is nothing wrong with its isnaad).
The correct view is that the husband can go back to her with no need to renew the marriage contract.
If the woman is still in her iddah (waiting period), he has more right (than anyone else) to marry her. If her iddah has ended, she is free to choose whether to go back to him or not.
Al-Tirmidhi said:
On the basis of this hadeeth, the scholars said that if a woman becomes Muslim before her husband, then her husband becomes Muslim whilst she is still in her iddah, then the husband has more right to her whilst she is still in her iddah. This is the view of Maalik ibn Anas, al-Oozaai, al-Shaafai, Ahmad and Ishaaq.
(Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Hadeeth 1142).
Ibn Abd al-Barr said:
There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that if a non-Muslim woman becomes Muslim then her iddah ends, her husband has no rights concerning her if he has not become Muslim during her iddah.
(Al-Tamheed, 12/23).
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
But what the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicates is that the marriage comes to a halt. If he becomes Muslim before the end of her iddah, then she is (still) his wife, but if her iddah ends, then she may marry whomever she wants. If she likes, she can wait for him, and if he becomes Muslim she is his wife and there is no need to renew the marriage contract.
(Zaad al-Maaad, 5/137, 138)
Al-Qurtubi said:
Talhah ibn Ubayd-Allaah was married to Arwaa bint Rabeeah ibn al-Haarith ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They were separated by Islam, then in Islam Khaalid ibn Saeed ibn al-Aas married her. She was one of the [Muslim] wives of the non-Muslims who fled to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept her in Madinah and married her to Khaalid.
(Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 18/65, 66)
It was reported that Anas said: Abu Talhah married Umm Sulaym and the mahr (dowry)between them was Islam. Umm Sulaym became Muslim before Abu Talhah. He proposed marriage to her and she said, I have become Muslim. If you become Muslim I will marry you. So he became Muslim and that was the mahr between them.
(Narrated by al-Nasaai, 3340)
The daughter of al-Waleed ibn al-Magheerah, the wife of Safwaan ibn Umayyah, became Muslim before him, and the marriage was annulled. Then he became Muslim later on, and she went back to him. It was narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta, 1132. Ibn Abd al-Barr said: I do not know of any unbroken saheeh isnaad for this hadeeth, but it is famous and well known to the scholars of seerah, Ibn Shihaab, the leader of the scholars of seerah, and al-Shubi. The fame of this hadeeth is stronger than its isnaad in sha Allaah.
(al-Tamheed, 12/19)
Umm Hakeem bint al-Haarith ibn Hishaam, the wife of Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. Her marriage was annulled, then he became Muslim during her iddah, so she went back to her husband.
(Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 4/107)

                I would like to know whether it is allowed for a person to use water that maybe unclean for wudu.  What if the water is not suitable for drinking due to it being unclean, can one rinse their mouth out with this water?",,"Praise be to Allah.This 
          question was answered for us by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Munayyi’, who 
          said:
“One 
          of the basic principles of sharee’ah is the hadeeth of the Messenger 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him), who said: ‘There should be neither harming nor reciprocating 
          harm.’ Part of this principle is that the Muslim is not permitted to 
          harm himself, which includes not using contaminated water for doing 
          wudoo’.
So it 
          is forbidden to do wudoo’ using contaminated water, but if a person 
          does do wudoo’ using such water his wudoo’ is still valid, because it 
          is not naajis (ritually impure), but his action is haraam because he 
          is harming himself. And Allaah knows best.”"

At what point does obedience to the creation in disobedience to Allah, become shirk? For example if my parents tell me to shave my beard, and I listen, am I then committing shirk? When is it considered to be shirk?",,"Praise be to Allah.Obedience to a created being becomes shirk in situations such as obeying that person in matters where what is forbidden is deemed to be allowed, and vice versa, or when that person issues rules and regulations, or laws, that go against the laws of Allah, and the follower believes that these laws are more complete and better than the laws of Allah, or as good as His laws, or that the laws of Allah are better but it is permissible to follow these man-made laws. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah (by obeying then in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allah)…” [al-Tawbah 9:31]. ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said: “O Messenger of Allah, we do not worship them.”
[He was a Christian who became a Muslim - Translator]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do they not allow you that which Allah has forbidden and forbid what Allah has allowed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “This is a kind of worship.” The Christians’ obedience of their priests in sin and in accepting what they say about what is lawful or unlawful is a form of worshipping something other than Allah, which is a kind of shirk akbar (major shirk), that contradicts Tawheed (true monotheism).
With regard to your question, if the person who obeys his parents in sin believes that it is in fact a sin, but he does what he does because of his own desires or because he is afraid of his parents’ punishment, but it is not the matter of being forced to do so, then he is a sinner who has gone against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), There is no obedience to a created being if it involves disobedience of the Creator”
(reported by Ahmad, 1041; a saheeh hadeeth) – but he is not considered to be guilty of shirk akbar. But if the son believes that what his parents say overrules what Allah says about halaal and haraam, then he is guilty of shirk akbar. The Muslim has to strive against himself to bring his desires in line with what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught, and so that he gives precedence to obeying Allah and His Messenger over obeying anyone else, and so that Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anyone else. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father, and all the people.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 63). And Allah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

Is it better Islamically for a pregnant Muslim woman to fast or not fast in the month of Ramadan?.","A pregnant Muslim woman is obliged to fast unless she fears for herself or for her baby, in which case it is permissible for her not to fast. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.Is a pregnant woman obliged to fast?
A pregnant Muslim woman is obliged to fast , just like anyone else, unless she fears for herself or for her baby, in which case it is permissible for her not to fast. 
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184] 
“This was a concession granted to old men and old women who are able to fast but it is difficult, so they are allowed not to fast, and must feed one poor person for each day ; and for those who are sick or pregnant, if they fear for their children, they are allowed not to fast and must feed (one poor person for each day).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2317; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 4/25, 18) 
Cases of fasting during pregnancy
It should be noted that it may be permissible, obligatory or haram for a pregnant woman not to fast. 

It is permissible for her not to fast if fasting is too difficult for her, but will not harm her. 
It is obligatory for her (not to fast) if fasting will cause harm to her or her baby. 
It is haraam for her (not to fast) if no hardship results from her fasting. 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
In the case of a pregnant woman, one of two scenarios must apply: 

She is strong and active, and fasting does not cause any hardship to her or affect her baby. This woman is obliged to fast, because she has no excuse for not fasting. 
When a woman is not able to fast, because the pregnancy is too difficult for her, or because she is physically weak, or for some other reason. In this case she should break the fast, especially if it will cause harm to her baby – in which case she is obliged not to fast. (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/487)

Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Pregnant and breastfeeding women come under the same ruling as those who are sick. If fasting is too difficult for them, it is prescribed for them to break the fast, and they have to make up missed fasts when they are able to do so, just as in the case of one who is sick. 
Some of the scholars were of the view that it is sufficient for them to feed one poor person for each day missed, but this is a weak view. The correct view is that they have to make up the missed days, as is the case of those who were sick and for travelers, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:184] 
This is also indicated by the hadith of Anas ibn Malik al-Ka’bi, according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah has exempted the traveler from the obligation of fasting and has reduced the prayer by half for him, and has exempted pregnant and breastfeeding women from the obligation of fasting.” (Narrated by the five) (Tuhfat al-Ikhwan bi Ajwibah Muhimmah Tata’allaq bi Arkan al-Islam, p. 171)

My question is regarding the tribes of Yajuj and Majuj. I understand that they are huge in number, are plunderers and are destined for hell fire.
My question is: do they still exist? If they do, are they confined within the wall erected by Dhul Qarnain? Is this wall (doorway) imaginary or physical (made of metal)?","Yajuj and Majuj are two huge nations of the sons of Adam. They exist at present, and they are attempting on a daily basis to get out and attack people. For more, see the detailed answer.","Praise be to Allah.Who are Yajuj and Majuj?
There is no doubt that Yajuj and Majuj are two huge nations of the sons of Adam. Anyone who reads the story of Dhu’l-Qarnayn and how he dealt with this nation in Surat al-Kahf will know for sure that they exist and that the barrier which was built is not metaphorical or imaginary, but is a physical barrier built of iron and melted copper. 
The basic principle is that we should take this Quranic text as it is, without resorting to any kind of misinterpretation or trying to twist the intended meaning.
Wall of Dhu’l-Qarnayn: Real or imaginary?
The Quran has told us how the barrier was built and what materials were used, so it is not right to say that it is a metaphorical or imaginary barrier. In Surat al-Kahf, Allah has told us the story of the Muslim king and the great leader Dhu’l-Qarnayn (may Allah have mercy on him):
“Until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them, a people who scarcely understood a word.
They said, ‘O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Verily! Yajuj and Majuj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?’
He said: ‘That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier.
Give me pieces (blocks) of iron,’ then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said, ‘Blow,’ till when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it.’
So they [Yajuj and Majuj ] were made powerless to scale it or dig through it.
(Dhu’l-Qarnayn) said: ‘This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true.’” [al-Kahf 18:93-98]
Hadiths about Yajuj and Majuj 
What indicates that these nations exist at present, and indeed are attempting on a daily basis to get out and attack people, is the hadith reported by Ibn Majah with a sahih isnad from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Yajuj and Majuj are digging every day until they can almost see sunlight, then the one who is in charge of them says, “Go back, we will dig again tomorrow.” Then Allah restores (the barrier) and makes it stronger than it was. (This will continue) until the appointed time. When Allah wishes to send them against the people, they will dig until they can almost see sunlight, then the one who is in charge of them will say, “Go back, we will dig again tomorrow, in sha Allah.” This time he will say “in sha Allah”, so when they come back (the next day), they will find it as they left it, so they will dig their way out and emerge to attack the people. They will dry up water (by drinking it, because of their great numbers), and the people will seek to protect themselves from them in their fortresses. They will fire their arrows into the sky, and the arrows will come back down covered in blood (as a test for them), and they will say, “We have defeated the people of the earth and have gained the upper hand over the people of heaven.” Then Allah will send worms on the napes of their necks, which will kill them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the beasts of the earth will grow fat from their flesh.” (Sahih Ibn Majah, 3298)
Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan reported from Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her in an agitated state and said, “La ilaha ill-Allah, woe to the Arabs from an evil that has approached! Today a hole like this has been opened in the barrier of Yajuj and Majuj ,” and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?’ He said, ‘Yes, if evil becomes overwhelming.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3097).

Is it permissible to combine all the five prayers, at the start of a journey, if you have an intention to travel a long distance requiring very long hours of traveling. If not, then how many prayers can be combined at each time?
May Allah accept your effort in helping your Muslim brothers to better understand their religion.","It is not permissible to combine all five prayers at one time even if it is because of travelling. Indeed, it is not permissible to combine three prayers, so it is not correct to combine Maghrib, `Isha and Fajr.
What is permitted is to combine Zuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha’, but Fajr cannot be combined with any other prayer.","Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to combine all five prayers at one time, even if it is because of travelling. Indeed, it is not permissible to combine three prayers, so it is not correct to combine Maghrib, `Isha and Fajr, for example. 
What is permitted is to combine Zuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha’ , but Fajr cannot be combined with any other prayer. 
The reason for this is that each one of the five prayers has its appointed time which is clearly defined, and which should be adhered to as it says in the Quran:
“… Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.” [Al-Nisa 4:103]
This is also indicated by the hadith in which Jibril (peace be upon him) defined the times of each prayer and explained them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
It was not reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) combined all five prayers, only that he combined Zuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha . 
Acts of worship are based on reports, and combining prayers is an issue that has to do with acts of worship, so we should adhere to what it says in the texts and not try to take the matter any further. Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid reported scholarly consensus on this issue, as did Ibn Hubayrah. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said: “`Asr should not be combined with Maghrib, nor `Isha with Subh (Fajr), `Asr can only be combined with Zuhr, in accordance with what was reported.”
Al-Rafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permitted to combine Fajr prayer with any other prayer, or to combine `Asr and Maghrib, because no such thing was reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him in Talkhis al-Habir, 4/427)

“It is not permitted to combine Fajr with any other prayer or to combine `Asr with Maghrib .”

There is a deviant group of people who claim to follow the Quran only, and not the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet . Please provide us with scholarly proof that they are on the wrong path, so we can give them da'wah, Insha Allah.
Wassalaam",,"Praise be to Allah.Some people have started to claim that the Sunnah is not a source of legislation. They call themselves al-Quraniyyeen and say that we have the Quran, so we take as halaal whatever it allows and take as haraam whatever it forbids. The Sunnah, according to their claims, is full of fabricated ahaadeeth falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They are the successors of other people about whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Haakim reported with a saheeh isnaad from al-Miqdaam that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch, narrating a hadeeth from me, and he will say, Between us and you is the Book of Allah: what it says is halaal, we take as halaal, and what it says is haraam, we take as haraam. But listen! Whatever the Messenger of Allah forbids is like what Allah forbids. (Al-Fath al-Kabeer, 3/438. Al-Tirmidhi reported it with different wording, and said that it is hasan saheeh. Sunan al-Tirmidhi bi Sharh Ibn al-Arabi, al-Saawi edn., 10/132). The name al-Quraniyyeen does not befit these people, because the Quran tells us, in almost one hundred aayahs, to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Obedience to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is considered in the Quran to be a part of obedience to Allah, may He be glorified. He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them. [al-Nisa 4:80 interpretation of the meaning]. The Quran, which they claim to follow, denies the faith of the one who refuses to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and does not accept his ruling: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. [al-Nisa 4:65 interpretation of the meaning]
Their suggestion that the Sunnah is contaminated with fabricated ahaadeeth is not valid, because the scholars of this ummah took the utmost care to purify the Sunnah from all alien elements. If they had any doubts about the truthfulness of any narrator, or there was the slightest possibility that he could have forgotten something, this would be sufficient grounds for rejecting a hadeeth. Even the enemies of this ummah have stated that no other nation has paid so much attention to examining its reports and their narrators, especially in the case of reports narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
For it to be obligatory to follow a hadeeth, it is sufficient for it to be known that it is a saheeh (authentic, sound) hadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was content to convey his message by sending just one of his Companions, which proves that the hadeeth reported by one trustworthy person must be followed.
Moreover, we would ask these people: where are the aayaat which tell us how to pray, or which tell us that the obligatory prayers are five times daily, or which tell us about the nisaab on various kinds of wealth for the purpose of zakah, or about the details of the rituals of Hajj, and other rulings which we can only know from the Sunnah?

What is the virtues of Qiyaam (prayer at night) during Ramadan ?",,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to encourage us to pray at night in Ramadan, without making it obligatory. Then he said, ‘Whoever prays at night in Ramadan out of faith and the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.’ When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, this is how things were (i.e., Taraaweeh was not prayed in congregation), and this is how they remained during the khilaafah of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), until the beginning of the khilaafah of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).”
‘Amr ibn Murrah al-Juhani said: “A man from Qudaa’ah came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! What do you think if I testify that there is no god except Allah, and that you, Muhammad, are His Messenger, and I pray the five daily prayers, and fast in the month (of Ramadan), and pray at night in Ramadan, and pay zakah?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever dies on that will be among the siddeeqeen (those who tell the truth) and the martyrs.’”
Laylat al-Qadr and its timing
2 – The best of its nights is Laylat al-Qadr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays at night during Laylat al-Qadr and manages to “catch” it out of faith and the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.”
3 – According to the most correct opinion, it is the twenty-seventh night of Ramadan. Most of the ahaadeeth state this, such as the hadith of Zurr ibn Hubaysh, who said: “I heard Ubayy ibn Ka’b saying – and it was said to him that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: ‘Whoever follows the Sunnah will ‘catch’ Laylat al-Qadr!’ – Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘May Allah have mercy on him, he did not want people to take it for granted and only stay up to pray on one night. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, it is in Ramadan – he was swearing without a doubt – and by Allah, I do know which night it is. It is the night in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to pray (qiyaam). It is the night the morning of which is the twenty seventh, and the sign of it is that the sun rises on that morning white and without rays.’”
In another report, this was attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Reported by Muslim and others).
Praying qiyaam in congregation
It is allowed to pray qiyaam in congregation, indeed it is better than praying individually, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did himself and explained its virtues. Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We fasted Ramadan with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he did not lead us in qiyaam at all until there were only seven days left, when he led us in prayer until a third of the night had passed. When there were six days left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were five days left, he led us in prayer until half the night had passed. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I wish that you had continued until the end of the night.’ He said, ‘If a man prays with the imaam until he finishes, it will be counted as if he prayed the whole night.’ When there were four nights left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were three nights left, he brought together his family, his wives and the people, and led us in qiyaam until we were afraid that we would miss al-falaah. I asked, ‘What is al-falaah?’ he said, ‘Suhoor. Then he did not lead us in qiyaam for the rest of the month.’” (Saheeh hadith reported by the authors of Sunan).
The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not continually lead the people in praying qiyaam in congregation
5 - The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not lead them in qiyaam for the rest of the month because he feared that it would then become obligatory, and they would not be able to do it, as is stated in the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah reported in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere. Following the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that fear was no longer a factor, because Allah had completed the religion. The reason for not praying qiyaam in congregation during Ramadan no longer applied, and the previous ruling, that congregational prayer is something prescribed in Islam, remained in effect. So ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) revived the practice, as is recorded in Saheeh al-Bukhari and elsewhere.
Women can pray qiyaam in congregation
Women can attend the prayers too, as is stated in the hadith of Abu Dharr referred to above. Indeed, it is permissible to appoint an imaam just for them, apart from the imaam of the men. It was proven that when ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) gathered the people to pray qiyaam, he appointed Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the men and Sulaymaan ibn Abi Hathmah to lead the women. ‘Arfajah al-Thaqafi said: “ ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) used to command the people to pray during the night in Ramadan, and he would appoint an imaam for the men and an imaam for the women. I was the imaam for the women.”
I say: this is fine in my view so long as the mosque is big enough so that they will not disturb one another.
Number of rak`ahs of qiyaam
7 – The number of rak`ahs is eleven, and it is preferable in our opinion not to exceed this number, following the practice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he never did more than that in his life. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about how he prayed in Ramadan. She said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never prayed more than eleven rak`ahs (of qiyaam), whether during Ramadan or any other time. He would pray four, and don’t ask me how beautiful or how long they were. Then he would pray four, and don’t ask me how beautiful or how long they were. Then he would pray three.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and others).
8- A person may do less than that, even if it is only one rak`ah of witr, because of the evidence that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did this and spoke about it.
With regard to him doing it: ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked how many rak`ahs the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray in witr? She said, “He used to pray four and three, or six and three, or ten and three. He never used to pray less than seven, or more than thirteen.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and others).
With regard to him speaking about it, he said: “Witr is true, so whoever wishes can pray five, and whoever wishes can pray three, and whoever wishes can pray one.”
Reciting Qur’aan in qiyaam
9 – As regards reciting from the Qur’aan during qiyaam, whether in Ramadan or at other times, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not set a limit or state what was too much or too little. His recitation used to vary, sometimes it would be long, at other times short. Sometimes in every rak`ah he would recite the equivalent of ‘Yaa ayyuha’l-muzammil, which is twenty aayaat; sometimes he would recite the equivalent of fifty aayaat. He used to say, “Whoever prays at night and reads one hundred aayaat will not be recorded as one of the negligent.” According to another hadith: “…and reads two hundred aayaat, will be recorded as one of the devout and sincere believers.”
When he was sick, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the seven long soorahs in his night prayers, i.e., al-Baqarah, Aal ‘Imraan, al-Nisaa’, al-Maa’idah, al-An’aam, al-A’raaf and al-Tawbah.
In the account of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan praying behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in one rak`ah he recited al-Baqarah, al-Nisa’ and Aal ‘Imraan, and he recited them in a slow and measured tone. It is proven with the soundest (most saheeh) of isnaads that when ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) appointed Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the people in praying eleven rak`ahs in Ramadan, Ubayy used to recite aayaat by the hundreds, so that the people behind him would be leaning on sticks because the prayers were so long, and they did not finish until just before Fajr.
It is also reported in a saheeh account that ‘Umar called the readers during Ramadan, and told the fastest of them to recite thirty aayaat, the moderate ones to recite twenty-five aayaat, and the slowest ones to recite twenty aayaat.
However, is a person is praying qiyaam by himself, he can make it as long as he wishes; if others agree with the imaam, he may also make it as long as he wishes. The longer it is, the better, but a person should not go to extremes and spend the whole night in qiyaam, except on rare occasions, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.” If a person is praying as an imaam, he should make it only as long as is easy for the people behind him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any of you leads the people in prayer, let him make it short, because among them are the young and the old, the weak, and those who have pressing needs. But if he is praying alone, let him make it as long as he likes.”
The timing of qiyaam
10 – The time for praying qiyaam is from after ‘Isha until Fajr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has added one more prayer for you, which is witr, so pray it between Salaat al-‘Isha’ and Salaat al-Fajr.”
11 – Praying at the end of the night is better, for those who can manage it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is afraid that he will not get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr at the beginning of the night, but whoever feels that he will be able to get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr at the end of the night, for prayer at the end of the night is witnessed [by the angels???], and that is better.”
12 – If it is the matter of choosing between praying in congregation at the beginning of the night and praying alone at the end of the night, it is preferable to pray with the jamaa’ah, because that is counted as if one had prayed the whole night through.
This is what the Sahaabah did at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari said: “I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab to the mosque one night during Ramadan, and saw the people scattered throughout the mosque, some praying individually, and some praying in small groups. He said, ‘By Allah, I think that if I gathered all of them behind one reader it would be better.’ So he resolved to do that, and he gathered them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. Then I went with him on another night, and the people were all praying behind their reader, and ‘Umar said, ‘What a good innovation this is. What they sleep and miss – meaning the latter part of the night – is better than what they are doing,’ – the people used to pray qiyaam at the beginning of the night.”
Zayd ibn Wahb said: “‘Abd-Allah used to lead us in prayer in Ramadan, and he used to finish at night.”
13 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying witr as three rak`ahs, and explained this by saying: “Do not make it resemble Salaat al-Maghrib.” Therefore the person who wants to pray three rak`ahs for witr must find a way to make it different (from Maghrib). There are two ways he can do this: either by giving salaam after the first two rak`ahs, which is the best way; or by not sitting after the first two rak`ahs (i.e., praying three rak`ahs non-stop). And Allah knows best.
Recitation during three rak`ahs of witr
14 – It is Sunnah to recite Sabbih bi ismi Rabbika al-‘A’laa in the first rak`ah, Qul Yaa ayyuha’l-Kaafiroon in the second rak`ah, and Qul Huwa Allahu ahad in the third rak`ah. Sometimes Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Falaq and Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Naas may be added as well.
It was reported in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once recited one hundred aayaat of Soorat al-Nisa’ in one rak`ah  of witr.
Du`a al-Qunoot
15 – A person may also humble himself before Allah by reciting the du`a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to his grandson al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), which is:
“Allahumma’hdinee fiman hadayta wa ‘aafinee fiman ‘aafayta wa tawallanee fiman tawallayta wa baarik lee fimaa a’tayta wa qinee sharra maa qadayt, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa ‘alayk. Wa innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta wa laa ya’izzu man ‘aadayt. Tabaarakta Rabbanaa wa ta’aalayt. Laa majaa minka illa ilayk (O Allah, guide me along with those whom You have guided, pardon me along with those whom You have pardoned, be an ally to me along with those whom You are an ally to, and bless for me that which You have bestowed. Protect me from the evil You have decreed for verily You decree and none can decree over You. For surety, he whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take an enemy is never honored and mighty. O our Lord, Blessed and Exalted are You. There is no refuge from You except with You).”
Sometimes one may send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is nothing wrong with adding other du`as that are known from the Sunnah.
16 – There is nothing wrong with reciting Qunoot after rukoo’, or with adding curses against the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or praying for the Muslims in the second half of Ramadan, because it is proven that the imaam used to do this at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). At the end of the hadith of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Ubayd al-Qaari mentioned above, it says: “… They used to curse the kuffaar in the middle, saying, ‘Allahumma qaatil al-kafarata alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelik wa yukadhdhiboona rusulak wa laa yu’minoona bi wa’dik. Wa khaalif bayna kalimatihim wa alqi fi quloobihim al-ru’b wa alqi ‘alayhim rijzaka wa ‘adhaabak ilaah al-haqq (O Allah, destroy the kuffaar who are trying to prevent people from following Your path, who deny Your Messengers and who do not believe in Your promise (the Day of Judgement). Make them disunited, fill their hearts with terror and send Your wrath and punishment against them, O God of Truth).” Then he would send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and pray for good for the Muslims as much as he could, and seek forgiveness for the believers.
After he had finished cursing the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet, seeking forgiveness for the believing men and women and asking for his own needs, he would say: “Allahumma iyyaaka na’bud wa laka nusalli wa najud, wa ilayka nas’aa wa nahfud, wa narju rahmataka rabbanaa wa nakhaafu ‘adhaabak al-jadd. Inna ‘adhaabaka liman ‘aadayta mulhaq (O Allah, You do we worship, to You do we pray and prostrate, for Your sake we strive and toil. We place our hope in Your Mercy, O our Lord, and we fear Your mighty punishment, for Your punishment will certainly overtake the one whom You have taken as an enemy.” Then he would say “Allahu akbar” and go down in sujood.
What should be said at the end of witr
17 – It is Sunnah to say at the end of witr (before or after the salaam):
“Allahumma innee a’oodhu bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika, wa a’oodhu bika minka. La uhsee thanaa’an ‘alayka, anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsik (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your protection from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from You. I cannot praise You enough, and You are as You have praised Yourself.”
18 – When he gave salaam at the end of witr, he said: “Subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos, subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos, subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy), elongating the syllables, and raising his voice the third time.
Two rak`ahs after witr
19 – A person may pray two rak`ahs after witr if he wishes, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did this. Indeed, he said, “This travelling is exhausting and difficult, so after any one of you prays witr, let him pray two rak`ahs. If he wakes up, this is fine, otherwise these two rak`ahs will be counted for him.
20 – It is Sunnah to recite Idha zulzilat al-ard and Qul yaa ayyuha’l-kaafiroon in these two rak`ahs."

Some people, when they pray witr with the imam and he says salam, they get up and do another rakah, because they want to do more prayers before praying witr later in the night. What is the ruling on this action? Is it considered to be forsaking the prayer with the imam?",,"Praise be to Allah.We do not see anything wrong with this, and the ulama stated that there is nothing wrong with doing this, so that his witr will be at the end of the night. He will be considered to have prayed with the imam until he finished, because he stayed with him until he finished, and added another rakah for a shar'i reason, which was so that he could pray witr later in the night. There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not mean that he did not stay with the imam until he finished, but he did not finish with him he delayed it a little longer."
989,3454,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3454,Arabic numerals vs. European numerals,"Question

                There is a theory current among some educated people which says that the Arabic numerals in their current form (?-?-?-?, etc.)
 are actually Indian numerals, and that the European numerals (1-2-3-4, etc.) are the original Arabic numerals. This conclusion leads them a step further, so that they call for the use of the European form of numerals in Arab countries, supporting their demand with the fact that the European numerals are used in calculations and dealings with foreign states and institutions which have come to have a great deal of influence on the economic and social affairs of Arab countries. They also refer to the appearance of calculators and      computers which only use these numerals, and this – they claim – makes the use of European numerals in Arab countries something to be desired, if not unavoidable. What do you think?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to change the Arabic numerals which are currently
    in use and replace them with the numerals used in the western world, for the following
    reasons:
Firstly: there is no proof of what the advocates of change say about
    the numerals used in the West being Arabic numerals. What is known is something other than
    that, as is proven by reality and the fact that for centuries the current numerals were
    used in different circumstances and different fields, which makes them Arabic. There are
    words in the Arabic language which were not originally Arabic, but they became part of the
    Arabic language through usage, to the extent that some of these words are to be found in
    the Qur’aan; these words are described as Arabized.
Secondly: this idea has bad consequences and harmful effects, because
    it is a step towards the gradual Westernization of Islamic societies.
Thirdly: it paves the way for changing the Arabic script and using
    Latin script instead of Arabic, even in the long run.
Fourthly: it is an aspect of imitating the West and approving of its
    ways.
Fifthly: all the copies of the Qur’aan (masaahif), books of
    Tafseer, Arabic dictionaries and other books use the current Arabic numerals in numbering
    their pages etc., and in referring to other sources. All these books represent a vast
    store of knowledge. If the foreign numerals are used instead, this will make it very
    difficult for the coming generation to access this vast store of knowledge.
Sixthly: It is not necessary to follow certain Arab countries which are
    accustomed to using these European numerals. Many of these countries have also abolished
    something even more important, which is ruling according to the whole sharee’ah of
    Allaah, which is the source of honour, power and happiness in this world and the next, so
    what they (those countries) have done is nothing to go by."
990,3455,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3455,Which is better during the day in Ramadaan – reading Qur’aan or praying voluntary prayers?,"Question

Which is better during the day in Ramadaan – reading Qur’aan or praying voluntary prayers?",,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was to do a lot of different kinds of worship during Ramadaan. Jibreel used to review the Qur’aan with him at night, and when Jibreel met with him, he was more generous in charity than the blowing wind. He was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous in Ramadaan. At this time he used to give more in charity and treat people even more kindly; he would read more Qur’aan, pray more, recite more dhikr, and spend time in I’tikaaf (retreat). This is the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in this aspect of this holy month.
As to whether it is better to read Qur’aan or to pray voluntary prayers, this depends on people’s circumstances, and the true evaluation of this is up to Allaah, because He knows all things.
(From al-Jawaab al-Saheeh min Ahkaam Salaat al-Layl wa’l-Taraaweeh, by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, p. 45).
A specific action may be better in the case of any given individual, and another may be better for another individual, according to the degree to which a particular action brings a person closer to Allaah. Some people may be influenced more by naafil prayers and may focus on them and do them properly, which will bring them closer to Allaah than other deeds might, so in their case those deeds are better. And Allaah knows best."

The most correct opinion is that the number of rakahs for Tarawih is eleven, but I pray in a mosque where they do twenty one rakahs. Can I leave the mosque after the tenth rakah, or is it better to complete the twenty one rakahs with them?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is better to stay with the imam until he finishes, even if he is doing more than eleven rakahs, because it is permissible to do the extra rakahs, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever prays qiyaam with the imam until he finishes, Allah will record it as if he prayed the whole night
(reported by al-Nisaa'i and others. Sunan al-Nisaa'i, Baab Qiyaam Shahr Ramadan), and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Prayer at night should be two by two (rakahs), and when dawn approaches, pray one for witr. (Reported by the seven; this version reported by al-Nisaa'i).
There is no doubt that adhering to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is better and brings more reward, so long as it is done properly and without haste, but if it is the matter of a choice between leaving the imam because of the number of rakahs or going along with the extra that he does, it is better to go along with him, because of the ahaadeeth referred to above. At the same time, you should advise the imam to follow the Sunnah."

Is Tarawih prayer required for women?
Which is better for women, to perform Tarawih at home or in a mosque?","Tarawih prayer is not compulsory for women, and it is still better for them to perform the Night Prayer at home. But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that women are not permitted to go to the mosque.","Praise be to Allah.Is tarawih compulsory for females?
Tarawih prayer is not obligatory for women, and it is still better for them to perform the Night Prayer at home. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said:
""Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila'l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami', no. 7458)
Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""A woman's prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard , and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila'l-masjid. See also Sahih al-Jami', no. 3833)
Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa'idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you."" He said: ""I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque."" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she died. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy. )
But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith:
`Abdullah ibn `Umar said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) say: 'Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.'"" Bilal ibn `Abdullah said, ""By Allah, we will prevent them."" (Ibn `Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: ""I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say 'By Allah, we will prevent them'!!"" (Muslim, 667)
Conditions of women going out to the mosques 
But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows:

She should wear complete hijab.
She should not go out wearing perfume.
She should have the permission of her husband.

Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so.

I asked our Shaykh, 'Abd al-'Aziz, about Tarawih prayer in particular, and whether it is better for a woman to perform this prayer in the mosque . He replied in the negative and said that the hadiths that state that it is preferable for a woman to pray in her house apply to all prayers, and this includes Tarawih as well as others.

If his father gives zakaat al-fitr on his behalf there is nothing wrong with that, especially if the father is accustomed to giving zakaat al-fitr on behalf of his children every year even though they are grown up and working. He may like to continue doing what he is used to doing, and it may upset the father if his son tells him “Don’t give zakaat on my behalf.” So the son should give his father the opportunity to give zakaat on his behalf, and he should also give it on his own behalf. Some people consider the father’s continued giving of zakaat on behalf of his children to be a continuation of his connection to his children and a sign that they are still under his authority and care, so the son should let his father do what makes him happy.

Is it better to recite from the Mushaf than from memory? Please explain.",,"Praise be to Allah.If one is reciting Quran in situations other than in prayer, then reading from the Mushaf is better, because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better. But if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind (khushoo’), then one should recite from memory.
In prayer, however, it is better to recite from memory, because if a person recites from the Mushaf, he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the Mushaf, putting it down, turning its pages and looking at the letters. By doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer, or spreading out his arms during rukoo’ and sujood, if he puts the Mushaf under his arm. Hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the Mushaf.
We see some people when they pray behind the imaam, carrying the Mushaf and following the imaam’s recitation. This is something which should not be done, for the reasons we have referred to above, and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam.
However, if the imaam does not have such a good memory, and he says to one of the members of the congregation, “Pray behind me, and follow me (my recitation) in the Mushaf, and if I make a mistake, correct me,” then there is nothing wrong with this."

If, however, it is done for the purpose of learning, then there should be nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is that they gather to read Qur’an in order to learn it and memorize it, and one of them reads whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself quietly, and not in unison with the others, then this is allowed because it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people gather together in one of the houses of Allah and read the Book of Allah, studying it together, but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them and mercy covers them, and Allah mentions them to those who are with Him.” (Reported by Muslim)."

One of the mosques has announced that there will be iftaar for anyone who wants to fast on Thursdays. What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, may Allah preserve him, and he answered as follows:
, Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions. There is nothing wrong with this announcement, because it is a call to good and it does not involve buying or selling. What is haraam is making announcements about buying, selling, leasing and renting, which are things for which mosques are not built, but there is nothing wrong with announcements that call for good, feeding others and acts of charity.
With regard to the question of whether this is a kind of joint worship that is not prescribed in Islam, the fact is that they are not calling for communal fasting, they are just announcing that iftaar is available, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Which takes priority, doing the obligatory (first) Hajj, or paying off one’s father’s debt?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, and he answered as follows:
, Lord of the worlds, and peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions, and upon those who follow them in truth until the Day of Judgement. The obligatory Hajj comes first, because he is not obliged to pay off his father’s debts, but if the father left anything behind, this should be used to pay off the debts. If he did not leave anything, then the matter is up to Allaah. The son should rest assured that if the father took money from people with the intention of paying it back, then Allaah will see to it that it is paid back to the one who lent it, so he should not feel anxious or guilty.

What is the ruling on gathering to recite du`a for completing the Quran, when a person completes reading the Quran and invites the rest of his family and others to come and recite the du`a together so that they may all gain the reward for completing the Quran? The du`a narrated from Shaykh al-Islam Imaam Ahmad Ibn Taymiyah and other du`as are printed at the back of the Mushaf and are called “Du`a Khatam al-Quran al-‘Azeem” (Du`a for completing the Holy Quran). Is it permissible to gather to recite this du`a, whether at the end of Ramadaan or on other occasions? Are such gatherings counted as bid’ah or not? Has any specific du`a for completing the Quran been narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?",,"Praise be to Allah.As far as we know, no specific du`a has been narrated, so it is permissible for a person to recite any du`a he likes and to pray for anything he wishes, such as asking for forgiveness of sins, to be admitted to Paradise, to be saved from Hell, to be given refuge from trials and tribulations, to be helped to understand the Quran in the way that pleases Allah, and to act upon it and memorize it, and so on. It was reported from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he used to gather his family and make du`a when he completed the Quran. However, nothing of this nature was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as far as I know. With regard to the du`a attributed to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), I do not know whether this attribution is correct, but it is well-known among our shaykhs and others even though I have never seen it in any of his books.

1002,3471,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3471,What should a non-Arab do for the adhkar in    salah?,"Question

I have become Muslim, al-hamdu-Lillaah, but I do not know Arabic. What should I do with regard to the adhkar (phrases praising Allah) in the prayer and reading Quran in Arabic?",,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of fuqaha’ say that if the non-Arab can speak Arabic, he should not recite Takbeer (saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”) in any other language. The evidence for this is that the texts instruct this particular wording, which is Arabic, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do it any other way.
But if a non-Arab cannot speak Arabic and is unable to pronounce it, then according to the majority of fuqaha’ it is OK for him to say the Takbeer in his own language after it has been translated from Arabic, according to the statements of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, no matter what the language is. The Takbeer is remembrance or mentioning of Allah, and Allah can be remembered or mentioned in every language, so a language other than Arabic is an alternative, and the person has to learn how to say it in the other language. There is some controversy as to whether all of the adhkar of the prayer, such as tashahhud, qunoot, du`a, and the tasbeehaat in rukoo’ and sujood may be said in languages other than Arabic.
With regard to reading Quran, the majority say that it is not permissible to read it in any language other than Arabic. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran…” [Yoosuf 12:2]
Moreover, the Quran is a miracle in its wording and its meaning; if it is changed, this is no longer the case, and it is no longer Quran but an interpretation (tafseer).
(al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 5: A’jami).
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Section: It is not right to read it in any language other than Arabic, or to substitute other words in Arabic, whether the person can read it well in Arabic or not, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…an Arabic Quran …’ [Yoosuf 12:2] and ‘In the plain Arabic language’ [al-Shu’ara’ 26:195]. The Quran is a miracle in both its wording and its meaning, but if it is changed this is no longer the case, it is not Quran or anything like it. It is only an interpretation (tafseer), and if the interpretation were like the Quran itself, they would not be unable to meet the challenge of producing a soorah like it.
If a person cannot read well in Arabic, he has to learn. If he does not learn when he is able to, his prayers are not valid. If he is not able, or he fears that he does not have time to learn before the time for the next prayer is over, and he knows one aayah of al-Faatihah, he should repeat it seven times… If he can recite more than that, he should repeat it as much as he needs to make his recitation equivalent to the length of Soorat al-Fatihah, or he could make it up by reciting other aayaat. If he knows some aayaat he does not have to repeat, he could recite another aayah instead, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the one who could not recite Quran well to say ‘Al-Hamdu Lillaah (Praise be to Allah)’ and other phrases, which is part of an aayah, but he did not command him to repeat it. If he cannot do anything, but he knows some of the Quran by heart, he should recite whatever he can, and nothing else will do, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood from Rifaa’ah ibn Raafi’, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you get up to pray, if you know some Quran, recite it, otherwise say al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allah), and La ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great).” This is more like Quran, and is more appropriate (than any other words). He should also recite as much as he needs to make it equivalent in length to Soorat al-Faatihah. If he cannot recite anything of the Quran, and cannot learn before it is too late to pray the current prayer, he should say Subhaan Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (Glory be to Allah; praise be to Allah; there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great; and there is no strength and no power except with Allah). Abu Dawood reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “I cannot learn anything of the Quran. Teach me something that will suffice me.” He said, “Say Subhaan Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah.”

1003,3473,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3473,Crossword puzzles,"Question

                What is the ruling on
      crossword puzzles and doing them?",,"Praise be to Allah.Among the many types of intellectual games to
    be found all over daily newspapers and magazines are the type of puzzles called
    crosswords, a kind of puzzle that focuses on how well educated and widely read a person
    is. They cover all branches of knowledge and art, and test how bright and quick-witted a
    person is.
In principle, these puzzles are a form of permissible
    entertainment, but from what we see, many of the words used have evil implications, such
    as the names of artists who are insignificant, morally corrupt or intellectually deviated.
    Or the crosswords expect answers that are of no benefit and are not worth the time and
    effort required to solve the puzzle. In addition, they distract people from reading
    serious and useful material, which is like wasting one’s life in doing something that
    is not useful.
One of the strange things we often see is that readers of
    newspapers and magazines go straight to the puzzles, without looking at other, useful
    information. This love of crossword puzzles could become an addiction, leading people to
    neglect their duties. 
On this basis, many of these puzzles would come under the
    category of makrooh entertainment, provided that the subject matter is not haraam and they
    do not lead to addiction or cause people to neglect their duties. If they do make people
    become negligent and forgetful, then it is more appropriate to say that they are haraam in
    this case.
(Adapted from the book Qadaaya al-Lahw

Muslims who prepare these crossword puzzles
    should try to put useful information in them, and words that will make readers learn

1004,3474,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3474,Is Test-tube Baby Allowed in Islam?,"Question

What is the ruling on so-called test-tube babies?","There are two methods of test-tube babies which are acceptable as a last resort in cases of necessity: 1- When the sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, fertilization is done externally, then the embryo is planted in the womb of the wife. 2- When the sperm of the husband is taken and injected into a suitable place in the cervix or womb of the wife so that fertilization may take place internally.","Praise be to Allah.The issue of test-tube babies has been studied by the Islamic Fiqh Council which issued the following statement:

“One: The following five methods are forbidden according to Shari`ah. They are forbidden either in and of themselves, or because of their consequences such as mixing lineages, not knowing who the child’s mother is, or other reasons that are objectionable according to Shari`ah.


When fertilization takes place between sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is placed in his wife’s womb.
When fertilization takes place between sperm taken from a man who is not the husband, and an egg taken from the wife, then the embryo is placed in the womb of the wife.
When fertilization is done externally between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is placed in the womb of a woman who volunteers to carry it (“surrogate motherhood”).
When fertilization is done externally between the sperm of a man who is not the husband and the egg of a woman who is not the wife, then the embryo is placed in the womb of the wife.
When fertilization is done externally between the sperm and egg of the two spouses, then the embryo is placed in the womb of another wife (of the husband).


Two: The sixth and seventh methods are acceptable as a last resort in cases of necessity, when it is certain that all necessary precautions have been taken. These two methods are:


When the sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, fertilization is done externally, then the embryo is planted in the womb of the wife.
When the sperm of the husband is taken and injected into a suitable place in the cervix or womb of the wife so that fertilization may take place internally.

Other reservations that pose a concern in this matter include: the uncovering of the woman’s `Awrah and most private parts; the possibility of mistakes in the laboratory; the possibility that some weak-minded people in some hospitals may breach their trust and deliberately switch eggs or sperm in order to make the operation a success and earn more material gains. So we have to be extremely cautious when dealing with this matter.”

1006,3476,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3476,How to Do Ruqyah For Yourself,"Question

What are the virtues of a man reciting ruqyah for himself? What is the evidence for that? What should he say when he recites ruqyah for himself?.",You can do ruqyah for yourself and it is a good Sunnah. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself and some of his Companions recited ruqyah for themselves.,"Praise be to Allah.Can you do ruqyah for yourself?
There is nothing wrong with the Muslim reciting ruqyah for himself. That is permissible; indeed it is a good Sunnah, for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself, and some of his Companions recited ruqyah for themselves. 
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ill, he would recite al-Mu'awwidhat over himself and spit drily. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its barakah (blessing).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4728; Muslim, 2192) 
With regard to the hadith narrated by Muslim (220), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described the seventy thousand of this ummah who will enter Paradise without being brought to account or punished, and in which it says: “They are those who did not recite ruqyah or ask for ruqyah to be done , and they did not believe in bad omens and they put their trust in their Lord” – the phrase “they did not recite ruqyah” is the words of the narrator, not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Hence al-Bukhari narrated this hadith (no. 5420) and he did not mention this phrase. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
These people are praised because they did not ask anyone to recite ruqyah for them, and ruqyah is a type of du`a, so they did not ask others to pray for them. The phrase “and they did not recite ruqyah” which is mentioned in the hadith is a mistake (on the part of the narrator), for their ruqyah for themselves and for others is a good deed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself and for others; he did not ask anyone to recite ruqyah for him. His reciting ruqyah for himself and others was like his making du`a for himself and others; this is something that is enjoined, for all the Prophets asked of Allah and prayed to Him, as Allah tells us in the stories of Adam, Ibrahim, Musa and others.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 1/182) 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This phrase is inserted in the hadith, but it is a mistake on the part of some of the narrators. (Hadi al-Arwah, 1/89)
Ruqyah is one of the greatest remedies that the believer should use regularly.  
What du`a to say in ruqyah?
With regard to the du`a that is prescribed for the Muslim to say if he wants to recite ruqyah for himself or for someone else, there are many such du`as, the greatest of which are al-Fatihah and al-Mu'awwidhat.
A group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they came near one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why don’t you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allah. I will perform ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on him and recite Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Alamin. Then he recovered quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong with him. Then they gave them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the Sahabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said, Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” Then he said, “You did the right thing. Share them out, and give me a share.” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2276, and by Muslim, 2201).
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ill, he would recite al-Mu'awwidhat over himself and spit drily. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its barakah (blessing).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4728; Muslim, 2192)
Dua for Ruqyah from the Sunnah
The du`as that have been narrated in the Sunnah include the following:

Muslim (2202) narrated from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-As that he complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about pain that he had felt in his body from the time he had become Muslim. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Put your hand on the part of your body where you feel pain and say ‘Bismillah (in the name of Allah) three times, then say seven times, ‘A’udhu bi ‘izzat-illah wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajid wa uhadhir  (I seek refuge in the glory and power of Allah from the evil of what I feel and worry about).”

Al-Tirmidhi (2080) added: He said, I did that, and Allah took away what I had been suffering, and I kept on enjoining my family and others to do that.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1696)

Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and he would say: “Your father [ meaning Ibrahim, peace be upon him] used to seek refuge with Allah for Isma’il and Ishaq with these words: Audhu bi kalimat Allah al-tammah min kulli shaytanin wa hammah wa min kulli ‘aynin lammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous reptile, and from every evil eye).’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3191)

Shaykh: And they are not at war with the Muslims?
- It is possible that they may be at war with the Muslims in the
    future.

- This questioner says, 'I work in a place where the soldiers are
    not fighting the Muslims. But it is possible that some of the army may be fighting them in

- The questioner is working for the American army, he is a Muslim
    working in America.

    kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you

- Even if you are working for money and not as a volunteer?
Shaykh: Yes, but they are benefitting from it.

In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you sneezes, let him say ‘Al-hamdu Lillaah’ and let his brother or companion say to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah.’ If he says ‘Yarhamuk Allah’ to him, let him say, ‘Yahdikum Allahu wa yusliha baalakum (May Allah guide you and reform your thinking).’”"

                What is the ruling on kissing another
      person's hand?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to kiss the hands of righteous people
    and the greatest scholars, and it is makrooh to kiss the hand of anyone else. The hand of
    the beardless man should not be kissed under any circumstances, 
(From Fatawa al-Imaam al-Nawawi, p. 71)
In the commentary on the book, it says:
If a person wants to kiss another person's hand, if this is because of
    his asceticism, righteousness, knowledge, position or modesty, or other reason that has to
    do with his commitment to religion, then it is not makrooh. In such cases it is mustahabb,
    because Abu Ubaydah kissed the hand of Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them
    both).
But if it is because of the persons riches, wealth, high rank or
    status in the eyes of the people of this world, and so on, then it is intensely makrooh.
Al-Mutawalli, one of our companions, said: It is not permitted, and he
    indicated that it is haraam.
It was narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood that Zaari (may Allaah
    be pleased with him), who was among the delegation of Abd Qays, said: We
    started to get out from our howdahs and we kissed the hands and feet of the Prophet

      fruits of these plants are taken wrongfully during the lifetime of the one who planted
      them, is it better for him to forgive the person who took it, or to leave it as a debt
      owed by that person? If his heir does not forgive that person or accept any compensation,
      and the debt remains until the Day of Resurrection, who will be able to demand it from him

    the time he planted it until the plants die. The heir will have the reward for whatever of
    its fruit is eaten during the time when the plants are under his care, so long as it is
    taken without his objection.
Whatever fruits are taken, it is better to forgive than to leave it as
    a debt. But if he does not forgive, then both the deceased and his heir will be rewarded
    for whatever is eaten, from the time the payment is due until it is finally paid. As for
    demanding restitution on the Day of Resurrection, priority will be given to the rights of
    the one from whom it was taken by force. It was said that it will be given to the final

1017,3491,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3491,Jalsah al-Istiraahah (Sitting for a brief rest during prayer),"Question

What is the ruling on jalsah al-istiraahah?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to have the habit of sitting for a brief rest during prayer, i.e., after the two prostrations of each rak’ah in which one does not recite the Tashahhud immediately after the prostrations. A hadeeth to this effect was reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari. It was also reported in Sunan Abi Dawood and Sunan al-Tirmidhi via different isnaads that are also saheeh. This is the correct view according to scholarly consensus in the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i. Jalsah al-istiraahah is not mustahaab after sajdat al-tilaawah (prostration during recitation of Quran) during prayer. (Words of Imam al-Nawawi).
Jalsah al-istiraahah is a brief pause, sitting for a short while after the second prostration and before standing up. It is Sunnah according to al-Shaafa’i, Ishaaq and Ahmad. It was reported that Abu Qulaabah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith showed us how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed, and when he raised his head from the second prostration in the first rak’ah, he sat and then stood up.” (Reported by all five major scholars of hadeeth apart from Muslim). The wording according to al-Bukhaari was: “When he raised his head from the second prostration, he sat and settled on the ground, then he stood up.”
I say: one of the features of the prayer is jalsah al-istiraahah which should be done after every prostration from which one stands up.
It is not Sunnah to do Jalsah al-Istiraahah after Sajdat al-Tilaawah, or when one is praying sitting down, or in the fourth or second rak’ah of Zuhr, for example, if a person wants to recite Tashahhud. If he does not want to recite it, then it is Sunnah to do Jalsah al-istiraahah.
It is a separation between the two rak`ahs, according to the soundest opinion, it is not a part of either the first rak’ah or the second.
The best is not to make it last longer than a few seconds, because according to the Sunnah, the shorter it is the better, like when one keeps quiet in prayer."

                A graveyard had been endowed for the
      burial of Muslims, and someone built a mosque with a mihrab in it. Is this permissible?
      Should it be knocked down?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for him to do that, and it should
    be knocked down. (Words of Imaam al-Nawawi).
Taking graves as mosques or places of worship is one of the customs of
    the Jews with whom Allaah is angry. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported
    that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: May
    Allaah destroy the Jews! They have taken their graves as places of worship. (Agreed
    upon). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who
    visit graves and those who build mosques over them and place lamps on them. Some of
    them claim that this was because at that time they were still close to the time when
    people had worshipped idols, but Ibn Daqeeq al-Eed refuted this argument. This
    indicates that it is haraam to place lamps on graves because this could lead to false
    beliefs.
    In addition to the issue of building mosques over graves, this person's
    actions also involve going against the conditions set by the one who endowed this land.
    Moreover, he is denying the Muslim dead space in which to be buried. Adding any extra
    structure over a grave as the ignorant people among the Muslims do is haraam, as stated by
    the fuqaha and ulama, let alone building mosques over graves. So the
    imaam (Imaam al-Nawawi) ruled that whatever mosques had been built over the graves should
    be torn down.

                What is the ruling on dyeing a white
      beard?",,"Praise be to Allah.Dyeing it with something reddish or yellowish is Sunnah,
    but dyeing it black is haraam according to the sound opinion, and it was also said that it
    is makrooh. This ban applies to both men and women, except for the man who is engaged in
    jihaad (mujaahid). Al-Maawirdi said: “It is not haraam in his case.” In Saheeh
    Muslim it is reported from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw that the beard of Abu Quhaafah,
    who was the father of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him), was so white,
    he said, “Change this, but avoid black.”
(The above is the words of Imaam al-Nawawi).
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he saw
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) dyeing his beard with a yellowish
    colour. According to another report, he added, “And I would like to do this.”

    upon Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and she brought out some of the hair of
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show us. It was dyed with
    henna and katam.”
Katam is a plant that is mixed with henna, and it is used to dye the
    hair and preserve the colour, as is stated in al-Qaamoos. When katam is used alone,
    not mixed with anything, it produces a reddish-black colour.
Some people have the habit of dyeing their hair pure black at peace
    time (i.e., when not engaged in jihaad). This is not right according to sharee’ah.
    There have been cases where prospective brides and their families have been deceived and
    cheated when a prospective husband has dyed his hair to give the impression of being young
    and strong when in fact he is old and weak."

    fluid is emitted as a result of sexual stimulation.
But this action – when a person excites herself or himself to the

If one has a garden in which vegetables and fruits are grown for his own purpose, is he required to pay 'ushr on its harvest?",,"Praise be to Allah.Zakat is not required on vegetables or fruits, because they are not measured or stored. Zakat is, however, required on fruits that are measured and stored, such as dates, raisins, almonds, pistachios, But if they are not measured and are not stored – such as pomegranates, figs, peaches, melons and other fruits, and tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables – there is no Zakat due for them, because if they are stored they will be spoiled.
 It was reported from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Zakat due on grains or dates unless they reach the amount of five awsuq.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others. This is if they are measurable, so it is more appropriate that no Zakat should be paid on things that are not measured at all.
 It was reported from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib in a marfoo’ report – and some said it was mawqoof – “There is no Zakat due on vegetables.”
 Moreover, neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor his successors (al-Khulafaa’ al-Raashidoon) collected Zakah for fruits and vegetables. Although they were grown in their regions, there was no Zakah paid on them. This indicates that there is no Zakah to be paid for these things.
 And your garden is for your own personal use, not for business purposes, so it is definite that there is no Zakat required for the produce of this garden. But if it is for business purposes, and you keep the profit from it for one complete year, in this case you would have to pay Zakah on the money which you have had for one complete year.

      these people? By only giveing them a brief intro and leaving them as they are? For I read
      that everyone will see Islam at some point in their life. That being the case, if I only
      give someone a brief intro would it be okay?",,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing at all wrong with conveying what you know of the
    religion of Allaah to non-Muslims, as long as you are certain that it is correct, such as
    the basics that you mention, like the five pillars of Islam or the pillars of eemaan
    (faith). Indeed, this is probably obligatory upon you, as Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning): “Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that
    is good (Islam), enjoining al-ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islam
    orders one to do) and forbidding al-munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam
    has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:104]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Convey from me, even an aayah.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Ibn Hajar (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: He said in the hadeeth, “even an aayah”, meaning
    one aayah, as if he was saying that every listener should hasten to convey whatever aayaat
    he heard, even if it is only a few. Some of the Sahaabah set out to call their tribes to
    Islam when they had only a little knowledge that they had gained during the brief time
    they had sat with the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But even
    though their knowledge was so little, it was correct and was blessed, and because of their
    sincerity, Allaah benefitted others through it. Al-Tufayl ibn ‘Umar went from Makkah
    to his people Daws with the limited amount of knowledge that he had, then he came to the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Madeenah accompanied by eighty
    families of Daws, all of whom had become Muslim, and among whom was Abu Hurayrah (may
    Allaah be pleased with him).
Know that some non-Muslims may become Muslim for the slightest reason
    and by hearing the briefest word said to them. Do not think that the knowledge you have is
    too little for the purposes of conveying the Message. “… invite them to your
    Lord. Verily! You indeed are on the (true) straight guidance.” [al-Hajj 22:67 –

    liquor store so that he can buy something from there. Some passengers also ask him to take
    them to places such as nightclubs. Is it permissible for him to work in this occupation or
    to accept these fares?
The shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, replied as follows:
No, it is not permissible for him to stop at the liquor store for his
    passenger to buy some, and it is not permissible for him to take anyone to forbidden
    clubs, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  Help you one

Secondly, if the pregnancy and birth happened before the marriage

“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [An-Nur 24:30-31]
Since lowering the gaze is the basis of protecting the private parts, it is mentioned first. Allah has made the eyes the reflection of the heart: if a person lowers his gaze, the desire in his heart will be reduced, but if a person looks and stares, the desire in his heart will be provoked.
Muslim narrated (1218) that Al-Fadl ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was riding behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Sacrifice (Yawm An-Nahr) from Muzdalifah to Mina, when some women riding on camel-borne sedan chairs passed by. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned his [Al-Fadl’s] head away. This was prevention and denunciation through action, for if looking were permissible he would have approved of what he did.
Al-Bukhari narrated (6343) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam has his share of Zina decreed for him, and he will undoubtedly get his share. The eye commits Zina and its Zina is looking. The tongue commits Zina and its Zina is speaking; the feet commit Zina and their Zina is walking; the hands commit Zina and their Zina is touching. The heart longs and desires for something and the private parts confirm that or deny it.”
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began by mentioning the eye because this is how the Zina of the hand, foot, heart and private parts begins. By mentioning the Zina of the tongue, he pointed out that the mouth can commit Zina by speaking. And he stated that the private parts can confirm that, if they make the deed (Zina) happen, or deny it if that does not happen.
This Hadith gives the clearest indication that the eye can sin by looking and that this is its Zina. This is a refutation to those who say that looking is allowed in all circumstances.
It was also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O `Ali, do not follow a look with a second, for the first [unintended] look is allowable but not the second.”
A look has the same effect on the heart as an arrow has on its victim. If it does not kill him, it will wound him. It is like a spark of fire in dried grass; if it does not burn all of it, it will still burn some of it. May Allah have mercy on the one who said:
“Everything starts with a look, and big fires start from little sparks.
How often has a heart been dealt a fatal blow like that of an arrow, with no need for a bow.
As long as a man’s eyes are looking around, looking into the eyes of others, he is in a state of danger.
His eye delights in that which could destroy his heart. The joy that may lead to harm is not welcome.”
Hence Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fatawa 3/227:
“With regard to television , it is a dangerous device and its harmful effects are very great, like those of the cinema, or even worse. We know from the research that has been written about it and from the words of experts in Arab countries and elsewhere enough to indicate that it is dangerous and very harmful to Islamic beliefs (`Aqidah), morals and the state of society. This is because it includes the presentation of bad morals, tempting scenes, immoral pictures, semi-nakedness, destructive speech, and disbelief . It encourages imitation of their conduct and ways of dressing, respect for their leaders, neglect of Islamic conduct and ways of dressing, and looking down on the scholars and heroes of Islam. 
It damages their image by portraying them in an off-putting manner that makes people despise them and ignore them. It shows people how to cheat, steal, hatch plots and commit acts of violence against others. 
Undoubtedly, anything that produces so many bad results should be stopped and shunned, and we have to close all the doors that could lead to it. If some of our brothers denounce it and speak out against it, we cannot blame them, because this is a part of sincerity towards Allah and towards other people.
Whoever thinks that this device (TV) can be free of these evils and can be used only for good purposes if it is censored properly is exaggerating and is making a big mistake, because the censor may miss things and most people nowadays want to imitate the foreigners. It is very rare to find censors who are doing their job properly, especially nowadays when most people are only interested in time-wasting entertainment and things that turn people away from true guidance. Reality bears witness to that.”
We ask Allah to keep us safe from all evil for He is the Most Generous.
And Allah knows best."

It is not permissible for us to help the enemies of Allaah with

I would like to know why men aren't allowed to wear silk, but in Paradise they will?","It should be known that Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, is Wise in His commands and prohibitions. He does not command anything except that which is in peoples’ best interests and He does not forbid anything except that which is harmful.","Praise be to Allah.Wisdom behind prohibitions in Islam
It should be known that Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, is Wise in His commands and prohibitions. He does not command anything except that which is in peoples’ best interests and He does not forbid anything except that which is harmful.
People may or may not come to understand the reasons behind these commands and prohibitions , although Allah has His Wisdom in any given issue. 
Having said that, it is still not right to make following a command or prohibition dependent upon knowing the wisdom behind it; rather we should hasten to carry out the commands of the Shari`ah, regardless of whether the wisdom behind it is clear to us or not. If it is clear, then praise be to Allah, and if it is not, then the Muslim should not let the fact that he does not know it prevent him from acting in accordance with the ruling of the Shari`ah. 
This is true submission to the command of Allah, and Islam means submission to Allah, may He be exalted, and obeying Him. If a person makes his actions dependent on understanding matters which may or may not convince him, he is in effect following his own thoughts and desires, not his Lord and Master.
The above does not mean that it is not important to look for the wisdom behind the rules of the Shari`ah, or that doing so is forbidden, but we should not make knowing the reasons a condition for acting upon the ruling.
Is there a connection between things prohibited in this world and those allowed in the Hereafter?
There is no connection between things that are prohibited in this world and those that are allowed in the Hereafter. It is not correct to think of the Hereafter as being like this world; each realm has its own rules and laws.
It is not correct to suggest that something is permitted in this world on the basis that it is permitted in Paradise or in the Hereafter , otherwise we would end up allowing things that we know from the basics of Islam are forbidden , such as drinking wine, taking more than four wives, singing etc. On this basis, the confusion reflected in the question about silk being forbidden in this world although it is permitted in Paradise should be cleared up.
Why is silk haram for men?
The scholars have discussed the reasons for silk being forbidden for men in this world. For example, al-’Allamah Ibn al-Qayyim suggested in his brilliant work Zad al-Ma'ad that
“Among those who believe that there is reason and wisdom (behind the rulings of Islam) and they are the majority are some who answer that Islam has forbidden it so that people will keep away from it and give it up for the sake of Allah, so they will be rewarded for that. 
Others reply that it was basically created for women, as is the case with gold jewellery, so it was forbidden for men because it can corrupt them by making them resemble women. 
Some of them said that silk was forbidden for men because of what it may lead to in the way of pride, showing off and self-admiration. 
Some of them said that silk was forbidden for men because when it touches the body, it makes a man effeminate and goes against his masculinity and manliness, so if he wears it his heart gains the characteristics of femininity and softness, as is obvious, even if he was the most masculine and chivalrous of men.
There is no doubt that wearing silk will diminish these manly characteristics, if not take them away altogether. Whoever is too dense to understand this should just submit to the Wise Lawmaker.” (Zad al-Ma`ad, 4/80)

                If one has a student loan with riba that was taken before accepting Islam, is he/she obligated to repay this loan since riba is involved? JazakAllahu khairan.",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may
    Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
It was reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) addressed the people on the day of ‘Arafaah, and said: “The riba of
    the Jaahiliyyah is cancelled.” This was in spite of the fact that these contracts had
    been made during the time of Jaahiliyyah and before the ruling on riba was established. If
    it is possible for him not to pay the interest on the loan, then he should not pay it, but
    he should not make a gain twice. The Muslim judge or leader should take the amount he was
    supposed to pay in riba and give it in charity or put it in the bayl al-maal (Islamic
    treasury). 
Question:
You said, “he should not make a gain twice.” What does this
    mean?
Answer:
The first gain was when he benefitted from the money that he took from
    the bank, for example. The second gain is the interest which, if he does not pay it to the
    bank, he will have made a second gain… But still, he should not pay it to the one who
    loaned him the money on the basis of interest. For example, if he borrowed a million and
    owes interest of one hundred thousand, do we say pay back the million and keep the hundred
    thousand? No, we say pay back the million but do not give the hundred thousand to the
    usurer, and do not keep it for yourself as a profit or gain… Put it in the bayt
    al-maal or give it in charity. And Allaah knows best."

    be part of the Sunnah of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is
    not right to say that you want to make some changes to it, because it is right and proper
    in and of itself. But the reason behind your question seems to be that you want to keep
    from doing it openly in front of some people for a specific purpose, or to avoid a
    specific evil.
Secondly, talking about Tawheed and basic matters of aqeedah and
    teaching people about these things among the people you describe, is undoubtedly more
    important. Tawheed is the key to the call of the Messengers (peace be upon them) and the
    first duty of the one who is accountable. It is the condition for all other deeds to be
    accepted. If it is clear to you, or you believe it to be most likely that adhering to some

    cause you trouble, or damage your reputation so that people are put off you and do not
    listen to you, or distract the people you are addressing from what is more important, then
    there is nothing wrong with not doing it for this reason in these circumstances. Allaah

    best of those who give provision. “And no moving (living) creature is there on
    earth but its provision is due from Allaah” [Hood 11:6 – interpretation of the
    meaning]. The rizq (provision) of Allaah will not be brought by the carefulness of the
    miser, nor will it be prevented by the hostility of one who does not want it to come to
    another. It is part of the Wisdom of Allaah that He differentiates between His slaves in
    their provision just as He differentiates between them in their physical creation and
    their attitudes. So He gives in abundance to whomever He wills and gives little to
    whomever He wills. He may give plenty to some people and little to others. He is the One
    Who guarantees the provision of His slaves according to His prior knowledge and decree.
    Allaah knows and decrees that some of His slaves will be given plenty and some will be
    given little; He has reasons for that that are beyond our comprehension. In His wisdom, He
    gives plenty or gives little as a test for His slaves, testing them with blessings or with
    calamities, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with
    good” [al-Anbiya’ 21:35]
Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning):
“But when He tries him be straitening his means of
    life, he says: ‘My Lord has humiliated me!” [al-Fajr 89:16]
But then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Nay!”
    [al-Fajr 89:16], meaning, it is not as he thinks; Allaah blesses whoever he wills and
    makes things difficult for whomever He wills, and this is a test, not a sign of honour or
    humiliation. By means of this test, it becomes apparent who is grateful and patient, and
    who is the opposite. And Allaah is the Knower of all things."

When I was a youngster I was sent to a Boarding School and
did hifz for a while. I left the hifz classes after completing four paras (juz). This was due to the fact that I could not manage school & hifz at the same time. I was 12-13 years old at the time and not baaligh yet.
Is it a sin that I have now, almost 20 years later, forgotten the 4 paras (juz)? People have said it is a very great sin and that I should learn and memorize it again? 
I am confused. Please help!",,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly forgetfulness is something that is natural in man, and man is only called insaan because of his forgetfulness (nasiy). Usually this varies from one person to another, according to the differences in the strength of the memory that Allaah has created in His slaves.
 The Qur’aan “escapes” from the heart if the Muslim does not constantly and regularly review what he has memorized of it.
 The reason for this may be that it is a test of people’s hearts, to show the difference between the one whose heart is attached to the Qur’aan and regularly recites it, and the one whose heart is attached to it only whilst memorizing it, then he loses interest and forgets it.
 The reason may also be to give the Muslim a stronger motive to recite the Qur’aan more frequently so as to attain the immense reward for every letter that he recites. If it were the case that he could learn it and never forget it, he would not need to read it frequently and then he would miss out on the reward for reciting and reviewing it regularly. Fear of forgetting it will make you keen to recite it so as to gain more reward with your Lord. For every letter you recite you will have one hasanah, and the reward for one hasanah is ten like it.
 The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to read Qur’aan regularly lest we forget it. He warned us against being negligent in this regard, as was stated in numerous ahaadeeth, including the following:
 1-The hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the one who memorizes the Qur’aan is that of the owner of a hobbled camel. If he tends to it regularly, he will keep it, but if he lets it go, he will lose it.” (al-Bukhaari, 5031).
 It is well known that if a camel escapes and runs away, it cannot be recaptured except with a lot of stress and difficulty. Similarly, if the person who memorizes Qur’aan does not regularly review what he has memorized, he will lose it and will require a great deal of effort to get it back.
 * Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (9/79), in his commentary on this hadeeth: so long as one constantly reviews it, what one has memorized will remain, as is the case with a camel, if it remains hobbled, you will keep it. The camel was singled out here because it is the most likely of domesticated animals to run away, and if it does run away, recapturing it is very difficult.
 2 – Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (no. 790 and 791) from Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Read this Qur’aan regularly for, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, it is more likely to escape than a hobbled camel.”
 3 – Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not right for any one of you to say, ‘I have forgotten such and such.’ On the contrary, he has been made to forget. Try to review the Qur’aan, for it is more likely to escape from men’s hearts than camels.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 5032).
 Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (9/81): Ibn Battaal said, This hadeeth is in accordance with the two aayahs (interpretation of the meanings):
‘Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word’ [al-Muzzammil 73:5]
and
‘And We have indeed made the Qur’ân easy to understand and remember’ [al-Qamar 54:17]
 So whoever strives to memorize it and recite it regularly, it will be made easy for him, and whoever turns away from it, will lose it.
 This is what encourages us to constantly review what we have memorized and to keep on reciting it, lest we forget it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave this example because it is the best way to explain what he meant. He also confirmed it with his oath ‘by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad’, to affirm the importance of constantly reciting the Qur’aan and reviewing what one has learned.
 3 – With regard to the report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The sins of my ummah were shown to me and there is no sin greater than that of a man who was given or was helped to memorize a soorah or an aayah of the Qur’aan and then he forgot it.” This is a weak (da’eef) hadeeth which was classed as such by al-Bukhaari and al-Tirmidhi. See Takhreej Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh by al-Albaani, no. 720.
 Imaam Ibn al-Munaadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Mutashaabih al-Qur’aan (p. 52):
 The Salaf were always afraid of forgetting Qur’aan after they had memorized it, because this was a shortcoming.
 Al-Suyooti said in al-Itqaan (1/106):
 Forgetting it is a major sin, as was stated by al-Nawawi in al-Rawdah and others, because of the hadeeth “I was shown the sins of my ummah…”
 One of the best ways to help oneself to remember what one has memorized and to make it firmly-entrenched is to recite it in one’s salaah, especially in Qiyaam al-Layl. The Salaf used to recite it during the day and when praying Qiyaam al-Layl.
 If you strive hard to review the Qur’aan regularly, there will be no sin on you even if you do forget some of it. The blame is on those who neglect it and fail to review it and read it regularly. We ask Allaah to forgive us.
 O Allaah, make the Qur’aan the life of my heart, the light of my breast, a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety. O Allaah, teach us from it that which we do not know and remind us from it of that which we have forgotten, for You are the All-Hearing, All-Knowing."

                A patron at our library has asked for the
      architecture and history of the Great Mosque in Mecca known as Masjid Al Haram.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Masjid al-Haraam (the Sacred Mosque) is situated in Makkah, a city
    in the Arabian Peninsula 330 meters above sea-level. The history of the mosque goes back
    to its founding at the time of Ibraaheem (Abraham) and his son Ismaa’eel (Ishmael),
    peace be upon them both. Makkah is the place where the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born and where the Revelation began, and from
    which the light of Islam spread. Al-Masjid al-Haraam is located here. This is the first
    mosque that was built for people on earth, as Allaah says in the Qur’aan
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was
    that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for al-‘aalameen (mankind
    and jinns).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:96].  
It was reported in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Dharr said: “I
    asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the first
    mosque to be built for people on earth. He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Haraam.’ I asked,
    ‘Then which?’ He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Aqsaa [The Furthest Mosque, in
    Jerusalem].’ I asked, ‘How long between them?’ He said, ‘Forty
    years.’” 
The Ka’bah – which is the direction of prayer for all Muslims
    throughout the world – is situated roughly in the middle of al-Masjid al-Haraam. It
    is a 15-meter high stone structure more or less in the shape of a cube. It was built by
    Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) on the command of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning): 
“And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the
    (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): ‘Associate not anything (in
    worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who bow
    and make prostration.” [al-Hajj 22:26] 
The word “bawwa’naa” [translated here as “We
    showed”] means “He guided him and gave him permission to build it.” (Tafseer
    Ibn Katheer). 
    Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaa’eel
    were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah)…”
    [al-Baqarah 2:127] 
Wahb ibn Munbih said: “… It was built by Ibraaheem, then
    [rebuilt] by the Amalekites, then by Jurham, then by Qusayy ibn Kilaab. Its rebuilding by
    Quraysh is well known… They began to rebuild it with the stones of the valley, which
    Quraysh carried on their shoulders, and they built it up, 20 cubits high… Between the
    rebuilding of the Ka’bah and the beginning of the Revelation there were five years,
    and between the rebuilding and the Hijrah there were fifteen years. ‘Abd al-Razzaaq
    reported from Mu’ammar from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Uthmaan from
    Abu’l-Tufayl, and from Mu’ammar from al-Zuhri: ‘They were building it and
    when they reached al-Rukn, Quraysh argued about which tribe should lift it up. Then they
    said, “Let us ask the first person who comes from this direction to judge between
    us.” They agreed on that, then the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) came to them, and he was a young man wearing a spotted sash. They
    asked him to judge between them, and he told them to place al-Rukn on a piece of cloth,
    then he told the chief of every tribe to hold the edge of the cloth, then he climbed up
    and they lifted al-Rukn up to him, and he himself 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) put it into its place.” (Taareekh Makkah by al-Azraqi, 1/161-164) 
    Muslim (2374) reported that ‘Aa’ishah said:
    “I asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about
    al-Jadr [the wall] and whether it was part of the House [the Ka’bah]. He said,
    ‘Yes.’ I asked, ‘So why is it not incorporated into the House?’ He
    said, ‘Your people ran out of money.’ I asked, ‘What about the door? Why is
    it high up?’ He said, ‘Your people did that so they could let in whomever they
    wanted and keep out whomever they wanted. If it were not for the fact that your people are
    still new [in Islam] and too close to their Jaahiliyyah, and I am afraid that they would
    resent it, I would think of incorporating al-Jadr into the House and bringing the door
    down to ground level.’” 
Before Islam (in the year in which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) was born), the Ka’bah was subjected to an attack by the Ethiopian
    Abrahah, who had built al-Qulays, a church to which he wanted the Arabs to make their
    pilgrimage. He set out with his army, with whom was the elephant, and when they reached
    Makkah, Allaah sent flocks of birds against them; each bird was carrying three stones like
    chickpeas or lentils, one in its beak and two in its claws. Every man who was struck by a
    stone was killed, so the army was destroyed, by the command of Allaah. 
Allaah has mentioned this incident in His Book, where He says
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the
    Elephant? Did He not make their plot go astray?
And sent against them birds, in flocks, 
Striking them with stones of Sijjeel,
And made them like an empty field of slaks (in which the corn has been
    eaten up by cattle).” [al-Feel 105:1-5]
(See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah by Ibn Hishaam,
    1/44-58). 
There was no fence or wall around the Ka’bah until
    it became necessary. Yaaqoot al-Hamawi said in Mu’jam al-Buldaan (5/146):
    “The first one to build a wall around the Ka’bah was ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab
    (may Allaah be pleased with him); there was no wall around it during the time of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or Abu Bakr. [The wall was built]
    because people were building their houses too close to the Ka’bah and making the
    space around it too small for people. ‘Umar said: ‘The Ka’bah is the House
    of Allaah, and a house needs a courtyard. You have encroached on its space, it has not
    encroached on yours.’ So he bought those houses, demolished them and added that space
    to the space around the Ka’bah. He also destroyed the houses of people in the
    vicinity of the Ka’bah who had refused to sell, and kept the money aside for them
    until they came and took it later on. He built a wall around the mosque, lower than the
    height of a man, and lamps were placed on it. When ‘Uthmaan was khaleefah, he bought
    more houses that were more expensive… It was said that ‘Uthmaan was the first
    one to build porticos around it … When Ibn al-Zubayr was in power, he improved its
    appearance, although he did not increase its size, by adding marble pillars, extra doors
    and other improvements. When ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan was khaleefah, he added to the
    wall of the mosque, and brought columns from Egypt by sea to Jeddah, which were carried
    from Jeddah to Makkah on wheels. Al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf commanded that the Ka’bah
    should be covered in drapes (al-kiswah) and when al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik was
    khaleefah, he added to the adornment of the kiswah and spent money on improvements to the
    drainage spout and roof… When al-Mansoor and his son al-Mahdi were khaleefahs, they
    added more adornments to the mosque and improved its appearance.” 
There are also other religious monuments in the Mosque, such as Maqaam
    Ibraaheem (the Station of Ibraaheem), which is the rock on which Ibraaheem (peace be upon
    him) stood whilst he was building the Ka’bah. There is also the Well of Zamzam, which
    is a spring of water brought forth by Allaah for Haajar and her child Ismaa’eel
    (peace be upon him) when he got thirsty. We should not forget either the Black Stone and
    al-Rukn al-Yamaani, which are two of the precious stones of Paradise. Al-Tirmidhi and
    Ahmad reported that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “I heard the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying that the Rukn and the Maqaam
    are two of the precious stones of Paradise, whose light has been extinguished by Allaah.
    If He had not extinguished their light, it would illuminate everything between the East
    and the West.” (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 804). 
    Near the Mosque are the two hills of al-Safa and
    al-Marwah. One of the unique features of the Mosque is that it is the only mosque in the
    world to which people come on pilgrimage (Hajj). Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning): 
“Verily! Al-Safa and al-Marwah are of the Symbols of Allaah. So
    it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House to
    perform the going (tawaaf) between them. And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily,
    Allaah is All-Recognizer, All-Knower.” [al-Baqarah 2:158] 
Another of its unique features is that Allaah has made it safe, and
    one prayer in it is equal to a hundred thousand prayers elsewhere. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when We made the House a place of resort for
    mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqaam (place) of Ibraaheem as a
    place of prayer, and We commanded Ibraaheem and Ismaa’eel that they should purify My
    House for those who are circumabulating it, or staying (I’tikaaf), or bowing or
    prostrating themselves.” [al-Baqarah 2:125] 
“In it are manifest signs (for example); the maqaam (place) of
    Ibraaheem; whoever enters it, he attains security. And Hajj to the House is a duty that
    mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance,
    provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e., denies Hajj, then he is a
    disbeliever of Allaah], then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘aalameen
    (mankind and jinns).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
(See Akhbaar Makkah by al-Azraqi and Akhbaar Makkah
    by al-Faakihi).
And Allaah is the Source of Strength and the Guide to the Straight
    Path."
1042,3749,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3749,Ways to Help Oneself Pray Qiyam al-Layl,"Question

What are some ways that help to pray Qiyam Allayl or tahajjud (late night voluntary prayers)?",,"Praise be to Allah.There are many things that one can do to help oneself pray qiyam al-layl, among which are the following:
1 Being sincere towards Allah, as He has commanded us to be sincere towards Him and none other in our deeds. He tells us (interpretation of the meaning): And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone [al-Bayyinah 98:5]. The more sincere a person is towards Allah, the more he will be guided and helped to obey Allah and draw closer to Him. Ubayy ibn Kab (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Give glad tidings to this ummah (nation/community)of splendour, religion, high rank, victory and prevalence on earth. Whoever does the deeds of the Hereafter to gain some worldly benefit, will have no share of the Hereafter. (Reported by Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 2825). Mutarraf ibn Abd-Allah ibn al-Shakheer said: The goodness of a deed is related to the goodness of the heart, and the goodness of the heart is related to the goodness of the intention. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The degree to which a person is helped and aided by Allah depends on the degree of his intention, drive, aim and hopes. Help from Allah comes to people in proportion to their drive, intention, hopes and fears, and failure comes to them in like manner.
Therefore the salaf (pious predecessors) were very keen to conceal their acts of worship such as qiyam al-layl. A man asked Tameem ibn Aws al-Daari (may Allah be pleased with him), How do you pray at night? He got very angry and said, By Allah, one rakah that I pray in secret in the small hours of the night is more beloved to me than praying the whole night long and then telling people about it. Ayyoob al-Sakhtiyaani used to spend the entire night in prayer, then when dawn approached, he would go back to bed and lie down, and when dawn came, he would raise his voice as if he had just woken up.
2 The person who wants to pray qiyam al-layl should realize that Allah is calling him to qiyam. When the slave realizes that his Master, Who has no need of peoples worship, is calling him to do this, he will respond. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you wrapped in your garments (i.e., Prophet Muhammad)! Stand (to pray) all night, except a little. Half of it, or a little less than that, or a little more; and recite the Quraan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style. [al-Muzzammil 73:1-4].
Sad ibn Hishaam ibn Aamir said to Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her): Tell me about how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed qiyam. She said: Have you not read Yaa ayyuhal-muzzammil (O you wrapped in your garments!)? He said, Of course. She said: Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, made qiyaam obligatory at the beginning of this soorah, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions prayed qiyaam for a year, and Allah withheld the end of this soorah for twelve months, until He revealed something at the end of this soorah to make things easier, so qiyaam al-layl became voluntary after it had been obligatory. (Reported by Muslim).
3 Knowing the virtues of qiyam al-layl. Whoever knows the virtues of this act of worship will be keen to talk to Allah, may He be exalted, and to stand before Him at that time. Among the reports that describe the virtues of this act of worship is the hadeeth (narration)of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The best of prayers after the prescribed prayers is prayer in the depths of the night, and the best of fasting after the month of Ramadaan is fasting the month of Allah, Muharram. (reported by Muslim).
Abd-Allah ibn Amr (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The most beloved of prayer to Allah is the prayer of Dawood, and the most beloved of fasts to Allah is the fast of Dawood. He used to sleep for half of the night, then get up and pray for a third of the night, then sleep for a sixth of the night, and he used to fast every other day. (Agreed upon).
Amr ibn Absah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The closest that the Lord is to His slave is in the later part of the night, so if you can be one of those who remember Allah at that time, then do so. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa'i).
According to a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Our Lord admires two men: a man who leaves his mattress and cover, and slips away from his wife and lover, to go and pray. Allah says, O My angels, look at My slave. He has left his mattress and cover and slipped away from his lover and wife to pray, out of hope for what is with Me and out of fear of what is with Me. (Reported by Ahmad. It is a hasan (sound) report. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 258).
Qiyam al-Layl expels forgetfulness from the heart, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by Abd-Allah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allah be pleased with them both), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites ten aayaat (verses)in qiyaam will not be recorded as one of the forgetful. Whoever recites a hundred aayaat in qiyaam will be recorded as one of the devout , and whoever prays a thousand aayaat in qiyaam will be recorded as one of the muqantareen (those who pile up good deeds). (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ibn Hibbaan. It is a hasan report. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 635).
Yahyaa ibn Muaadh said: The medicine of the heart is five things: reading Quraan and pondering the meaning, having an empty stomach, praying at night (qiyam al-layl), beseeching Allah at the time of suhoor, and keeping company with righteous people.
4 Studying how the salaf and righteous people practised qiyam al-layl and adhered to it. The salaf used to enjoy qiyam al-layl and rejoice greatly in doing it. Abd-Allah ibn Wahb said: Every type of pleasure is enjoyed only once, except for acts of worship, which are enjoyed three times: when you do it, when you remember it, and when you are given the reward for it.
Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: There is nothing left of the joys of this life except three: qiyam al-layl, meeting ones brothers in faith, and praying in congregation.
Thaabit al-Banaani said: There is nothing I enjoy more than qiyam al-layl.
Yazeed al-Riqaashi said: A lot of tahajjud brings delight to the worshippers, and a lot of thirst (i.e., fasting), brings joy when they meet Allah.
Mukhallad ibn Husayn said: I never woke up at night except I saw Ibraaheem ibn Adham remembering Allah and praying, and this made me depressed, so I consoled myself with this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He pleases. And Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty [al-Hadeed 57:21].
Abu Aasim al-Nabeel said: Abu Haneefah used to be called al-Watad (pole or pillar) because he prayed so much.
Al-Qaasim ibn Maeen said: Abu Haneefah spent an entire night in qiyam reciting this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter [al-Qamar 54:46], repeating it and weeping, beseeching Allah until morning came.
Ibraaheem ibn Shammaas said: I used to see Ahmad ibn Hanbal staying up at night to pray when he was a young man.
Abu Bakr al-Marwadhi said: I was with Imaam Ahmad for nearly four months in the army, and he never stopped praying qiyam at night or reading Quraan during the day, and I never knew when he completed the Quraan, because he kept that secret.
Imaam al-Bukhaari used to pray qiyam and tahajjud at night until the time of suhoor, and he would read between a half and a third of the Quraan, and complete it at suhoor every third night.
Al-Allaamah Ibn Abd al-Haadi said, describing the qiyam of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah: At night he would keep away from people, and spend that time only with his Lord, beseeching Him continually and reciting Quraan, repeating different kinds of acts of worship by night and by day. When he began to pray, his body would start to tremble, leaning to the left and right.
Ibn Rajab said concerning his shaykh Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim: He was a man of worship, tahajjud and lengthy prayers. I have never seen his equal in worship and knowledge of the Quraan, hadeeth and principles of faith.
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said, describing his shaykh al-Haafiz al-Iraaqi: I stayed with him, and I never saw him forsake qiyam al-layl: it was like a habit for him.
5 Sleeping on ones right side. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught his ummah (followers)to sleep on their right sides, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you goes to bed, let him clear his bed by hitting it with his garment, for he does not know what may have come onto it. Then let him lie down on his right side, then let him say, Bismika Rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu. In amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa fahfazhaa bimaa tahfazu bihi ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your Name, my Lord, I lay myself down and I get up again. If You take my soul, then have mercy on it, and if You send it back to me, then protect it with that with which You protect Your righteous slaves). (Agreed upon).
Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When you want to go to bed, do wudoo as for prayer, then lie down on your right side. (Agreed upon)
Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would put his right hand under his right cheek. (Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4523).
Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is a reason for his lying on his right side, which is that the heart is located on the left, so if a person lays on his left side, he will sleep too deeply, because the hearts position will be too comfortable, but if he sleeps on his right side, he will not be too settled, so he wont sleep deeply.
6 Sleeping in a state of tahaarah (purity). We have already quoted the hadeeth of al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When you go to bed, do wudoo as if for prayer. (Agreed upon).
Muaad ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There is no Muslim who goes to sleep remembering Allah and in a state of purity, and when he turns over he asks Allah for good in this world and the next, but it will be given to him. (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5754).
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Purify these bodies and Allah will purify you, for there is no slave who goes to sleep in a state of purity but an angel spends the night with him, and every time he turns over, [the angel] says, O Allah, forgive Your slave, for he went to bed in a state of purity. (Reported by al-Tabaraani. Al-Mundhiri said, its isnaad is jaayid. Saheeh al-Jaami, 3831).
7 Going to sleep early. Sleeping straight after Ishaa is the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and a good and healthy habit. One of the ahaadeeth that describe its virtues was narrated by Abu Barzah al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to prefer to delay Ishaa, and he did not like to sleep before it or talk after it. (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar reported that al-Qaadi Ayaad said, concerning the phrase He did not like to sleep before it: Because that could lead to one praying it too late, or delaying it until after the preferred time, and talking after it could lead to one sleeping before Fajr and missing it, or missing qiyam al-layl.
Ibn Raafi said: Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) used to wave his stick at the people when darkness fell, and would say, Get up and go, may Allah help you to pray qiyam at night!
Another matter that has to do with sleep is choosing a suitable bed, not one that is excessively luxurious or soft, because that makes a person sleep too much and become negligent, and causes laziness and carelessness. Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The pillow of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on which he slept at night was made of leather stuffed with palm fibres. (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 4714).
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that Umar ibn al-Khattaab entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was lying on a mat of palm fibres that had left marks on his side. Umar said, O Messenger of Allah, why do you not get something more comfortable than this? He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: What do I have to do with this world? My relationship with this world is like that of a traveller on a hot summers day, who seeks shade under a tree for an hour, then moves on. (Reported by Ahmad and al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5545).
Ali ibn Bakkaar (may Allah have mercy on him) used to have a slave-woman who would spread out his bed for him, and he would touch it with his hand and say: By Allah, you are good, and by Allah you are cool, but by Allah I will not rest on you tonight. Then he would get up and pray qiyam until Fajr.
Also, one should not sleep too much or too deeply. Ibraaheem ibn Adham said: If you are sleeping at night, and running about during the day, and always committing sin, how can you earn the pleasure of the One Who is directing your affairs?
8 Having the habit of reciting adhkaar (words of remembrance of Allah) prescribed by shareeah (Islamic law) before going to sleep, because these adhkaar are like a fortress which protects a person from the Shaytaan, by the permission of Allah, and helps him to get up for qiyam. Among these adhkaar is that mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you goes to bed, let him clear his bed by hitting it with his garment, for he does not know what may have come onto it. Then let him lie down on his right side, then let him say, Bismika Rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu. In amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa fahfazhaa bimaa tahfazu bihi ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your Name, my Lord, I lay myself down and I get up again. If You take my soul, then have mercy on it, and if You send it back to me, then protect it with that with which You protect Your righteous slaves). (Agreed upon).
Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed each night, he would put his palms together, blow in them, and recite Qul huwa Allahu ahad, Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Falaq and Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Naas, then he would wipe as much of his body as he could with his hands, starting with his head and face, and the front of his body, doing this three times. (Agreed upon).
Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah, this will take care of him. (Agreed upon).
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi atamanaa wa saqaanaa, wa kafaanaa fa kam mimman laa kaafeeya lahu wa laa muweeya lahu (Praise be to Allah Who has fed us and given us to drink, and Who has given us enough, for how many are there who have no-one to suffice them or give them refuge). (Reported by Muslim).
According to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah in which he tells the story of how he captured the Shaytaan, the Shaytaan said to him: When you go to bed, recite Aayat al-Kursi, Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists [al-Baqarah 2:255 interpretation of the meaning] until the end of it, because it will bring Allahs protection for you, and no shaytaan (devil) will approach you until morning comes. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned this to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said, He spoke the truth even though he is a liar. (Agreed upon).
Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophets daughter Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) came to him and asked him for a servant, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her and Ali: Shall I not teach you something that will be better for you than a servant? When you go to bed, say Subhaan Allah thirty-three times, al-hamdu Lillaah thirty-three times, and Allahu akbar thirty-four times. This is better for you than a servant. (Agreed upon).
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Recite Qul yaa ayyuhal-kaafiroon when you go to sleep, for it is a renunciation of shirk. (polytheism) (Reported by al-Bayhaqi. Saheeh al-Jaami, 1172).
Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would put his right hand under his right cheek and say: Rabbi qinee adhaabaka yawma tabathu ibaadaka (My Lord, save me from Your punishment on the Day when You resurrect Your slaves). (Reported by Abu Dawood, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4532).
Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When you go to bed, do wudoo as if for prayer, then lie down on your right side, then say: Allahummah aslamtu nafsi ilayk, wa wajahtu wajhi ilayk, wa fawwadtu amri ilayk, wa aljatu zahri ilayk, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayk, laa maljaa wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayk. Aamantu bi kitaabik alladhi anzalt, wa bi nabiyyik alladhi arsalt (O Allah, I submit myself to You, I turn my face to You, I delegate my affairs to You and I rely totally on You, out of fear and hope of You. There is no refuge or sanctuary from You except in You. I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent). Then if you die, you will have died on the fitrah, (natural state) , so make these the last words you speak.” (Agreed upon).
Similarly, the Muslim should have the habit of reciting adhkaar prescribed by shareeah when waking up, such as that reported by Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you wakes up, he should say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi radda alayya roohi, wa aafaani fi jasadi wa adhina li bi dhikrihi (Praise be to Allah Who has restored my soul, given health to my body, and allowed me to remember Him). (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa'i, Saheeh al-Jaami, 326).
Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever turns over at night and says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa al kulli shayin qadeer. Al-hamdulillahi, subhaan Allah wa laa illaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and the Praise, and He is Able to do all things. Praise be to Allah, glory be to Allah. There is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great and there is no strength and no power except in Allah), then says, Allahumma ghfir li (O Allah, forgive me), or some other duaa, it will be answered, and if he does wudoo and then prays, his prayer will be accepted. (Reported by al-Bukhaari)
Imaam Ibn Battaal said: Allah has promised through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that whoever wakes up from his sleep pronouncing words of Tawheed, submitting to His sovereignty, recognizing His blessings by praising Him, exalting Him above that which does not befit Him by glorifying Him (saying Subhaan Allah), submitting to Him by magnifying Him (saying Allahu akbar) and admitting ones utter dependence upon His help, then if he makes duaa it will be answered, and if he prays his prayer will be accepted. Everyone who hears this hadeeth should apply it and make the most of it, and make his intention sincerely for his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.
Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) woke up, he would say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi ahyaanaa bada maa amaatanaa wa ilayhi al-nushoor (Praise be to Allah Who has brought us back to life after having caused us to die, and unto Him is the resurrection). (Reported by Muslim).
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) woke up he would wipe the sleep from his face with his hand, then look at the sky and recite the final ten aayaat of Soorat Aal Imran: Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth [Aal Imraan 3:190 interpretation of the meaning]. (Reported by Muslim)
Imaam al-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is mustahabb (recommended) to wipe away the traces of sleep from ones face, and to recite these aayaat when getting up from sleep.
9 Being keen to take a nap or siesta during the day, whether before zuhr or after. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Take a nap, for the shayaateen do not take naps. (Reported by al-Tabaraani. Al-Saheehah, 2647).
Ishaaq ibn Abd-Allah said: Taking a nap is one of the deeds of good people. It revitalizes the heart and helps one to pray qiyam al-layl.
Al-Hasan al-Basri passed by a group of people in the marketplace in the middle of the day, and heard the racket they were making. He said, Do these people take a nap? It was said to him, No. He said, I think their nights must be bad.
10 Avoiding eating or drinking too much. Eating and drinking too much are two of the main obstacles that prevent people from praying qiyam al-layl. Al-Miqdaam ibn Mad Yakrib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Man fills no vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to have a few mouthfuls to give him the strength he needs. If he has to fill his stomach, then let him leave one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for air. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5674).
Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who burped in his presence: Stop your burping, for the people who eat the most in this life will be the most hungry on the Day of Resurrection. (Reported by al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami, 1190).
Sufyaan al-Thawri said: You should eat little, so that you will be able to pray qiyam al-layl.
Maqal ibn Habeeb saw some people eating a lot, and said, I do not think that our companions want to pray qiyam al-layl.
Wahb ibn Munabbih said: There is no son of Adam dearer to his shaytaan than the one who eats and sleeps a lot.
11 Striving against oneself to pray qiyam al-layl. This is one of the best means of helping oneself to pray qiyam, because human nature is inclined towards wrongdoing, so the one who follows his own inclinations will be led to doom and destruction. Allah has commanded us to strive against our own selves, as He says (interpretation of the meanings):
And strive hard in Allahs Cause as you ought to strive [al-Hajj 22:78]
And as for those who strive hard in Our Cause, We will surely guide them to Our Paths. And verily, Allah is with the muhsinoon (good-doers). [al-Ankaboot 29:69]
Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allahs Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them [al-Sajdah 32:16]
Fadaalah ibn Ubayd (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The mujaahid (warrior) is the one who strives against his own self for the sake of Allah. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibbaan. Al-Saheehah, 549).
According to the hadeeth of Uqbah ibn Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When a man from my ummah gets up to pray at night, striving against his own self to get up and purify himself, there are knots on him. When he washes his hands in wudoo, one knot is undone. When he washes his face, another knot is undone. When he wipes his head another knot is undone. When he washes his feet, another knot is undone. Then Allah says to those who are veiled (in the Unseen): Look at this slave of Mine, he is striving against his own self and asking of Me. Whatever My slave asks of Me shall be his. (Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Hibaan. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 627).
Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: I struggled against my own self for forty years until it became right. Thaabit al-Banaani said: I struggled for twenty years to make myself pray qiyam al-layl, and I enjoyed it (qiyam al-layl) for twenty years. Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez said: The best of deeds are those which we force ourselves to do. Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak said: The souls of righteous people in the past used to push them to do good deeds, but our souls do not do what we want them to do except by force, so we have to force them. Qutaadah said: O son of Adam, if you do not want to do any good except when you have the energy for it, then your nature is more inclined towards boredom and laziness. The true believer is the one who pushes himself.
12 Avoiding sin. If the Muslim wants to be one of those who earn the honour of speaking to Allah in the depths of the night, let him beware of sin, for the one who is contaminated with the stain of sin will not be helped to pray qiyaam al-layl. A man said to Ibraaheem ibn Adham, I cannot pray qiyam al-layl, so tell me the cure for this. He said, Do not commit sin during the day, and He will help you to stand before Him at night, for your standing before Him at night is one of the greatest honours, and the sinner does not deserve that honour.
A man said to al-Hasan al-Basri: O Abu Saeed, I sleep in good health, and I love to pray qiyam al-layl, and I prepare water with which to purify myself, so why can I not get up? Al-Hasan said: Your sins are restricting you. He said, may Allah have mercy on him, The slave who commits a sin will be denied the opportunity to pray qiyam at night and to fast during the day.
Al-Fudayl ibn Ayaad said: If you cannot pray qiyam al-layl, or fast during the day, know that you are indeed deprived and restricted, chained by your sins.
13 Checking oneself and rebuking oneself for not praying qiyam al-layl. Checking oneself is one of the signs of the righteous and truthful. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow, and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. [al-Hashr 59:18].
Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim said: If the slave is responsible and accountable for everything, even his hearing, sight and innermost thoughts, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of you will be questioned by Allah [al-Isra 17:36], then he should check on himself before he is brought to account.
Qiyam al-layl is an act of worship that connects the heart to Allah, may He be exalted, and enables it to overcome the temptations of life and to strive against ones own self, at the time when voices are stilled, eyes are closed in sleep, and sleepers are tossing and turning in their beds. Therefore qiyam al-layl is one of the measures of sincere determination and one of the qualities of those who have great ambitions. Allah has praised them and distinguished them from others in the Quraan, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): Is one who is obedient to Allah, prostrating himself or standing (in prayer) during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not? It is only men of understanding who will remember. [al-Zumar 39:9]
Qiyam al-layl is sunnah muakkadah (confirmed Sunnah), which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do when he said, You should pray qiyam al-layl, for it is the habit of the righteous people who came before you, and it will bring you closer to your Lord, expiate for bad deeds, prevent sin, and expel disease from the body. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ahmad).
According to a hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The best of prayers after the prescribed prayers is qiyam al-layl. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) always had the habit of praying qiyam al-layl, and never gave it up, whether he was travelling or staying at home. Even though he, among all the sons of Adam, would be the one to have all his past and future sins forgiven, he prayed qiyaam al-layl until his feet became swollen, and when he was asked about that, he said, Should I not be a grateful slave? (Agreed upon).
This is how the noble salaf were, may Allah have mercy upon them. Abul-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Pray two rakahs in the darkness of the night for the darkness of the grave. Ahmad ibn Harb said: I am astonished at people who know that the delights of Paradise lie above them and the horrors of Hell lie beneath them. How can they sleep in between them?
When Umar ibn Dharr saw that night had come, he would say: Night has come, and night has dignity, and Allah is most deserving of reverence.
For this reason, al-Fudayl ibn Ayaad said: I met some people who feel ashamed before Allah to sleep for too long in the depths of the night. Such a person may be resting on his side, and when he moves, he says to himself, This is not your right. Get up and take your share of the Hereafter.
Al-Hasan said: We do not know of any deed more difficult than the struggle to stay up at night or to spend money. It was said to him, Why do the mutahajjadeen (those who pray Tahajjud at night) have the most beautiful faces? He said, Because they spend time alone with the Most Merciful, so He adorns them with some of His light.
The women of the salaf also used to strive to pray qiyam al-layl with energy and determination. Where are the women of our own age when it comes to such great deeds? Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: I came to Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) one day to greet her, and I found her praying and reciting the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), But Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire [al-Toor 52:27], repeating it and weeping. I waited for her, but I got bored of waiting, so I went to the market for some things I needed, then I came back to Aaishah, and she was still praying and reciting this aayah and weeping.
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Jibreel said to me, Go back to Hafsah, for she fasts a lot and prays a lot at night (qiyam al-layl). (Reported by al-Haakim, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4227).
Muaadhah al-Adawiyyah, one of the righteous Taabiaat (successors of the companions of the Prophet) spent her wedding night, along with her husband Silah ibn Ashyam, praying until Fajr. When her husband and son were killed in the land of jihaad (battle), she would spend the whole night in prayer, worshipping and beseeching Allah, and she would sleep during the day. If she felt sleepy whilst she was praying at night, she would tell herself: O soul, there is plenty of sleep ahead of you.
When Habeebah al-Adawiyyah prayed Ishaa, she would stand on the roof of her house, wearing her chemise and khimaar (i.e., covered in proper Islamic dress), then she would say, O my God, the stars have come out, people have gone to sleep, and kings have closed their doors, but Your door is open. Every lover is alone with his lover, but here I am standing before You. Then she would start to pray and talk to her Lord until the time of suhoor. When the time of suhoor came, she would say, O Allah, this night is ending, the day is coming, and I wish I knew whether you have accepted this night (of worship) from me, so that I could congratulate myself, or if it has been rejected, so that I might console myself.
Amrah, the wife of Habeeb al-Ajami, prayed qiyam al-layl one night whilst her husband was asleep. When the time for suhoor came, and her husband was still asleep, she woke him up and said to him, Get up, my master, for the night has gone, the day has come and ahead of you lies a long road with little provision, and a small group of righteous people who have gone before us, and we are still here.
We ask Allah to help us to remember Him, to thank Him and to worship Him properly. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

    Takbeer in the mosque when hearing good news","Question

                Is it a bid'ah to yell ""takbeer""
    or ""tasbeeh"" everytime you have som good news in a masjid so that the
    congregation can chant in a group?",,"Praise be to Allah.When the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) heard something that pleased him, he would say: Allaahu akbar, Allaahumma la
    aysha ila aysh al-aakhirah (Allaah is most great, O Allaah, there is no
    real life except the life of the Hereafter). (Narrated by Ahmad). So it is permissible for a man to say Allaahu akbar when he sees
    something that makes him glad, and he can raise his voice, without going to extremes. But
    congergational Takbeer, where everyone starts and ends at the same time, is not prescribed
    in Islam, because there is no report to indicate that. But if one person says Takbeer,
    then another and another joins in, and they happen to say it at the same time, without
    prior agreement, then there is nothing wrong with this. They can also prostrate (sajdat

    home because of fiqhi differences between husband and wife","Question

                My husband is a strict follower of the
      Shafi'ee madhab, while I prefer to choose the fatwa which my mind tells me is based on
      stronger daleel no matter what the origin of the school is, whenever there is a difference
      between the well-known madhabs. My husband tells me that I don't have the right to do this
      since I am not a scholar myself. Is he right?Please reply if at all possible, because there has been a lot of tension
      in my household because of this.",,"Praise be to Allah.In order to answer this question, we must shed light on
    three things:
we must point out the importance of avoiding sectarianism in following
        any school of thought, whether it has to do with fiqh, thought or anything else. We should
        get into the habit of following the Quraan and Sunnah and letting them be our guide.

There is such a thing as the inclination to follow one of the opinions
        of the fuqaha, not on the basis of Tarjeeh (weighing and comparing evidence) but
        because of a desire to follow the easiest way or because it suits one's own desires. A
        person may find some justification for motives that he thinks are correct, and does not
        realize they are wrong until later on. Therefore one should only select or give preference
        to an opinion either by studying the matter and examining the evidence and proofs offered
        by all sides, which should be done by one who has sound knowledge, or else by following a
        scholar who is well known to be knowledgeable, religious, pious and righteous, so that one
        feels confident of his sincerity and wide knowledge.

Keeping the peace in the marital home is more important than disputing
        as to whose opinion or madhhab should prevail, so long as the issue in question is one in
        which differences of opinion are permissible and every opinion has some grounds for
        validity. At the same time, it should be pointed out to the husband, gently and calmly,
        that it is important to base ones opinions on sound evidence, and that not every
        scholarly opinion or madhhab is always correct. The scholars themselves said that their
        opinions should be discounted if they contradicted well known evidence, as
        al-Shaafai said: If my opinion contradicts a hadeeth of the Messenger of
        Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), cast it aside (lit. throw it against
        the wall).

If you and your husband are not students of shareeah with a firm
    grounding of knowledge, then you have to refer to one of the scholars and follow his
    opinions. If you agree on a scholar you can both refer to him, and if your husband chooses
    someone according to what he thinks is best and you choose someone else, there is nothing
    wrong with that. Each of you can follow his or her scholar in matters that do not affect
    the other, but in matters where the husband has authority or responsibility, the opinion
    of the scholar whom your husband is following should prevail. And Allaah knows best."

                My question is very embarrassing but
      there is nobody I can ask about this.
     My husband is good and pious, and
      I have no reason not to trust him, but he is not giving me my rights in bed. Is it
      permissible for me to ask him for a divorce, or will I be one of those who will not smell
      the fragrance of Paradise?",,"Praise be to Allah.If a husband is fulfilling his Islamic duties towards his wife, it is
    not permissible for her to ask him for a divorce, because the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any woman asks her husband for a divorce
    for no compelling reason, she will be deprived of the fragrance of Paradise.” (Reported
    by Imaam Ahmad, 21874, and Ibn Maajah, 2055). The meaning of the phrase
    “for no compelling reason” is anything that gives her a strong motive for
    seeking divorce. (Sharh Ibn Maajah ‘ala al-Sanadi).
    As for intercourse in bed, if the wife’s demands
    are greater than what is normal, it is not permissible for her to seek a divorce (the word
    “normal” refers to what is usual, such as once a week or once every ten days and
    so on, and people vary in their capacity in this regard). For more information, please see
    Question # 1078.

                I have a VERY important and urgent question. I would really like a DETAILED answer as your answer could change my life !!!
Mail me if you want more information.
Please be patient with the length of my question as I believe the more I inform you the better you can answer the question.
I live in the West and I was born in a Muslim family. From my early teenage years I became active in Islam. Even from a young age I believed in Islam and I even wondered how people went to sleep without praying !!
I'm now much older and I have changed completely. My belief in Islam and even in Allah has disappeared. Basically I have become an outright hypocrite of the worst kind. I stay away from women but not pornography. I am prepared and trying to give that up and that maybe the cause of my fall but I've noticed that it's too late, as this is now a branch of the problem and not the root as the root of the problem is my belief in Allah and Islam.
Sometimes I believe I am crazy as I continuosly have erroneous thoughts about God, where I came from, Islam, right and wrong, etc.. I seem to be fighting between belief and disbelief, especially during prayer.
I have not abandoned prayer, etc, but it really does not benefit me any more. If you meet me you'll think I'm practicing from my appearance and speech, etc, I go to the mosque, I fast, but really I'm a true hypocrite whom no one knows. I cannot go on like this. 
I actually actively give Dawah aswell to non-muslims but in my heart I really disbelieve, so why am I doing this ??? But when I directly discuss Allah it hurts me due to my confusion as I have lost my belief and find it hard to fake belief at times !!!",,"Praise be to Allah.You should know, my brother, that the most essential thing for any
        person is his commitment to Islam and his faith, and he will not be harmed by whatever he
        misses out on of worldly things if Allaah keeps his religion safe. Allaah is the King of
        kings and is the One Who moves the heart; He Alone is the One Who strengthens the heart
        and makes it steadfast. For this reason I advise you, my brother, to turn to Allaah, for
        He is a loving and merciful Lord Who is Compassionate towards His slaves. If you turn to
        Him sincerely and pray with true longing and ask Him to strengthen your faith and protect
        you from the evil of the whispers of your own soul and of the Shaytaan, then Allaah is
        Close and responds to the prayers of those who call on Him. Do not forget this important
        fact, for it is a source of relief and a way out from your problem, in sha Allaah. I would
        also like to remind you of the virtues of reading Quraan and reciting a lot of
        duaas, morning and evening, for this will have a great effect in bringing
        peace and comfort to your heart.
Avoid the things that will make you feel far away from Allaah and bring
        you closer to the Shaytaan and his whispers. One of these things is what you mention in
        your question, namely looking at pornography and so on, because if a person persists in
        sin, it piles up in his heart until it is overwhelmed with darkness and is not affected by
        any exhortation or preaching. So hasten to repent from this sin and others, and fulfil the
        conditions of repentance properly. We also advise you to avoid sitting with bad company
        and in gatherings that could increase your confusion or provoke your desires; look for
        good people and keep company with them, because a man will be on the religion of his
        friend.
It seems from your question that you are suffering from a specific
        psychological problem, either financial or social or otherwise, and this is having an
        effect on this waswaas (insinuating thoughts from Shaytaan) that you are suffering. If
        this is indeed the case, we advise you to treat this problem quickly, because this may be
        a way of dealing with what you are suffering from. We will help you as much as we can, in
        sha Allaah.
What you are going through might be a kind of depression or anxiety, for
        one reason or another. You know that Allaah has not created a disease without also
        creating the cure. It is known that there are medicines that may be of help, by the grace
        of Allaah, in treating this kind of sickness. So ask about this kind of medication from a
        psychiatrist."

    invalidates a man’s prayer if she passes in front of him, which we will discuss

    it is clear that it is not correct for a woman to lead a man or men in prayers.” (al-Muhallaa,

    ‘Ali ibn Sulaymaan al-Mardaawi al-Hanbali (may

                If I forgot to say Adhkar as-sabah (words of remembrance for the morning) before sunrise, is it acceptable if I say them whenever I wake up?",,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Adhkar al-sabah (supplications recited in the morning) are not connected 
    only to the time when the sun rises; in Arabic the word subh (morning) 
    applies to dawn and the first part of the day, as is stated in al-Qamoos 
    al-Muheet, 291 
    
    [a famous Arabic language dictionary – Translator]. 
    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    
    “… and celebrate the praises of your Lord in the evening and in the 
    morning.”

    
    [Ghafir 40:55 – Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation]

    
    Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer  (exegesis) (4/86) that this means in 
    the early part of the day and in the early part of the night. But the best 
    time of the day for making dhikr (reciting words of remembrance) is after 
    the dawn prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    
    “… and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and 
    before its setting…”

    
    [Taha 20:130]

    
    And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    prays Fajr in congregation, then sits and remembers Allah (makes dhikr) 
    until the sun rises, then prays two rak’ahs (units of prayer), will have a 
    reward like that for Hajj and ‘Umrah (major and minor Pilgrimage), complete, 
    complete, complete.” (Saheeh al-Jami’, 6222).

    
    Based on the above, this is how we understand the reports narrated on this 
    topic, such as the hadeeths (narrations): 

    
    “Whoever says, in the morning and the evening, ‘Subhan Allahi wa bi 
    hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)’ one hundred times, will not come 
    with anything better than it on the Day of Resurrection, except for one who 
    does likewise or does more.” 
    
    (Reported by Muslim, 2692).

    
    “Allahumma bika asbahna wa bika amsayna wa bika nahya wa bika namoot wa 
    ilayka al-nushoor (O Allah, by Your blessings we reach the morning, by 
    Your blessings we reach the evening, by Your blessings we live, by Your 
    blessings we die, and unto You is the Resurrection).” 
    
    (Reported by Abu Dawood in al-Sunan, no. (5068); al-Nasai 
    in al-Sunan al-Kubra (9836). Al-Albani said it is a saheeh hadeeth/authentic

    because it is still the time of subh (morning). And Allah is the Source of 
    strength.

    Muslim reported in his Saheeh (no. 747) that the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps without doing his 
    regular dhikr or part of it, then recites it during the time between the 
    Fajr prayer and Zuhr prayer, it will be recorded as if he had recited it at 
    night.”

    
    In Sharh Muslim (6/27), al-Nawawi said: 

    
    “This indicates that it is mustahabb (liked, preferred), to recite awrad (dhikr, 
    supplications) regularly, and that if one misses it, one can make it up 
    later.”

    
    In ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (4/198) it says: “This hadeeth indicates that it 
    is permissible to recite wird regularly at night, and that it is 
    permissible to make it up if one misses it because of sleeping or any other 
    reason. It also indicates that the one who does this between the Fajr prayer 
    and Zuhr prayer is like the one who does it at night, so it is mustahabb to 
    make up tahajjud if one misses it at night.”

                What is the structure of the Islam social class?
How does it work?  And to what extent does it exist?",,"Praise be to Allah.Human societies have known all kinds of class systems.
    In some societies there is a class of princes, a class of warriors, a class of farmers and
    a class of slaves, and based on this there is a lot of oppression, abuse and trampling on
    people’s rights. But the sharee’ah or law of Allaah does not recognize such
    systems at all. Islam gives equal rights to all, rich and poor, noble and ignoble. The
    basic principle on which people are differentiated in Islam is mentioned in the Holy
    Qur’aan, in Soorat al-Hujuraat (interpretation of the meaning):
“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and
    made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most
    honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-taqwa [i.e., is one of the
    muttaqoon or pious]. Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware”
[al-Hujuraat 49:13]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O
    people! Verily your Lord is One and your father [Adam] is one. An Arab is no better than a
    non-Arab, and a non-Arab is no better than an Arab; a red man is no better than a black
    man and a black man is no better than a red man – except if it is in terms of taqwa
    (piety)…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 22391; al-Silsilat al-Saheeh,
    2700).
    This is the principle on which society is based in
    Islam. This is the global human society which mankind is trying to attain through its
    far-fetched ideas, but is failing to do so, because they are not following the one
    straight path that will lead them there, the way to God, may He be glorified, and because
    they are not standing under the one banner that could unite them, the banner of God, may
    He be exalted.
People live on this earth connected by all kinds of relationships, all
    of which carry some weight or have some attraction in their lives… these include
    lineage, power, wealth, etc. From these stem other connections, practical, economic, etc.,
    where people have different positions and levels of status with regard to one another. So
    some people have more status than others in worldly terms… Then Islam comes and says:
    “the most honourable of you with Allaah [God] is that (believer) who has al-taqwa
    [i.e., is one of the muttaqoon or pious]” so it ignores all the values that carry
    weight in people’s lives, and replaces them all with this new value that is derived
    directly from the Revelation and is the only one that is recognized in the standards of
    God. This is piety and consciousness of God, which is manifested in the worship of God
    lone, with no partner, no son, no equal… obeying what He commands and avoiding what
    He forbids, seeking His pleasure and Paradise, and fearing His punishment and Hell-fire.

      I wanted to know if it is valid that I still keep my first marriage hidden from my parents
      and just get remarried to my wife. Please Comment.
      May Allah guides us All to the right path.",,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-Uthaymeen:
One of the Sunnahs with regard to marriage is that it should be
    announced publicly, with beating on the daff or hand-drum (i.e., celebrations), so
    as to distinguish it from fornication, which usually happens in secret. If the marriage
    contract has been drawn up in accordance with all the requisite conditions, then it is
    valid even if the family does not accept it. The issue of kafaaah or
    compatibility has to do with religious commitment, as Allaah has explained in His Book. A
    Muslim man can marry a Muslim woman, or a woman of the People of the Book (Jews and
    Christians) on the condition that she is chaste, but he is not permitted to marry a
    mushrikah (polytheist woman) or a zaaniyah (woman who commits adultery or fornication). He
    should, however, try to find a woman who is strongly committed to Islam. A Muslim woman is
    not permitted to marry anyone except a Muslim man. A man of the People of the Book does
    not qualify in terms of compatibility with her, and she should look for someone who is
    known among the Muslims to be committed to Islam and of good character.
With regard to the situation described in the question, we may note the
    following points:
The husband does not have to divorce his wife if his father asks him to
        do so.

The fathers rights are great indeed, and good treatment of one's
        family is a duty. If your father is suffering from heart disease, it is better if he does
        not know about this marriage. It is unlikely that his attitude has changed because it is
        based on the class/caste system and it is not easy for seniors to change their beliefs.

You have to make sure you understand your familys current attitude
        and to what extent they are prepared to accept your marriage to this woman. Perhaps they
        have heard that she has got married, and they think that she has married someone else, so
        they want to make you feel better (by saying they would accept her because she now seems
        to be safely out of the picture). Or perhaps they have heard that she has got married to
        you and they want to hear about it from you. Once you are sure that they have changed
        their attitude for real, there is nothing to stop you asking for permission from them and
        from your father to get married. If they give you permission, then this is what you want;
        if they do not, then just stay as you are now, so that no bad consequences will come to
        them as a result of them knowing about your marriage.

As far as repeating your marriage contract is concerned, we put this
    question to the Mufti Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, who
    replied with the conclusion that if the first contract met all the requisite conditions,
    and there are no impediments, then it is a valid contract. It should not be repeated lest
    that open the way to playing about with it. You should strive to please your family in
    every way you can and tell them that the matter has been concluded in an appropriate
    fashion. If there is genuine cause to fear for your fathers life, then it could be
    said that repeating the contract could be done on the grounds of necessity. And Allaah
    knows best."

It is permissible for a woman to see all of her husband’s body and for a man to see all of his wife’s body, with no need to go into details, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who guard their chastity (i.e., private parts, from illegal sexual acts), except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; but whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.” [al-Muminun 23:5-7] (Fatawa al-Mar’ah by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 121)
Can husband and wife bathe together?
Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih (no. 250) that ‘Aishah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to bathe from one vessel.”
Al-Hafiz said in al-Fath: “Al-Dawudi interpreted this to mean that it is permissible for a man to look at his wife’s ‘awrah and vice-versa. This is supported by the report narrated by Ibn Hibban via Sulayman ibn Musa, who was asked about a man looking at his wife’s private parts. He said: ‘I asked ‘Aishah, and she referred to this hadith.’ This is evidence in this matter. And Allah knows best.”
I say: as for the words that some people attribute to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that it is makruh (disliked) for a man to look at his wife’s private parts, this is not sahih. This includes the reports narrated from Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurayrah according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When any one of you has intercourse with his wife , let him not look at her private parts, because this causes blindness, and let him not speak, because this causes muteness.” Ibn al-Jawzi said: “(This is) mawdu’ (fabricated).” (See al-Mawdu’at by Ibn al-Jawzi, 2/271-272).

Salaam,",,"Praise be to Allah.It is true what you have said, that wrong is wrong. In Islam, pre-marriage relationships are not permissible. We believe that adultery is not permissible not only in Islam, but also in all religions of Allah (God). I believe that the gentleman of nationality Xyz whom you are seeing is not serious in getting married, because if he were, he would have married you from the very beginning. In Islam, a man must respect the will of his parents, and in some cases he must obey them. You, in your present status, are not a member of his family. When you become his wife, then you are considered to be his family. Yet even then, if a father orders his son to divorce his wife because, for example, she has bad reputation or she is not a good Muslim, he must obey his father. My advice to you is to think seriously in embracing Islam, not for the sake of this man, but for the salvation of your soul and body from Hellfire. I believe by now, you have a good idea what Islam is, putting aside the bad example this gentleman has been setting. Therefor, you should stop seeing this man and you should become Muslim. If his love to you is genuine, he will propose to you. If he doesnt, then be sure that Allah will not leave you alone, and as He guided you to his religion, He will send you a good Muslim who will cherish you and give you a decent life as a wife not as a mistress.

      parents have threatened to cut off all ties from him, and cut off his inheritance.MY question is is my brother right to marry this girl with who he is
      intimately involved against my parents wishes?And is it right for my parents to disagree
      to the marriage on the terms i have stated and cut him off his inheritance?",,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the question of marriage, if you have any
    authority or influence over your brother and can convince him to give up the idea of
    marrying this woman, then remember that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) commanded the Muslim to marry the woman who is religious. This woman
    is sinful and goes against the religion, she is not modest in her dress and she drinks
    wine, so he should not marry this woman.
With regard to the issue of his disobedience towards his parents, this
    sin is more serious than the one mentioned above. They have told him to obey Allah and to
    keep away from sin, so he must obey them and avoid going against their wishes. Your
    familys rejection of this marriage is quite correct according to shareeah,
    because they are enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and seeking to
    control one who is insane.
It is permissible, indeed it is necessary, to forsake him if doing so
    will stop him from going ahead, because marriage to this woman will keep him away from his
    religion. In America and in other kaafir countries there are many individuals in the
    Indian, Pakistani and Arab communities who have forsaken their religion and are no longer
    Muslim in anything but name.
As regards depriving him of his inheritance, this should not be done
    unless he becomes an apostate (leaves Islam). So long as he is within the pale of Islam,
    and does not do anything to put him outside of Islam or to make him a kaafir, then it is
    not permissible to deprive him of his inheritance, because this is something prescribed by
    Allaah, and as such it is not permissible to change it. And Allaah knows best,"

    no idea to which part of salah that takbir was reffered so i ended up confusing the oreder
    of salah.",,"Praise be to Allah.When a woman prays behind an imaam, it is not essential
    for her to see him or some of the people who are praying behind him, but the rows have to
    be straight and the women who are praying should be within the boundaries of the mosque
    and be able to hear the voice of the imaam, so that they can follow him. If women are
    unable to hear the imaams voice for some reason, then they should pray individually,
    or in a jamaaah with other women, if they cannot hear the imaams voice or
    follow him. If a woman enters the mosque and hears the imaam saying takbeer, she should
    not follow him in saying takbeer until she knows whether he is in sujood or rukoo
    etc. The way out of this dilemma  if she cannot see the imaam or any members of the
    congregation  is to wait until the imaam says sami Allaahu liman
    hamidah, then she can pray with him. Ibn Abd al-Barr said in al-Kaafi
    (1/212): Everyone who can see or hear the imaam, and knows where he is in the
    prayer, and is behind him, it is permissible for him to follow him in prayer. This is the
    Maaliki view. And Ibn Qudaamah said: If there is a barrier between the imaam
    and the person who is following him, which prevents him from seeing the imaam or the
    people praying behind him, then there are two views narrated from Ahmad, one of which says
    that it is not valid for him to pray behind him and the second view is: it is valid
    because he can follow the imaam without seeing him, as a blind person does. But for his
    following the imaam to be valid, he has to be able to hear him. (al-Mughni,
    2/208)
In conclusion, if you are inside the mosque and you can hear the
    imaams voice and you know where he is in the prayer, then follow him, otherwise pray
    by yourself or with a group of women after the imaam finishes the prayer. 
    With regard
    to whether your prayer is valid or not, we asked Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih
    al-Uthaymeen, and he replied that to be on the safe side you should repeat the
    prayer. And Allaah is the source of strength."
1058,3839,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3839,"Are physical medicines better, or ruqyah and spiritual medicine?","Question

Modern medicine treats disease with physical medicine only. Is this sufficient, or should we use ruqyah? Which of them is better?",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that man suffers psychological diseases, such as anxiety about the future and grief for the past. Psychological diseases may have a greater impact on the body than physical diseases. Treating these diseases by means of something prescribed in sharee’ah – i.e., ruqyah – is more successful than treating them by means of physical medicines, as is well known.
Among the means of treating them: the saheeh haseeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him): “There is no believer who is stricken by anxiety, distress or grief, and he says, ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibnu ‘abdika ibnu amatika, naasiyati bi yadika, maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an taj’ala al-Quran al-‘azeem rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi wa ghammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or taught to any of Your creation, or revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Holy Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety and distress)’, but Allah will relieve him.” This is one of the medicines prescribed in sharee’ah.
Similarly, one may say, “Laa ilaaha illa anta, subhaanaka, inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers)” [cf. al-Anbiyaa’ 21:87]
If you want to know more, please refer to the writings of the scholars on the topic of adhkaar (dhikr, remembering Allah), such as al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi, and Zaad al-Ma’aad, by Ibn al-Qayyim.
But when faith grows weak, the soul’s acceptance of remedies prescribed in sharee’ah also grows weak. People nowadays have begun to rely on physical medicines more than on the spiritual remedies prescribed in Islam. But when faith is strong, the spiritual remedies prescribed in Islam have a more complete effect; their effect may be faster than that of physical medicines. We are all aware of the story of the man whom the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent on a campaign. He camped near some Arabs, but those people near whom he camped did not show him any hospitality. Allah willed that their chief should be stung by a snake, and they said to one another, “Go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find a raaqi (one who recites ruqyah, i.e., incantations or prayers for healing) with them.” The Sahaabah said to them, “We will not recite ruqyah for your chief until you give us such and such number of sheep.” They said, “We agree.” Then one of the Sahaabah went and recited over the one who had been stung; he recited Soorat al-Faatihah only, then that person who had been stung got up as if he was released from a chain. 
This recitation of al-Faatihah had such an effect in this man because it came from a heart that was filled with faith. When they came back, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?”
But in our own times there is this weakness of religious commitment and faith, and people have started to rely on outward physical matters, and this is causing them further suffering.
On the other hand there are those who cheat people and deceive them,  claiming to be pious reciters of Quran, but they consume people’s wealth unlawfully. People are of two extremes, one which thinks that recitation of Quran has no effect at all, and the other extreme composed of cheaters who deceive people by reciting devious recitations, and some are moderate.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/465, 466
But as there is no contradiction between using permissible physical medicines as prescribed by doctors and using spiritual medicines such as ruqyah and seeking refuge with Allah and other du’aa’s that are proven in sound reports, the two may be combined, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. It was proven that he used both kinds of treatment, and he said, “Strive to pursue that which will benefit you and seek refuge with Allah, and do not feel helpless.” And he said: “Seek treatment, O slaves of Allah, but do not seek treatment with things which are haram.”"

I consulted the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), saying, ‘O Messenger of Allah, my mother has come to me and she is asking for help. Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?’ He said, ‘Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with her.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 2946)
 It was narrated that a Jewish woman came begging to `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and she gave her something. The Jewish woman said to `Aishah, “May Allah protect you from the punishment of the grave.” `Aishah did not like that, and when she saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) she asked him about it and he said “No.” `Aishah said: “Then later on, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It has been revealed to me that you will be tried in your graves.’” (Musnad Ahmad, no. 24815)
These two hadiths indicate that it is permissible to give charity to the non-Muslims. But it is not permissible to give zakah funds to the poor among the kuffar, because zakah can only be given to Muslims to spend on the poor and needy among them as mentioned in the ayah of zakah.
Imam al-Shafi`i said: “There is nothing wrong with giving charity to a mushrik as a nafilah (supererogatory) action, but he has no right to charity from the obligatory (zakah). Allah praised people who, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the Miskin (the poor), the orphan, and the captive’ [al-Insan 76:8].” (Kitab al-Umm, part 2)
Giving charity to poor Muslims is preferable and more befitting, because spending on them helps them to obey Allah, and it helps them in both their worldly and spiritual affairs. This helps to strengthen the bonds among Muslims, especially nowadays when the poor among the Muslims far outnumber the rich. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.
What does Islam say about begging for money?
If the person who is asking for the money is Muslim and is definitely in need, then give him what you can in charity. The same applies even if he is not Muslim. But it is better for Muslims who are in need to refrain from begging in the streets. If they have no other choice, they should go to Islamic charity organizations which exist to channel charitable donations to the poor and needy. By the same token, those who want to give charity can also contact reliable charitable organizations so that their charity will reach those who deserve it.
Can we give charity to someone to do something haram?  
If the person who is asking for money –regardless of whether he is a Muslim or a non-Muslim – is asking for it in order to commit sin and buy something that is haram, or he is going to use the money to help him to do something haram, then it is not permissible to give that charity to him, because by doing so, one is helping him to commit that haram action. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.” [Al-Maidah 5:2]

    hadeeth “Souls are like conscripted soldiers”","Question

                A'ushu mina Eshaytan errajimBismi Allahi Errahman ErrahiimAssalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakatuh Dear ImamI am a revert and my homepage is at : ..I have found the Haadith below and i have asked an Uztazah about it. I
      send you her answer.I am very troubled about the Haadith and the answer I received concerning
      what this Haadith really means.Please, could you tell me more about this matter and if there are other
      Haadiths confirming it?JazakallahkhairanMay Allah Taalah reward you for your efforts in His Deen
       Narrated by Abu Hurayrah the hadith doesn't say ""humans were alive
      before being born"". Only the souls were in heaven. This heaven is not the one people with good deeds go to in the hereafter.
      It is somewhere that we do not know. It's in the Lohmahfuz....only Allah knows. In simple
      words this place is like a ""bank"" where the souls created by Allah were placed.
      So when a woman is pregnant, at the point where Allah gives the soul to the creation in
      the womb, He will take one of these souls. So, there were good and bad souls. Let say, the
      bad soul is given to the creation, the baby is born and become a bad person. However, this
      grown up person can have a change in his/her destiny due to his/her deeds in his life.
      This is where the du'a plays a major role. The du'a and the inten",,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him)
    reported in his Saheeh that Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her)
    said: I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying:
    Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those whom they recognize, they get along with,
    and those whom they do not recognize, they will not get along with. (Saheeh
    al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Ahaadeeth al-Anbiyaa, Baab al-Arwaah junood mujannadah).
    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his
    commentary on the hadeeth: Concerning the phrase Souls are like conscripted
    soldiers al-Khattaabi said: This may refer to their similarity as
    regards good or evil, righteousness or corruption. Good people are inclined towards other
    good people, and evil people are similarly inclined towards other evil people. Souls feel
    affinity with others according to the nature in which they were created, good or evil. If
    souls natures are similar, they will get along, otherwise they will not be on good
    terms with one another. It could be that what is being referred to is the beginning of
    creation in the realm of the unseen when, it is reported, souls were created before
    bodies, and used to meet one another and express their pessimism about the future. When
    souls have entered bodies (come to the physical realm) they may recognize one another from
    the past, and may be on friendly terms or otherwise based on that past experience.
Someone else said: What it means is that when souls are created,
    they are made in two parts, and when the bodies in which the souls reside meet in this
    world, they either get along together or do not, based on the way in which these souls are
    created in this world.
I say that this is not contradicted by the fact that some people who do
    not like one another at first may get along well later on, because the hadeeth is probably
    speaking about the moment of first meeting, which has to do with the original creation and
    nothing else. If they dislike one another at first but later come to like one another, it
    is because of something new, a new quality that makes them love one another after the
    initial dislike, such as a kaafir becoming a Muslim or a sinner being reformed. 
The phrase conscripted soldiers refers to different types
    or classifications, or groups brought together. Ibn al-Jawzi said: What we learn
    from this hadeeth is that when a person finds that he feels dislike towards someone who is
    known to be virtuous or righteous, he should try to find out the reason for that so that
    he can make the effort to rid himself of something undesirable. The opposite (if a person
    finds himself liking someone who is known to be evil) also applies. Al-Qurtubi said:
    Although they are all souls, they differ in different ways, so a person will feel an
    affinity with souls of one kind, and will get along with them because of the special
    quality that they have in common. So we notice that people of all types will get along
    with those with whom they share an affinity, and will keep away from those who are of
    other types. [Birds of a feather flock together  Translator]. We may
    also note that within any given group or type, people may get along with some and dislike
    others, and this is in accordance with issues or qualities that form the basis of love or
    hate.
We have narrated a mawsool report in Sunan Abi Yalaa, at
    the beginning of which is the story narrated from Amrah bint Abd al-Rahmaan,
    who said: There was a woman in Makkah who liked to joke, and she came and stayed
    with a woman in Madeenah who was like her. When Aaishah heard about this, she
    said, My beloved spoke the truth. I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying and mentioned a similar hadeeth.
The hadeeth was also narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4773.
    Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those whom they recognize,
    they get along with, and those whom they do not recognize, they will not get along
    with, the scholars said that the meaning is groups gathered together, or different
    types. As for them getting along, this happens because of something in common between them
    that Allaah has created. It was said that they are similar attributes that Allaah has
    created in them, or that they were created in a group and then dispersed in their bodies,
    so people who have similar characteristics will like one another, and those who do not
    have similar characteristics will not like one another. Al-Khattaabi and others said: this
    getting along with one another has to do with what Allaah decreed from the outset about
    the ultimate destiny of souls, whether they will be among the blessed [in Paradise] or the
    doomed [in Hell]. Souls are of two opposing kinds, and when they meet in this physical
    world, they will either love or hate one another depending on the way they were created.
    Good souls will be inclined towards other good souls, and evil souls will be inclined
    towards other evil souls. And Allaah knows best."

                I am issuing orders for purchase of various

      & what rates and whom to be purchase) My work only to type the order & issue to
      the concern company. If any one give me gift in kinds like diary, calander, T-shirts etc.
      Is it is allowed (jayaj) to accept such items of gift. please clarify in details what is
      gift & what is bribe (Hindi/urdu word riswate).",,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih
    al’-Uthaymeen
Some companies give away promotional gifts to other companies with whom
    they have connections, and some of these promotional gifts may be of high value, such as
    watches, and some may be of lesser value, such as ordinary pens, diaries, calendars or
    t-shirts with the company logo. What is the ruling on such things?
Let us suppose, for example, that a company is trying to market a specific
    product, such as lumber etc., so they go to other construction companies who buy lumber
    and give their employees items promoting the lumber company, so that this company will
    gain a reputation and be known to the employees of the construction company. These gifts
    may vary in value. Is it permissible for the employees of the construction company to
    accept these gifts?
He answered, may Allaah preserve him:
“I am afraid that this may involve toying with the market or that it
    may lead to treachery on the part of those who take these gifts. I think that it is not
    allowed.”
Question:
Could we say that if these gifts that the company gives out as advertising
    are given to the general public, such as calendars, for example, then they may take them,
    but if they are given exclusively to these employees or they are of high values, they
    should not take them?
The Shaykh said:
“This is our fatwa, but there is still the fear that this is done in
    order to toy with the market, for example, if there is a company working with you and they
    give you a gift like those they give to the general public, then this is OK, because it
    does not affect anyone. But if the gift is given in an attempt to win customers and make
    it harder for competitors, then this gift should not be accepted. And Allaah knows
    best.”"

                Is
      it permissible to stop one’s prayer if the warning siren goes off in the
      case of an accident?",,"Praise be to Allah.If
      the accident is major and serious, then it is OK to stop one’s prayer;
      if it is a minor incident that can be dealt with after completing the
      prayer, then it is not permissible. The scholars said: it is obligatory to
      stop one's prayer in order to save a negligent person from a fatal
      accident. For example, if you are praying and you see a snake approaching
      a man who is sitting down and has not noticed it. If it is heading for
      him, you have to stop your prayer and tell him so that he will not be
      bitten, possibly fatally. Or if you see a blind man walking in front of
      you whilst you are praying, and he is heading towards a well, and you are
      afraid that he may fall into it, then you have to stop your prayer and
      save him from that fatal accident, even if this means stopping your
      prayer. The same applies in cases of fire, etc. 
      
      
      But
      if the siren goes off for a minor matter which can be dealt with after
      completing the prayer and it will not be too late if you complete the
      prayer first, then it is not permissible to stop your prayer before you
      have completed it, because this accident can be dealt with after
      completing the prayer, without anyone coming to further harm. And Allaah

1063,3895,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3895,Ruling on doing dangerous sports,"Question

                What is the ruling on doing dangerous sports, such as walking across tightropes in high places, jumping down from high places and staying in a cage with snakes?",,"Praise be to Allah.Just as Islam has commanded the Muslim to 
          take care of his physical wellbeing, so too it forbids him to do any 
          kind of harm to his body. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no 
          harming or reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, Kitaab 
          al-Ahkaam, 2332; Ahmad, 2719; Maalik, 1234).
 The scholars have discussed the matter 
          of doing dangerous sports.
 The author of al-Durr 
          al-Mukhtaar said: “According to the Hanafi fiqh, ‘… all kinds 
          of dangerous sports are permitted to the one who is skilled and is most 
          likely to be safe from harm, such as archery/shooting, or hunting snakes. 
          Watching these sports is permitted in such cases.’” (See al-Durr 
          al-Mukhtaar, 6/404) 
 The first condition:
Complete skill and proficiency 
          in these kinds of sports. That cannot be achieved without a lot of repeated 
          practice and training, until that level of proficiency is achieved. 
          If this training results in neglecting obligatory duties or ignoring 
          Sunnah or recommended actions, then the view that it is haraam is applicable 
          in this case. But if no such neglect results from this practice and 
          training, then the view that it is permitted is applicable, and it is 
          also permitted to watch.
 The second condition:
That it is most likely that 
          the person will be safe. If there is the slightest possibility that 
          he will not be safe, or there is doubt that he will be safe, then the 
          sport is haraam, because it may lead to his death. We are forbidden 
          to reach towards such things, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning):
“…and 
          do not throw yourselves into destruction…” 
[al-Baqarah 2:195] 
          
 The third condition.
The sport should not be done for money. It is haraam 
          to take payment for such sports, because this is regarded as consuming 
          people’s wealth unlawfully, as there is no benefit in it.
See Bughiyat al-Mushtaaq 
          fi Hukm al-Lahw wa’l-La’b wa’l-Sibaaq, p. 156-157. 
 I say: these things should be limited 
          to special occasions and celebrations, provided that they comply with 
          the conditions mentioned above. The soundness of this opinion is based 
          on the reports about the Ethiopians playing in the mosque, so these 
          matters should be restricted to the days of Eid. By analogy they may 
          also be done on other special occasions and celebrations. Similarly, 
          such sports are regarded as permissible on the condition that there 
          is no mixing of men and women, and that the ‘awrahs of the players are 
          not visible, and that no games of magic are involved."

    Allaah? [Yoonus 10:59]It is only for Allaah to say what is halaal and

    note of what is harmful to the interests of shareeah and what is beneficial, relying
    on the basic general principles of shareeah, such as the aayah (interpretation of
    the meaning),  he allows them as lawful al-tayyibaat [(i.e., all good and
    lawful things as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.]

    haraam, and every good and beneficial thing is halaal. If it is not known that it is

This was the view of the majority of scholars, and al-Nawawi reported that there was scholarly consensus on this point. (Al-Kafi, 1/173; al-Muhadhdhab, 1/33; al-Mughni, 1/229)
Their evidence is the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) whose authenticity is agreed upon, in which she narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to sleep whilst he was in a state of impurity , he would wash his private parts and do wudu as for prayer.

They also use as evidence the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allah, may any of us sleep when he is in a state of impurity?” He said, “yes, if he does wudu.” (Agreed upon).
The wisdom behind doing wudu is that it reduces the impurity and is better for the body.
The Zahiriyyah and Ibn Habib among the Malikis thought that it was obligatory for the person who is in a state of impurity to do wudu, on the basis of the hadith of ‘Umar referred to above.

Al-Nawawi said, commenting on this hadith: 
“The phrase ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came’ refers to the poor Bedouin who came to Madinah, and this was so that they could be helped. ‘Rendered’ means that they melted down the fat from the animals (to be stored and used).
The phrase ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came, but now eat some and preserve some and give some in charity’ is a clear statement that this prohibition of keeping more than three days’ worth of meat no longer applies; it is also a commandment to eat some and to give some in charity. With regard to the portion to be given in charity, if it is a voluntary sacrifice, then giving some of it in charity is obligatory, according to the view regarded by our companions as correct. It is preferable [mustahabb] for most of it to be given in charity. They said: at the very least, a third should be eaten, a third should be given as gifts and a third should be given in charity. There is another opinion that suggests half may be eaten and half given to charity. This difference of opinion has to do with the amount that is mustahabb. With regard to the other parts of the animal, it is OK to give them in charity. As for eating from it, it is mustahabb but is not wajib (obligatory)… The majority of scholars interpreted this command (i.e., the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… eat thereof…’ [al-Hajj 22:28 and 36]) as implying encouragement or permission, especially since it came after it had been prohibited.”
Malik said: 
“There is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich, whether one wants to give it uncooked or cooked.” (Al-Kafi, 1/424) 
The Shafi`is said that it is mustahabb to give most of it in charity, and said: “At least one third of it may be eaten , and one third given in charity, and one third given away as gifts.” They said that one half may be eaten, but it is more correct to give some of it away in charity .” (Nayl al-Awtar, 5/145; al-Siraj al-Wahhaj, 563). 
Ahmad said: 
“We go along with the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah (ibn ‘Abbas – may Allah be pleased with them both): ‘He should eat one third himself, feed one third to whomever he wants, and give one third in charity.” (Reported by Abu Musa al-Isfahani in al-Wazaif; he said it is a hasan hadith. This is also the opinion of Ibn Mas’ud and Ibn ‘Umar. No conflicting opinion is known among the Companions.” (Al-Mughni, 8/632)
The reason why there is a difference of opinion as to how much of the sacrifice may be given in charity is that there are conflicting reports, and some reports were narrated without specifying a particular amount, such as the report of Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I had forbidden you to eat from the sacrificial meat for more than three days so that those who could afford it could give to those who are poor, but now you can eat as you wish, feed others from it, and preserve some.’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1430; he said it is a sahih hasan hadith). The scholars among the Companions of the Prophet and others followed this.

I have a bank loan, and very strongly I wish to go for ‘umrah. But as I know I have to finish all the loans before I can go to ‘Umrah or Hajj. Can you please tell me the proper way and limitations in Islam?","It is permissible for a person who is in debt and facing financial hardship, either because he is unable to earn money or because the creditor is absent and he cannot pay him, to go for Hajj if certain conditions are met.","Praise be to Allah.Interest-based loans
If this loan is based on riba (usury, interest) , then it is haram and is one of the major sins and one of the seven sins that doom a person to Hell. All of the nations regarded it as forbidden, even the Greeks who were idol-worshippers. One of them, whose name was Solon said: Money is like a sterile hen; a drachma cannot give birth to a drachma. 
In the Christian belief it says that one who consumes usury should not be shrouded if he dies, and even the Jews forbade usury. 
Islam has forbidden it in a manner that leaves no room for doubt concerning its prohibition.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein.” [al-Baqarah 2:275] 
“O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.” [al-Baqarah 2:278]
Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the price of blood, the price of a dog and the earnings of a prostitute, and he cursed the woman who does tattoos and those who have them done, the one who consumes riba (usury) and the one who pays it, and he cursed the one who makes images. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2123)
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it. (Narrated by Muslim, 1597)
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what are they?” He said: “Associating others in worship with Allah (shirk); witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden killing, unless that is done lawfully; consuming riba (usury, interest); consuming the property of orphans; running away from the battlefield; slandering innocent, chaste, believing women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2615; Muslim, 89)
Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Last night I saw (in a dream) that two men came to me and took me out to a sacred land. They set out with me until we came to a river of blood in which a man was standing, and on the bank of the river there was a man with stones in front of him, facing the man who was in the river. Every time the man wanted to get out, the man (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth and he went back to where he had been. I said: ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘The one whom you saw in the river is the one who consumed riba.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1979)
So you have to repent to Allah from this action. 
But if the loan was a good kind of loan that did not involve riba, there is nothing wrong with it. 
Going for Hajj or paying off the debt? 
With regard to Hajj, the person who cannot spend on himself because he is of limited means is not obliged to go for Hajj, but which of the two is more important, going for Hajj or paying off the debt? 
The most correct view is that paying off the debt is more important, because the debtor is not obliged to do Hajj, since one of the conditions of Hajj is that one should be able to do it. 
If there is a conflict between your doing Hajj and your paying off your debt , then give priority to paying off the debt . But if there is no conflict, such as there being plenty of time for you to pay off your debt, or if the person to whom you owe money is patient and can wait, then the correct view is that there is nothing wrong with your doing Hajj or ‘Umrah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is permissible for a person who is in debt and facing financial hardship, either because he is unable to earn money or because the creditor is absent and he cannot pay him, to go for Hajj if someone else takes him for Hajj, provided that this does not affect his ability to pay the debt.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 26/16)
All of that is subject to the condition that you are completely able to perform Hajj and that you pay off debts to anyone who asks you to pay him back when the debt becomes due, and that you are able to pay for the journey and its provisions, and whatever you need to take care of your affairs whilst you are travelling, without neglecting your family or those on whom you are obliged to spend. 
So you should leave with them enough to cover their needs. If you do not do that then you are sinning and neglecting those whom Allah has commanded you to take care of. 
Khaythamah said: “We were sitting with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr when Qaharman came to him. He said, ‘Have you given the slaves their food?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and give it to them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he withholds the food of his slave.”’ (Sahih Muslim, 996)
Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he neglects those whom he is responsible for.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1692)

    both himself, as did his successors (the khulafa’). But if one man gives the khutbah
    and another leads the prayer for a valid reason, this is permissible. This is what Ahmad
    stated…because if it is permissible for someone else to take over leading the prayer
    for a valid reason, then this applies even more so in the case of the khutbah with the
    prayer. If there is no reason, then Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ‘I do
    not like it if there is no excuse.’ The reason why it is not liked may be because the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do both of them, and he
    said, ‘Pray as you have seen me praying’ (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Ahmad),
    and because the khutbah takes the place of two rak’ahs. The reason why it is
    permissible may be because the khutbah is separate from the prayer, as if it is two

The fact that the one who leads the prayer knows more
    Qur’aan than the khateeb is not a reason for going against the Sunnah of the khateeb

What is the wisdom behind the Islamic prohibition on gambling?",Gambling is haram because Allah has forbidden it. Gambling destroys families and causes the loss of wealth through haram means. Gambling results in enmity and hatred among the players. Gambling turns people away from the remembrance of Allah.,"Praise be to Allah.Is gambling haram?
Gambling is haram because Allah has forbidden it, and He rules as He wills. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), gambling, al-Ansab [sacrifices for idols, etc.] and al-Azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision] are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drink) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91]
Why is gambling haram?
With regard to the wisdom behind the prohibition of gambling , any wise person will see that there are many reasons for it, including the following:

Gambling makes a person rely on accidents, luck and wishful thinking for his earnings, instead of hard work, the sweat of his brow and paying respect to the ways prescribed by Allah.
Gambling destroys families and causes the loss of wealth through haram means. It makes rich families poor and humiliates proud souls.
Gambling results in enmity and hatred among the players, because they are consuming one another’s wealth unlawfully and getting wealth unlawfully.
Gambling turns people away from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, and pushes the players to have the worst of attitudes and habits.
Gambling is a sinful hobby that wastes time and effort, and makes people get used to laziness and idleness. It stops the ummah from working and producing.
Gambling pushes people to commit crimes because the one who is penniless wants to get hold of money in any way he can, even if he has to steal it or take it by force, or through accepting bribes and cheating.
Gambling causes stress, illness and nervous breakdowns. It breeds hatred and in most cases leads to crime, suicide, insanity and chronic illness.
Gambling pushes the gambler to bad behaviour such as drinking alcohol and taking drugs. The atmosphere in which gambling takes place is dimly lit and filled with cigarette smoke; people talk in hushed voices and whispers, and sneak in and out as if they are up to no good. They come in hesitantly, filled with suspicion, and gather around the green table, breathing uneasily and with their hearts pounding. They are supposed to be friends playing a game, but in reality they are enemies, each of them lying in wait for the other and trying to make gains at the expense of the other and his children. The owner of the place tries to numb the feelings of all participants by offering dreamy music, fallen women, all kinds of drinks and cigarettes. The green table is surrounded with cheating and deception. The waiters and girls may tell one player about another player’s cards, helping one player to beat another by means of nods and whispers. Sometimes they achieve a kind of balance to make sure the game carries on and people stay for longer. No doubt everyone loses in the end, they lose the money they spend on drinks and cigarettes, the money they give to the waiters, the money they spend on drinks for the girls, and all kinds of other losses. Even the one who wins all or most of the games loses all or most of his winnings, and the loser loses everything. And at the end of the night, they all sneak away, showing the signs of depression and humiliation, and the loser warns the winner to look out the next day. (Ahmad Shalabi, al-Hayat al-Ijtima’iyyah fi’l-Tafkir al-Islami, p. 241)

What are the negative consequences of gambling?
How many families have become poor because of gambling ? How many mouths have gone hungry, how many bodies have become naked or been clothed in nothing but rags? How many marriages have failed, how many jobs have been lost, because of a person who stole money to support his gambling habit? How many men have sold their religion and honour at the gambling table? Gambling destroys everything, even when the aim is money. It includes wine, smoking, bad company, darkness, confusion, cheating, hatred, watching for opportunities to take advantage of others, deception and all other kinds of evil. (Qadaya al-Lahw wa’l-Tarfih, p. 388)
We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.

With regard to this particular matter, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin replied as follows:
“Yes, if he fasts six days of Shawwal , he does not have to fast al-Ayyam al-Beed during that month too, whether he fasted the six days at the same time as al-Ayyam al-Beed (the 13 th, 14th and 15th of the hijri month) or before them or after them, because it is true that he has fasted three days of the month. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast three days of every month, and he did not bother whether he fasted them at the beginning of the month or in the middle or at the end.”
This case is similar to that of Tahiyyat al-Masjid (prayer to “greet the mosque” upon entering), which does not have to be done if one prays a regular prayer upon entering the mosque. So if you enter the mosque and pray a regular Sunnah prayer, you do not have to pray Tahiyyat al-masjid…

Does a woman have to defend herself if someone wants to rape her, and is she allowed to use a weapon for that purpose?",,"Praise be to Allah.A woman who is being forced to commit zinaa [unlawful sexual activity] is obliged to defend herself and should not give in even if she kills the one who wants to do that to her. This self-defence is waajib (obligatory), and she is not at fault if she kills the one who wants to force her into zinaa. Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever is killed defending his property is a shaheed (martyr), whoever is killed defending himself is a shaheed, whoever is killed defending his religion is a shaheed, and whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed. In the commentary on this hadeeth it says: whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed refers to the one who defends the honour of his wife and female relatives.
If a man is obliged to defend his wife and fight off the one who wants to rape her even if this leads to his own death then this obligation applies even more to the woman herself, who must defend herself and not give in to the aggressor who wants to violate her honour, even if she is killed, because if she is killed she will also be a shaheedah, just as her husband will be a shaheed if he was killed defending her honour. Shahaadah (martyrdom, the status of shaheed) is a high status which is only achieved by the one who dies in the way of obedience to Allaah and that which He loves, which indicates that Allaah loves this kind of defence, a mans fighting to defend his wifes honour and a womans fighting to defend herself. But if she is unable to defend herself, and the evil aggressor overpowers her and rapes her by force, then she should not be subjected to any punishment (hadd or tazeer); rather, the punishment should be carried out on the evil aggressor.
It says in al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbali: Concerning a woman who was pursued by a man, and she killed him to protect herself, Ahmad said: If she knew that he wanted [to rape] her, and she killed him to protect herself, then she is not at fault. Ahmad mentioned the hadeeth which al-Zuhri reported from al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, from Ubayd ibn Umayr, in which it said that a man had visitors from [the tribe of] Hudhayl, and he wanted [to rape] a woman, so she threw a rock at him and killed him. Umar said, By Allaah, there is no diyah for him ever i.e., she did not have to pay the blood money for him. If it is permissible to defend one's money, which one can give away, then a woman defending and protecting herself and her honour which cannot be given away, is clearly more permissible than a man defending his money. If this is clear, then she is obliged to defend herself if she can, because letting someone overpower her [rape her] is haraam, and by not defending herself, she lets him overpower her. [al-Mughni, 8/331]
And Allaah knows best. Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah, 5/42-43.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah, 18: (Section) A woman who had committed zinaa was brought to Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), and he asked her about it and she admitted it, so he commanded that she should be stoned. Ali said: Maybe she had a reason. So he said to her, What made you do that? She said, I had a partner who shared livestock with me; his camels had water and milk, and mine had none. I got thirsty, so I asked him to give me something to drink, but he refused unless I let him have his way with me. I refused three times, but I was so thirsty that I thought I was going to die, so I gave him what he wanted, and he gave me something to drink. Ali said: Allaahu akbar! But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Baqarah 2:173 interpretation of the meaning].
In Sunan al-Bayhaqi it says: From Abu Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami, who said: A woman was brought to Umar who had been extremely thirsty, and had passed by a shepherd and asked him to give her something to drink; he had refused to give her something to drink unless she let him have his way with her. [Umar] consulted with the people as to whether he should have her stoned. Ali said, She was forced to do it. I think you should let her go. So he did so. I say: this is what should be done. If a woman is in desperate need of food and drink from a man, which he will not give her unless she lets him have his way with her, and she is scared that she will die without them, so she lets him have his way with her, then she is not to be punished. If it were asked, is it permissible for her in this situation to let him have his way with her, or does she have to suffer [her hunger and thirst] with patience, even if she dies? The answer is that her case is like that of a woman who is forced to commit zinaa, to whom it is said, Either you let me have my way with you, or I will kill you. The woman who is forced to do this should not be punished; she can save herself from being killed in this manner, but if she bears it (i.e., being killed) with sabr (patience), this is better for her.

                In one of the mosques there is a partition between men and women. A dispute has arisen as to how important this partition is. Some think that there is no need for it, because at the time of the Messenger 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) there was no partition; others insist on having it. The resulting argument may lead those who think there should be no partition to stop praying in the mosque, despite the fact that removing the partition could lead to some degree of mixing or looking at the opposite sex when leaving the mosque, because some of the men are not strongly committed in their religion. Should we insist on keeping the partition even though some people may stop praying in the mosque, or should we remove it
although this may lead to people looking at the opposite sex?",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen answered this question as
    follows:
The partition should stay. The fact that there was no partition at the
    time of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was either because
    there was no need for it or because there was a reason why they could not have a
    partition. With regard to the former, the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased with them, had
    such strong faith in Allaah that they would not look at women; with regard to the latter,
    the financial situation of the Sahaabah, as we know, especially before the conquests, was
    one of hardship, and they could not afford to put a partition between themselves and the
    women. Having understood this, we should next look at which is further removed from
    fitnah, having a partition or not having it? Everyone will agree that having the partition
    is less likely to cause fitnah. If that is the case, then whatever is less likely to cause
    fitnah is what should be done. If you say, “If we insist on keeping it, those who
    want to remove it will stay away from the mosque,” our response is that if they stay
    away, they are doing wrong. They have no excuse for failing to pray in jamaa’ah
    because of this partition being there. Having the partition there is not a sin such that
    they could say, “We are not coming to be witnesses to sin.” If they stay away,
    they are committing sin by failing to attend prayers in congregation."

                Some brothers give a speech when someone is buried, for the purpose of preaching to the mourners. What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen,
    may Allaah preserve him, who replied:
“I think that this is an innovated bid’ah. No preacher can
    claim that he loves to preach to people more than the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. It is not reported anywhere that the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to stand up to address the people
    with a khutbah in the graveyard. All that is mentioned is that one day he came to a grave
    when the burial had not yet been completed. He sat down, and his companions sat down with
    him, and he started talking to them about what happens when a person is on his deathbed
    and after he dies. This is the nearest thing that has been reported, and anyone who stands
    up to preach to the people after a burial is doing so on the basis of incorrect ijtihaad.
Question:
But the fact that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) did this once…?
Answer:
He did not preach as such. He just started talking to the people who
    were sitting with him. It was not intended as preaching and he did not stand up to deliver
    a khutbah.
Question:
So if a person sits by the grave and others sit with him, and he tells
    them the hadeeth of Abu Dawood (the hadeeth of al-Bara’), would this action be OK
    according to sharee’ah?
Answer:
It is not OK according to sharee’ah, because the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not sit with the intention of
    preaching. He just sat down to wait until the burial was over. There is a difference
    between what happens by coincidence and what is done deliberately, and he never did this
    on any other occasion.

Men can wear rings made of platinum with two conditions:

That it is not an extravagance on the part of one who cannot afford to wear this kind of jewellery
That it should not cause any kind of fitnah (temptation), such as the man being young and perhaps causing fitnah by wearing it.

1085,4022,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4022,Ruling on one    spouse washing the other when he or she has died,"Question

A man died, and his wife gave birth a few hours later. Is it permissible for her to wash his body?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allah preserve him, who answered:
“No, because when she gave birth, the relationship between her and her husband came to an end. It is not permissible for her to wash him because now she is no longer his wife, and thus if she were to enter into a (new) marriage contact at this time, it would be valid.”
When a woman’s husband dies, she should observe the ‘iddah (waiting period or mourning period) of four months and ten days. If she is pregnant, her ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth. Once her ‘iddah is over or she has given birth, there is no longer any connection between them. It is permissible for a wife to wash her husband’s body, and vice versa, if this is still within the ‘iddah period, because the connection between husband and wife does not end merely because of death. The evidence for this from the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from (the cemetery of) al-Baqee’ and found me suffering a headache, saying ‘Oh, my head!’ He said, ‘No, O ‘Aa’ishah, it is I who should be saying, “Oh, my head!”’ Then he said, ‘What’s the matter? If you die before me, I will take care of you: I will wash your body, wrap you in your shroud, pray for you and bury you.’”
(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 1454; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkam al-Janaa’iz, page 50). It was reported that ‘Aa’ishah said, concerning the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “If I could go back and do things all over again, no one would wash him but his wives.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3733. Al-Albani classed its isnaad as saheeh in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 49).

   one’s hand on the Bible when swearing","Question

                What is the ruling on a Muslim placing
      his hand on the Tawraat (Torah – Old Testament) or the Injeel (Gospel – New
      Testament), or both (the Bible) when swearing an oath in court in a non-Muslim country,
      where the judicial system requires this of the one who is taking an oath?",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to swear by anything except Allaah,
        may He be exalted, alone, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
        said: “Whoever swears an oath, let him swear by Allaah, or else keep silent.”
It is not essential for a person swearing an oath to put his hand on the
        Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’an) for the oath to be valid, but some people do this to
        make the oath more binding, so that the person swearing the oath will be afraid to tell
        lies.
It is not permissible for the Muslim to put his hand on the Tawraat or
        Injeel when swearing an oath, because the copies in circulation are distorted, and are not
        the original Books that were revealed to Moosa and ‘Eesaa (peace be upon them); and
        because the Message with which Allaah sent His Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of
        Allaah be upon him) abrogates the messages that came before.
If the system in a country that is not ruled by Islamic law requires the
        person swearing an oath to put his hand on the Tawraat or Injeel, or both, then the Muslim
        should ask the court to let him swear by Allaah, may He be exalted. There is nothing wrong
        with him putting his hand on the Holy Qur’aan, which is the Word of Allaah and is
        therefore one of His attributes. If they do not allow him this request, and he is forced
        to swear by the Tawraat or Injeel, then this is considered to be compulsion, and there is
        no sin on him if he puts his hand on one or both of them, so long as he does not intend to
        show respect to them by doing so. And Allaah knows best."

  well-known imaams. It was reported in al-Saheeh that the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the woman who wails 
  does not repent before she dies, on the Day of Resurrection she will be wearing 
  a garment of scabs and pants made of melted tar.” In al-Sunan it 
  is reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) cursed the woman who wails and the one who listens to 
  her. In al-Saheeh it is reported that he said: “He is not one of 
  us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and says things like the people 
  of Jaahiliyyah say.” For women to uncover their faces where strangers (i.e., 
  men to whom they are not related) can see them is not permitted. The man who 
  is in charge must enjoin what is good and forbid this evil and others. Whoever 
  does not refrain from doing this should be punished in such a way as to make 
  them stop, especially women who wail at gravesides, because this is a sin that 
  is hated by Allaah and His Messenger, as it involves panic, lamenting and wailing. 
  It hurts the dead and causes fitnah (trial, temptation) to the living, and consumes 
  people’s wealth unlawfully. It makes people forget about the patience and 
  hope for reward enjoined upon them by Allaah, and it may lead to evil deeds. 
  The Muslims should put a stop to such practices. And Allaah knows best. May 
  Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions."

    you disbeliever, with quotes from the Word of God (the Qur’aan), if you even believe
    in the existence of God.
O disbeliever, we debate with you in the words addressed by Allaah (the
    Arabic name of the One True God) to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and the
    disbelievers. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed
    the limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Eesa
    (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary) was (no more than) a Messenger of Allaah and His Word
    (‘Be!’ – and he was), which He bestowed on Maryam, and a spirit created by
    Him; so believe in Allaah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease!

    is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in
    the earth. And Allaah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of Affairs.”
[al-Nisa’ 4:171]
“Say: O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do you
    criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in Allaah, and in (the revelation)
    which has been sent down before (us), and that most of you are faasiqoon (rebellious and
    disobedient [to Allaah])?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:59]
“How can you disbelieve in Allaah? Seeing that you were dead and
    He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the
    Day of Resurrection) and then unto Him you will return.”
[al-Baqarah 2:28]
“… whosoever disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books,
    His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away…
Verily, those who disbelieve in Allaah and His messengers and wish to
    make a distinction between Allaah and His Messengers (by believing in Allaah and

    with their mouths, but Allaah will not allow except that His Light should be perfected
    even though the disbelievers hate (it).”
[al-Tawbah 9:32]
O disbeliever, do you know that you are cursed if you do not submit to
    Allaah, so save yourself from this curse:
“Verily, Allaah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared
    for them a flaming Fire (Hell).”
[al-Ahzaab 33:64]
There is still time for you to repent from sin and transgression, so
    long as you are still alive. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from
    disbelief) their past will be forgiven. But if they return (thereto), then the examples of
    those (punished) before them have already preceded (as a warning).”
[al-Anfaal 8:38]
Whoever is guided, then it is for his own benefit, and whoever

What is the ruling on what people do on the day of Ashura, such as wearing kohl, taking a bath (ghusl), using henna, shaking hands with one another, cooking grains (huboob), showing their happiness and so on…? Has any saheeh hadeeth to that effect been narrated from the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or not? If there is no saheeh hadeeth to that effect, does doing these things constitute bid’ah, or not? What about the things that the other people do, such as mourning, grieving, going without anything to drink, eulogizing, wailing, rending their garments, etc.? Is there any basis for that or not?","1.	If a person misses the fast of ‘Ashoora’, it cannot be made up because there is no proof for that, and because the reward is connected to fasting on the tenth day of Muharram, and that time has passed. 
2.	If a person is excused for not fasting – such as women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth, or those who are sick or are travelling – and he usually fasts on that day or he had the intention of fasting that day, then he will be rewarded for his intention.","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked this question and he replied as follows:
‘Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Nothing to that effect has been reported in any saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his Companions. None of the imams of the Muslims encouraged or recommended such things, neither the four imams, nor any others. No reliable scholars have narrated anything like this, neither from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), nor from the Sahabah, nor from the Tabi'een; neither in any saheeh report or in a da’eef (weak) report; neither in the books of Saheeh, nor in al-Sunan, nor in the Musnads. No hadeeth of this nature was known during the best centuries, but some of the later narrators reported ahadeeth like the one which says “Whoever puts kohl in his eyes on the day of Ashura will not suffer from eye disease in that year, and whoever takes a bath (does ghusl) on the day of Ashura will not get sick in that year, etc.” They also narrated reports concerning the supposed virtues of praying on the day of Ashura, and other reports saying that on the day of Ashura Adam repented, the Ark settled on Mount Joodi, Yoosuf returned to Ya’qoob, Ibraheem was saved from the fire, the ram was provided for sacrifice instead of Ismaa’eel, and so on. They also reported a fabricated hadeeth that is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which says, “Whoever is generous to his family on the day of Ashura, Allah will be generous to him for the rest of the year.”
(Then Ibn Taymiyah discussed the two misguided groups who were in Koofah, Iraq, both of whom took Ashura as a festival because of their bid’ah). The Rafidi group made an outward show of allegiance to the Ahl al-Bayt although inwardly they were either heretics and disbelievers or ignorant and bound by whims and desires. The Nasibi group hated ‘Ali and his companions, because of the troubles and killings that had occurred. It is reported in Saheeh Muslim that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In (the tribe of) Thaqeef there will be a liar and an oppressor.” The liar was al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who made an outward show of allegiance to and support of the Ahl al-Bayt, and killed ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad, the governor of Iraq, who had equipped the party that killed al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both); then he (al-Mukhaar) made it clear that he was a liar, by claiming to be a prophet and that Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought revelation to him. People told Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas about this, and said to one of them, “al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd is claiming to receive revelation [annahu yanzilu ‘alayhi].” He said, “He is telling the truth, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Shall I inform you (O people) upon whom the shayateen (devils) descend [tanazzalu]? They descend upon every lying, sinful person.’ [al-Shu’ara’ 26:221].” [Translator’s note: the words translated as “receive revelation” and “descend” both come from the same root in Arabic]. They said to the other: “Al-Mukhtar is claiming that he receives inspiration.” He said, “he is telling the truth. ‘… And certainly, the Shayateen (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you…’ [al-An’aam 6:121 – interpretation of the meaning].” As for the oppressor , this was al-Hajjaj ibn Yoosuf al-Thaqafi, who was opposed to ‘Ali and his companions. Al-Hajjaj was a Nasibi and al-Mukhtar was a Rafidi, and this Rafidi was a greater liar and more guilty of fabrication and heresy, because he claimed to be a prophet…
There was much trouble and fighting between these two groups in Kufa. When al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both) was killed on the day of Ashura, he was killed by the sinful, wrongdoing group. Allah honoured al-Husayn with martyrdom, as He honoured other members of his family, and raised his status, as He honoured Hamzah, Ja’far, his father ‘Ali and others. Al-Husayn and his brother al-Hasan are the leaders of the youth of Paradise. High status can only be attained through suffering, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him said, when he was asked which people suffer the most. He said, “The Prophets, then righteous people, then the next best and the next best. A man will suffer according to his level of faith. If his faith is solid, he will suffer more, but if his faith is shaky, he will suffer less. The believer will keep on suffering until he walks on the earth with no sin.” (reported by al-Tirmidhi and others). Al-Hasan and al-Husayn achieved what they achieved and reached the high status they reached by the help and decree of Allah. They did not suffer as much as their forefathers had, for they were born and raised during the glory days of Islam, and the Muslims respected and honoured them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died when they were still young, and Allah blessed them by testing them in such a manner that they would be able to catch up with the rest of their family members, as those who were of a higher status than them were also tested. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib was better than them, and he was killed as a shaheed (martyr). The killing of al-Husayn was one of the things that caused fitnah (tribulation) among the people, as was the killing of ‘Uthman, which was one of the greatest causes of fitnah, because of which the ummah is still split today. Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three things, whoever is saved from them is truly saved: my death, the killing of a patient khaleefah, and the Dajjal (‘antichrist’).”
Then Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a little about the biography of al-Hasan and his just character, then he said:
“Then he died, and Allah was pleased with him and honoured him. Some groups wrote to al-Husayn and promised to support and help him if he went ahead and declared himself khaleefah, but they were not sincere. When al-Husayn sent his cousin [son of his paternal uncle] to them, they broke their word and gave help to the one they had promised to defend him against, and fought with him against [al-Husayn’s cousin]. Those who were wise and who loved al-Husayn, such as Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn ‘Umar and others, advised him not to go to them, and not to accept any promises from them. They thought that his going to them served no useful interest and that the consequences would not be good. Things turned out just as they said, and this is how Allah decreed it would happen. When al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) went out and saw that things were not as he had expected, he asked them to let him go back, or to let him join the army that was defending the borders of Islam, or join his cousin Yazeed, but they would not let him do any of these things unless he gave himself up to them as a prisoner. So he fought with them, and they killed him and some of those who were with him, and he was wrongfully slain so he died as a shaheed whose martyrdom brought him honour from Allah, and so he was reunited with the good and pure members of his family. His murder brought shame on those who had wrongfully killed him, and caused much mischief among the people. An ignorant, wrongful group – who were either heretics and hypocrites, or misguided and misled – made a show of allegiance to him and the members of his household, so they took the day of ‘Ashura as a day of mourning and wailing, in which they openly displayed the rituals of jahiliyyah such as slapping their cheeks and rending their garments, grieving in the manner of the jahiliyyah. But what Allah has commanded us to do when disaster strikes – when the disaster is fresh – is to bear it with patience and fortitude, and to seek reward, and to remember that all things come from Allah and we must return to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but give glad tidings to al-sabiroon (the patient ones), who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ They are those on whom are al-salawat (the blessings) (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157] .
It is reported in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “he is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and prays with the prayer of Jahiliyyah.” And he said: “I have nothing to do with those who strike [their cheeks], shave [their heads] and rend [their garments].” And he said: “If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, she will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection wearing trousers made of tar and a shirt of scabs.” In al-Musnad, it is reported from Faatimah bint al-Husayn, from her father al-Husayn, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no man who suffers a calamity, and when he remembers it, even if it is old, he says ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),’ but Allaah will give a reward equal to the reward He gave him on the day he suffered the calamity.” This is how Allaah honours the Believers. If the disaster suffered by al-Husayn, and other disasters, are mentioned after all this time, we should say “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),” as Allaah and His Messenger commanded, so as to be given the reward like that earned on the day of the disaster itself. If Allaah commanded us to be patient and steadfast and to seek reward at the time of the disaster, then how about after the passing of time? The Shaytaan made this attractive to those who are misled, so they took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as an occasion of mourning, when they grieve and wail, recite poems of grief and tell stories filled with lies. Whatever truth there may be in these stories serves no purpose other than the renewal of their grief and sectarian feeling, and the stirring up of hatred and hostility among the Muslims, which they do by cursing those who came before them, and telling many lies, and causing much trouble in the world. The various sects of Islam have never known any group tell more lies or cause more trouble or help the kuffaar against the Muslims more than this misguided and evil group. They are even worse than the Khawaarij who went beyond the pale of Islam. They are the ones of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “They will kill the people of Islam and will leave alone the people who worship idols.” This group cooperated with the Jews, Christians and mushrikeen against the members of the Prophet’s household and his believing ummah, and also helped the mushrik Turks and Tatars to do what they did in Baghdaad and elsewhere to the descendents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), i.e., the ‘Abbaasid rulers and others, and the believers; the Turks and Tatars killed them, enslaved their women and destroyed their homes. The evil and harm that they do to the Muslims cannot be enumerated by any man, no matter how eloquent he is. Some others – either Naasibis who oppose and have enmity towards al-Husayn and his family or ignorant people who try to fight evil with evil, corruption with corruption, lies with lies and bid’ah with bid’ah – opposed them by fabricating reports in favour of making the day of ‘Aashooraa’ a day of celebration, by wearing kohl and henna, spending money on one's children, cooking special dishes and other things that are done on Eids and special occasions. These people took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as a festival like Eid, whereas the others took it as a day of mourning. Both are wrong, and both go against the Sunnah, even though the other group (the Rafidis) are worse in intention and more ignorant and more plainly wrong… But Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those of you who live after my death will see many disputes. I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the sunnah of my rightly-guided successors (al-khulafa’ al-raashidoon) who come after me. Hold onto it as if biting it with your eyeteeth. Beware of newly-innovated matters, for every innovation is a going astray.” Neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) nor his rightly-guided successors (the khulafa’ al-raashidoon) did any of these things on the day of ‘Aashooraa’, they neither made it a day of mourning nor a day of celebration.
But “when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, he saw the Jews fasting on the day of ‘Aashooraa’. He said, ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘This is the day when Allaah saved Moosa from drowning, so we fast on this day.’ He said, ‘We have more right to Moosa than you,’ so he fasted on that day and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day.”
Quraysh also used to venerate this day during the Jaahiliyyah. The day on which people were ordered to fast was just one day. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah it was Rabee’ al-Awwal, and the following year he fasted ‘Aashooraa’ and commanded the people to fast. Then in that year fasting in Ramadaan was made obligatory and fasting on ‘Aashooraa’ was abrogated. The scholars disputed as to whether fasting on that day (‘Aashooraa’) was waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (encouraged). Of the two best known opinions, the more correct view is that it was waajib, then after that whoever fasted it did it because it was mustahabb. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell ordinary Muslims to fast on ‘Aashooraa’, but he used to say, “This is the day of ‘Aashooraa’; I am fasting on this day and whoever wishes to fast on this day may fast.” And he said: “Fasting on ‘Aashooraa’ expiates for the sins of one year and fasting on the day of ‘Arafaah expiates for the sins of two years.” When, towards the end of his life, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard that the Jews took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as a festival, he said, “If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the ninth” – to be different from the Jews, and not to resemble them in taking the day as a festival.
There were some of the Sahaabah and scholars who did not fast on this day and did not regard it as mustahabb, but thought it makrooh to single out this day for fasting. This was reported from a group of the Koofiyeen (scholars of Kufa). Some other scholars said that it was mustahabb to fast on this day. The correct view is that it is mustahabb for the one who fasts on ‘Aashooraa’ to fast on the ninth day [of Muharram] too, because this was the ultimate command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he said: “If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the ninth as well as the tenth.” This was reported with a variety of isnaads. This is what is prescribed in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
As for the other things, such as cooking special dishes with or without grains, or wearing new clothes, or spending money on one’s family, or buying the year’s supplies on that day, or doing special acts of worship such as special prayers or deliberately slaughtering an animal on that day, or saving some of the meat of the sacrifice to cook with grains, or wearing kohl and henna, or taking a bath (ghusl), or shaking hands with one another, or visiting one another, or visiting the mosques and mashhads (shrines) and so on… all of this is reprehensible bid’ah and is wrong. None of it has anything to do with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the way of the Khulafa’ al-Raashidoon. It was not approved of by any of the imaams of the Muslims, not Maalik, not al-Thawri, not al-Layth ibn Sa’d, not Abu Haneefah, not al-Oozaa’i, not al-Shaafa'i, not Ahmad ibn Hanbal, not Ishaaq ibn Raahwayh, not any of the imaams and scholars of the Muslims.
The religion of Islam is based on two principles: that we should worship nothing besides Allaah Alone, and that we should worship Him in the manner that He has prescribed, not by means of bid’ah or reprehensible innovations. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” [al-Kahf 18:110].
Righteous deeds are those which are loved by Allaah and His Messenger, those which are prescribed in Islam and in the Sunnah. Thus ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say in his du’aa’: “O Allaah, make all of my deeds righteous and make them purely for Your sake, and do not let there be any share for anyone or anything else in them.”
(The above is summarized from the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah have mercy on him. Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, part 5). And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.

                Some Muslims made da’wah to call a
      family, consisting of a husband and wife, to Islam. They embraced Islam and came together
      to the Islamic centre to declare their Islam. Do they have to do a new marriage contract

    then they keep their original marriage contract, whether this happens before the marriage
    is consummated or after. There is no dispute among the scholars on this matter, praise be
    to Allaah.
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr mentioned that there is scholarly consensus on
    the matter. The reason is that there is no difference of religion between the spouses. Abu
    Dawood reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a man came to declare his Islam at the time of
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then his wife came

                In the Islamic centres and when calling non-Muslim women to Islam, we are faced with the problem of the wife’s attachment to her kaafir husband who does not want to become Muslim. It is difficult for the woman to sacrifice her marriage, especially when the couple has children and the husband treats her well and she feels a great deal of love for him. We know that if a kaafir woman becomes Muslim it is not permissible for her to remain in a marriage with a kaafir man, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them…” [al-Mumtahinah 60:10]. How should we deal with this problem? Is it permissible for us to focus on the issue of the woman becoming Muslim and ignore the rest of the matter?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen: 
        A woman says, I want to become Muslim, and my husband 
          is good and I do not want to leave him. What should I do?
 He answered:
“She has to leave him, but is it possible for her to 
          call him to Islam? She could say, ‘I want to become Muslim, but if I 
          become Muslim, the marriage will become null and void unless you become 
          Muslim too.’ Hopefully if she says this to him, he will become Muslim 
          too.’”
 Question:
If she become Muslim, can she stay in the marital home 
          while she calls him to Islam, or should she leave?
 Answer:
“If she is hopeful that he will become Muslim, she can 
          stay in the marital home until the end of her ‘iddah (waiting period 
          following the dissolution of a marriage).”
 Question:
Can she uncover herself (go without hijab) during the 
          ‘iddah or not?
 Answer:
“To be on the safe side, she should not uncover, because 
          there is no certainty that he will agree to become Muslim.”
 Question:
And she should not be alone with him?
Answer:
“And she should not be alone with him.”
Question:
If telling her about this could turn her away from Islam, 
          is it permissible for us according to sharee’ah to conceal the second 
          part of the answer from her, so that we could tell her, “Become Muslim 
          first, then we will tell you about the ruling on staying with your husband”?
Answer:
“No, if we say this, and then we tell her about the ruling 
          and she leaves Islam (becomes an apostate), this will make the problem 
          worse. For this reason the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, 
          when he sent him to the people of Khaybar: ‘Call them to Islam and tell 
          them what they have to do in the way of duties towards Allaah.’”
Question:
So now if she continues to live with him after she becomes 
          Muslim she is guilty of a major sin (kabeerah)?
Answer:
“Yes that is the case, but she should not persist in 
          zinaa (unlawful sexual relationship).”
Question:
Briefly, how should we answer her?
Answer:
“Tell her: Become Muslim, and know that if you become 
          Muslim and your husband does not, the marriage will become null and 
          void.”
When we are talking to women who will be faced 
          with this issue, we should focus on the following points:
Giving 
          priority to love for Allaah and His Messenger over love for anyone else.
If she is sincere in calling him to Islam 
          and in praying for him, Allaah may guide him at her hands.
-Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will 
          compensate him or her with something better.
Allaah will never forsake His slave who 
          gives up something he or she loves for His sake.
When a woman like this becomes Muslim and leaves her 
          husband, one of the Muslim brothers should come forward to marry her 
          and take her children into his family, or good-hearted Muslims should 
          undertake the responsibility of spending in charity on her and her children. 
          We ask Allaah to guide us and grant us strength and help us to do the 
          right thing. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."
1099,4037,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4037,Ruling on    women spending of their own wealth without their husbands’ permission,"Question

                I am a working woman, and I have a salary from which I spend on myself and my home, I give some to my family and I give some in charity, and so on. Many of the arguments that I have with my husband arise because of the way I spend my money. Does my husband have the right to object to the way I spend my money? Do I have to ask for his permission when I want to spend any of my money?",,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the free adult person who is of sound mind and discernment is permitted to dispose of his own wealth with no restrictions as long as he is alive, whether he is buying, renting, giving a gift, establishing a waqf (endowment) or any other kind of transaction. There is no dispute among the scholars on this point.
There is also no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that the husband does not have the right to object to the way his wife handles her wealth in transactions such as buying, renting, etc., if the woman is of sound mind and there is no reason why she should not handle her own money and she is not one of those who may be tricked.
(Muraatib al-Ijmaa li Ibn Hazm, 162; al-Ijmaa fil-Fiqh al-Islami, Abu Habeeb, 2/566).
But the scholars differed as to whether a woman has the right to give all or some of her wealth in charity or as a gift without the permission of her husband. The details of their opinions are as follows:
The first opinion:
The husband has the right to prevent her from giving if the amount is more than one third of her wealth, but he does not have this right with regard to lesser amounts. This is the opinion of the Malikis and Hanbalis, and one of the two views narrated from Ahmad.
(Sharh al-Khurashi, 7/103; al-Mughni, 4/513; Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/22). The evidence for this is reports and qiyaas (analogy).
Among the reports referred to are the following:


The report that Khayrah, the wife of Kab ibn Maalik, came to the Prophet with some jewellery of hers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It is not permissible for a woman [to dispose of] her wealth without the permission of her husband. Have you asked Kabs permission? She said, Yes. So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent for Kab ibn Maalik, her husband, and asked him, Have you given permission to Khayrah to give her jewellery in charity? He said, Yes, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted it from her.


(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2380; its isnaad includes Abd-Allaah ibn Yahya and his father, who are majhool (not known, i.e., not enough information is known about them to ascertain whether they are trustworthy)).
The report narrated from Umar ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a khutbah (sermon) he gave: It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the permission of her husband.
(Sunan Abi Dawood, Buyoo, Baab 84; Sunan al-Nisaai, Zakaah, Baab 58; Musnad Ahmad, 2/179; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/798). According to another version: A woman has no right to her money if she is married. (Reported by five, except al-Tirmidhi).
These reports are taken as evidence that a woman does not have the right to spend her money except with her husbands permission, which means that the husbands permission is a condition any time she wants to spend; his right to stop her spending is limited to amounts over one-third of her wealth, because there are reports that indicate that the owner has the right to dispose of one-third or less of his wealth in his will, but he does not have the right to dispose of more than that without the permission of his heirs. This is seen in the famous story of Sad ibn Abi Waqqaas, who asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if he could give all of his wealth in charity, and he said, No. Sad asked, What about two-thirds? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No. Sad said, What about half? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No. Sad said, What about a third? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, [Yes,] a third, but a third is still a lot.
(Agreed upon)
With regard to their using qiyaas (analogy) as evidence, they say that the husbands rights are connected to the wifes wealth, on the basis of the hadeeth: A woman may be married for her wealth, her beauty or her religious commitment.
(Reported by the seven scholars).
Usually a husband increases his mahr because of the wifes wealth, and he will be able to spend her money, and if he cannot afford to spend on her, she will not complain (because she has her own money). This is similar to the rights of heirs in relation to a sick person's wealth.
(al-Mughni, 4/514).
The second opinion:
The husband has the right to stop his wife from spending in all cases, whether it is a small amount or a large amount, except in the case of insignificant things. This is the opinion of al-Layth ibn Sad.
(Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/22).
The third opinion:
The woman is not allowed to spend anything of her wealth at all, except with the permission of her husband. This is the opinion of Taawoos (Fath al-Baari, 5/218). Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath, and Taawoos used as evidence, the hadeeth of Umar ibn Shuayb, It is not permissible for a woman to give anything of her own wealth except with the permission of her husband. This was reported by Abu Dawood and al-Nisaai. Ibn Battaal said: The hadeeth narrated in this chapter are more sound.
The fourth opinion:
The woman has the right to spend her own money in all circumstances, whether in a transaction or otherwise, whether this involves all of her wealth or part of it. This is the opinion of the majority, and is the opinion of the Hanafis, Shaafais and Hanbalis, and of Ibn al-Mundhir.
(al-Mughni, 4/513; al-Ansaaf, 5/342; Maaani al-Athaar, 4/354; al-Baari, 5/318; al-Awtaar, 6/22).
This is the soundest opinion, and is most in accordance with the Quraan, the Sunnah and common sense.
In the Quraan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart, but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).[al-Nisa 4:4]
Allaah allows the husband to take what his wife gives him willingly.
Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning):
And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (mahr), unless the women agree to forego it[al-Baqarah 2:237]
Here Allaah allows women to give up as much of the mahr as they wish if their husbands divorce them, without them having to ask permission from anybody. This indicates that women have the right to decide what to do with their own money, and that a woman has rights to her wealth just as a man has rights to his wealth.
(Sharh al-Maaani al-Athaar, 4/352).
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their property to them [al-Nisa 4:6]
This clearly means that when the female orphan becomes wise and discerning, she is allowed to handle her own wealth.
Similarly, when the women gave their jewellery in charity after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had addressed them during his Eid sermon, this was an indication that they are allowed to dispose of their wealth without asking permission from anybody.
(See Ittihaaf al-Khilaan bi Huqooq al-Zawjayn fil-Islam by Dr. Fayhaan ibn Ateeq al-Mutayri, pp. 92-96).
It says in Nayl al-Awtaar: the majority of scholars agreed that women are allowed [to handle their own wealth] with no restrictions and without having to ask their husbands permission, so long as they are not foolish, but if they are foolish, it is not permitted. It says in al-Fath: The majority have a lot of evidence in the Quraan and Sunnah.
The majority of scholars argued against those who used as evidence the hadeeth It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the permission of her husband.
(Reported by Abu Dawood, 3079; Saheeh al-Jaami, 7265; some of its narrators have already been mentioned). The majority of scholars said that this has to do with the good manners and proper etiquette required of the wife because of the rights her husband has over her, and because of his status, experience in life and wisdom. Al-Sindi said in his commentary on al-Nisaai with regard to the hadeeth quoted: According to the majority of scholars, this has to do with good manners and making the husband feel good. It was reported from al-Shaafai that the hadeeth was not proven, so how can we use it as evidence when the Quraan, Sunnah, other reports and common sense indicate the opposite? Maymoonah freed a slave before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew anything about it, and he did not tell her off. This and other reports indicate that if this hadeeth is true, it is to be interpreted as being the matter of good manners, and the wife has the option either to ask her husbands permission or not.
So the Muslim woman is encouraged to seek her husbands permission but it is not obligatory for her to do so and she will be rewarded for doing that. Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked, Which woman is the best? He said, The one who makes [her husband] happy when he looks at her, who obeys him when he tells her to do something, and who does not oppose him in a manner he dislikes with regard to herself and her wealth.
(Reported by al-Nisaai, 3179; Saheeh al-Jaami, 3292).

                Is it permissible for a mother who has AIDS to have an abortion if she gets pregnant? Does she have the right to take care of the child? Is it permissible for either spouse to nullify the nikaah (marriage contract) if it is discovered that the other has AIDS?",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: abortion in the case of a mother 
          who has AIDS:
Because AIDS is not usually transmitted by a mother to 
          the foetus until the later stages of pregnancy – after the soul has 
          been breathed into the child – or during delivery, it is not permissible 
          according to sharee’ah for her to abort the foetus.
Secondly: a mother with AIDS taking care of 
          her healthy child and breastfeeding him:
Because current medical knowledge indicates that there 
          is no definite risk to the child from a mother who has AIDS, because 
          the way she deals with him is the ordinary way of mixing with people, 
          from the point of view of sharee’ah, there is no reason why the mother 
          should not take care of her child and breastfeed him, so long as there 
          is no medical report to state that she should not do so.
Thirdly: the right of the healthy spouse to 
          ask for separation from a spouse who has AIDS:
The wife has the right to demand separation from a husband 
          who has AIDS on the grounds that AIDS is a contagious disease that is 
          transmitted primarily through sexual contact."

    they recite it all together, in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, then this
    is not prescribed in Islam and at the very least it is makrooh (disliked), because it is
    not reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his
    Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) did any such thing. But if this is done for
    the purpose of teaching, we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is
    that the people gather to recite Qur’aan in order to memorize and learn it, and each
    one recites whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself – not in unison
    with the others – then this is permissible because it was reported that the Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No group of people
    gathers in one of the houses of Allaah to recite the Book of Allaah and study it together,
    but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them, mercy comes down upon them,

“(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down to
    you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding
    may remember.”[Saad 38:29]
A man will be rewarded for reading it whether he understands its
    meanings or not… But the believer should not read the Qur’aan without
    understanding at the time when he is responsible for his actions. If a person wants to
    learn medicine, for example, and studies medical books, he cannot learn anything from them
    unless he understands what they mean and it is explained to him. Indeed, he would very
    keen to understand what they say so that he can put it into practice. So how about the
    Book of Allaah which is healing for what is in people’s hearts and exhortation for
    all people? What about a person who reads it and does not understand or ponder its
    meanings? The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) would not go beyond ten aayaat
    until they had learnt them and understood the knowledge therein and how to act upon it. A
    person will be rewarded for reading Qur’aan whether or not he understands it, but he
    should try his best to find out what it means and to seek this knowledge from scholars who
    can be trusted. If he cannot easily find a scholar from whom he can learn, he should refer

1104,4043,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4043,Importance of    knowing the Beautiful Names of Allah,"Question

What is the importance of knowing the Beautiful Names of Allah?",,"Praise be to Allah.Knowing the Beautiful Names of Allah is very important indeed, for the following reasons:

Knowledge of Allah and His Names and Attributes is the noblest and best of all knowledge, because the level of honour of any kind of knowledge has to do with the object of knowledge, and the object of knowledge in this case is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, through His Names, Attributes and Deeds. Occupying oneself with seeking this knowledge and studying it properly is the pursuit of the highest objective, and acquiring this knowledge is one of the best gifts a person may be given. Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained it very clearly and was very keen to do so, the Sahaabah never disputed in this matter as they did over some of the rulings (ahkaam).
Knowing Allah makes a person love and fear Him, and put his hope in Him, and be sincere towards Him in his actions. This is the essence of human happiness. There is no way to know Allah except by knowing His Most Beautiful Names and seeking a proper understanding of their meanings.
Knowing Allah by His Most Beautiful Names increases ones faith, as Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Believing in and knowing the Most Beautiful Names of Allah includes the three types of Tawheed: Tawheed al-Ruboobiyyah (Unity of Divine Lordship), Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Unity of the Divine Nature) and Tawheed al-Asma wal-Sifaat (Unity of the Divine Names and Attributes). These three types of Tawheed form the essence and joy of faith (the word translated here as joy implies peace and relief from stress), and this knowledge is the basis and purpose of faith. The more a person learns about the Names and Attributes of Allah, the more his faith increases and the stronger his conviction becomes.

(Al-Tawdeeh wal-Bayaan li Shajarat al-Eemaan by al-Sadi, p. 41).
Allah created His creatures to know Him and worship Him. This is what is expected from them and what they are required to do, because as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The key to the call of the Messengers, the essence of their Message, is knowing Allah through His Names and Attributes and Deeds, because this is the foundation on which the rest of the Message, from beginning to end, is built.
(Al-Sawaaiq al-Mursalah ala al-Jahamiyyah wal-Muattilah by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/150-151). So when a person occupies himself with learning about Allah, he is doing what he was created for, but if he ignores the matter, he is neglecting what he was created for. The meaning of faith is not merely to utter words without knowing Allah, because true faith in Allah means that the slave knows the Lord in Whom he believes, and he makes the effort to learn about Allah through His Names and Attributes. The more he learns about his Lord, the more he increases in faith.
Knowledge of the Names of Allah is the basis for all other knowledge, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Knowledge of the Most Beautiful Names of Allah is the basis of all other kinds of knowledge, for the objects of all these other branches of knowledge were either created or commanded by Him (the various branches of knowledge either deal with objects created by Him or with the laws and guidance revealed by Him). The reason for creation and guidance is found in His Most Beautiful Names (because He is the Creator, He creates things; because He is the Guide to the Straight Path, He reveals guidance, and so on) Knowing the Most Beautiful Names is the basis of all objects of knowledge, because all knowledge stems from these Names
(Badai' al-Fawaaid by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/163)."

                In the city where we live in the West, there is no Islamic court or Islamic centre to which we can refer for judgement or for help to resolve conflicts. We have an Islamic Da’wah centre but there is no director or anyone we can refer to resolve conflicts. Can a wife’s agreement before a kaafir judge to give up custody of her children be regarded as binding? Can a kaafir judge’s verdict that a father has to spend on his children if they are with the mother be regarded as binding?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
Firstly – may Allaah bless you – if the people at the Da’wah centre agree that matters may be referred to them, then this is OK. This is a duty upon them, because we should refer things to Muslims for judgements.
But with regard to the issue of giving up custody – if the mother gives up custody – this does not need the ruling of a judge. If she states that, this is sufficient for it to become binding.
As for spending on the children, so long as they are going to go back to their father when the mother gives up her right to custody, he is going to spend on them anyway.
Question:
If the kaafir judge rules that the father has to spend on them whilst they are with their mother, is this considered to be binding?
Answer:
Even if the judge does not state that the father has to spend on them, it is still his obligation according to sharee’ah.
Question:
But the amount?
Answer:
The amount is to be determined by ‘Urf (local custom).
Question:
So if the amount stipulated by the kaafir judge is in accordance with ‘Urf, is it binding on him?
Answer:
It is binding on him not because it is the ruling of the judge but because it is ‘Urf.
Question:
If the husband and wife agree to refer to a Muslim for judgement, is his ruling binding on them? In the West, the imaam may be a person who is not religious, so can they refer to him for judgement?
Answer:
If there is no one else available, then it is OK, but the fuqaha’ have stated the condition that he should be fit to judge, meaning that he should have knowledge of sharee’ah, but if there is no one else, let them fear Allaah as much as they can.
Question:
There may be no one there at all who knows about passing judgement, but if there is a wise Muslim man?
Answer:
If they ask him to judge between them on the basis that he is going to bring about a reconciliation, this is OK.
Question:
But if we say that it is only for reconciliation, his words will not be binding?
Answer:
No, but if he passes a judgement and they agree to it, then it will become binding. Every reconciliation that the two parties agree to is binding because of the hadeeth: “Reconciliation is permissible among Muslims”. And Allaah knows best."

      group?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad Saalih
    ibn ‘Uthaymeen, who replied as follows:
“If the Muslim students agree on something, this is OK, but
    if each Muslim group is adopting its own symbol, it is not right. The symbol or color that
    we recommend is bright green.”
Is there any daleel (evidence) for this color?
“No, but people like this color and in the Qur’aan it
    says (interpretation of the meanings): ‘Their garments will be of fine green
    silk’ [al-Insaan 76:21] and ‘Reclining on green cushions’
    [al-Rahmaan 55:76].”
Is there any indication from the reports that the Prophet SAWS
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had white and black banners that these colors
    are mustahabb in such cases?
“No, we cannot use these colors, because these were the
    banners in that time, and each era has things that are appropriate for it. But black now
    is one of the symbols of the Raafidah, as is well known.”
The crescent is commonly used as a symbol by Muslims to
    distinguish themselves from Christian groups who use the cross as a symbol. Is it
    permissible for us to use the crescent as a symbol in our publications and on our banners,
    to distinguish ourselves from other, non-Muslim groups?
“I do not think this is right, because the crescent was
    originally a symbol that was placed on graves that were worshipped instead of Allah. We
    read this in an answer given by some scholars and leaders of Daw’ah. But we could use
    a picture of the Ka’bah as a symbol, because it is the Qiblah of all Muslims.”
In some countries they put a crescent on Muslim places of
    worship to distinguish them from Christian places of worship, which have crosses on top of
    them. They do this so that people can tell them apart from a distance, because the
    architecture is often similar. Can we say that putting a crescent on the mosques or
    minarets of the Muslims is bid’ah?
“It is as you say (i.e., we can say that). It is sufficient
    for a mosque not to have a Christian symbol on it. Symbols may be something that is
    present, or something that is not present. If the Christians have a symbol, namely the
    cross, then the fact that the Muslims have no symbol is in itself a symbol. (i.e., we do
    not need to put anything).

If it is identified by the owner, then hand it over to him, otherwise the finder can keep it after one year, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave instructions to this effect. An exception is made in the case of lost property found in Al-Haramayn (Makkah and Madeenah) – the finder cannot keep it, and it should be announced indefinitely until its owner is found, or the finder can hand it over to the authorities in charge of the Haramayn so that they can keep it for the owner, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning Makkah, “Property lost in Makkah is not permissible for anyone except its owner.” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have made Madeenah sacred just as Ibraaheem made Makkah sacred.” The authenticity of the hadith is agreed upon.
But if the property is of insignificant value and the owner will not be bothered about it, such as a rope or shoelace or a small amount of money, then the finder does not have to announce it, and he can make use of it or give it in charity on behalf of the owner. This does not apply in the case of lost camels and other animals that are safe from small predators such as wolves etc.. It is not permissible to keep these animals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the one who asked him about that: “Leave it alone, for it has its feet and its water, and it can eat the trees until it finds its owner.” (Agreed upon).

    it.” The reason behind this is that if the lost property is left where it is, its
    owner will probably come back and find it. On this basis, we say to this brother: you have
    to announce it in Makkah, in and around the place where you found it, such as at the doors
    of the mosque and in places where people gather, otherwise you should hand it in to those
    whose job it is to take care of lost property etc. Fatawa Islamiyah, 2/311.

It does not count, because what is more likely is that he did not catch
    up with the imaam. So he has to do the prostration of forgetfulness (sajdat al-sahw)
    at the end of the rak’ah that he does after the imaam says the salaam, because he is
    doing a rak’ah on his own and is not sure whether this is an extra rak’ah or

1. If someone is not a qadiani but knows that they believe in a false prophet and accepts qadianis as a madhab in Islam, are they out of Islam? I believe that they are out of Islam, and I am acting on that belief in my conduct towards such people.",,"Praise be to Allah.Definition:
Qadianiyyah is a movement that started in 1900 CE as a plot by the British colonialists in the Indian subcontinent, with the aim of diverting Muslims away from their religion and from the obligation of jihaad in particular, so that they would not oppose colonialism in the name of Islam. The mouthpiece of this movement is the magazine Majallat Al-Adyaan (Magazine if Religions) which was published in English.
Foundation and prominent personalities:


Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani (1839-1908 CE) was the main tool by means of which Qadianiyyah was founded. He was born in the village of Qadian, in the Punjab, in India, in 1839 CE. He came from a family that was well known for having betrayed its religion and country, so Ghulam Ahmad grew up loyal and obedient to the colonialists in every sense. Thus he was chosen for the role of a so-called prophet, so that the Muslims would gather around him and he would distract them from waging jihaad against the English colonialists. The British government did lots of favours for them, so they were loyal to the British. Ghulam Ahmad was known among his followers to be unstable, with a lot of health problems and dependent on drugs.


Among those who confronted him and his evil da’wah was Shaykh Abu’l-Wafa’ Thana’ al-Amritsari, the leader of Jama’iyyat Ahl al-Hadeeth fi ‘Umoom al-Hind (The All-India Society of Ahl al-Hadeeth). The Shaykh debated with him and refuted his arguments, revealing his ulterior motives and Kufr and the deviation of his way. When Ghulam Ahmad did not come to his senses, Shaykh Abu’l-Wafa’ challenged him to come together and invoke the curse of Allaah, such that the one who was lying would die in the lifetime of the one who was telling the truth. Only a few days passed before Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani died, in 1908 CE, leaving behind more than fifty books, pamphlets and articles, among the most important of which are: Izaalat al-Awhaam (Dispelling illusions), I’jaaz Ahmadi (Ahmadi miracles), Baraaheen Ahmadiyyah (Ahmadi proofs), Anwaar al-Islam (Lights of Islam), I’jaaz al-Maseeh (Miracles of the Messiah), al-Tableegh (Conveying (the message))and Tajalliyyaat Ilaahiyyah (Divine manifestations).


Noor al-Deen (Nuruddin): the first Khaleefah of the Qadianis. The British put the crown of Khilaafah on his head, so the disciples (of Ghulam Ahmad) followed him. Among his books is: Fasl al-Khitaab (Definitive statement).


Muhammad Ali and Khojah Kamaal al-Deen: the two leaders of the Lahore Qadianis. They are the ones who gave the final shape to the movement. The former produced a distorted translation into English of the Qur’aan. His other works include: Haqeeqat al-Ikhtilaaf (The reality of differences), al-Nubuwwah fi’l-Islam (Prophethood in Islam) and al-Deen al-Islami (The Islamic religion). As for Khojah Kamaal al-Deen, he wrote a book called al-Mathal al-A’laa fi’l-Anbiya’ (The highest example of the Prophets), and other books. This Lahore group of Ahmadis are those who think of Ghulam Ahmad as a Mujaddid (renewer or reviver of Islam) only, but both groups are viewed as a single movement because odd ideas that are not seen in the one will surely be found in the other.


Muhammad Ali: the leader of the Lahore Qadianis. He was one of those who gave the final shape to Qadianiyyah, a colonialist spy and the person in charge of the magazine which was the voice of the Qadianiyyah. He also produced a distorted translation into English of the Qur’aan. Among his works are Haqeeqat al-Ikhtilaaf (The reality of differences), and al-Nubuwwah fi’l-Islam (Prophethood in Islam), as stated above.


Muhammad Saadiq, the mufti of the Qadianiyyah. His works include: Khatim al-Nabiyyeen The seal of the Prophets).


Basheer Ahmad ibn Ghulam. His works include: Seerat al-Mahdi (the life of the Mahdi) and Kalimat al-Fasl (Decisive word).


Mahmood Ahmad ibn Ghulam, his second Khaleefah. Among his works are: Anwaar al-Khilaafah (Lights of the caliphate), Tuhfat al-Mulook and Haqeeqat al-Nubuwwah (The reality of prophethood).


The appointment of the Qadiani Zafar-Allaah Khan as the first Foreign Minister of Pakistan had a major effect in supporting this deviant sect, as he gave them a large area in the province of the Punjab to be their world headquarters, which they named Rabwah (high ground) as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… And We gave them refuge on high ground (rabwah), a place of rest, security and flowing streams.” [al-Mu’minoon 23:50].


Their thought and beliefs


Ghulam Ahmad began his activities as an Islamic daa’iyah (caller to Islam) so that he could gather followers around him, then he claimed to be a mujaddid inspired by Allaah. Then he took a further step and claimed to be the Awaited Mahdi and the Promised Messiah. Then he claimed to be a Prophet and that his prophethood was higher than that of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).


The Qadianis believe that Allaah fasts, prays, sleeps, wakes up, writes, makes mistakes and has intercourse – exalted be Allaah far above all that they say.


The Qadiani believes that his god is English because he speaks to him in English.


The Qadianis believe that Prophethood did not end with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but that it is ongoing, and that Allaah sends a messenger when there is a need, and that Ghulam Ahmad is the best of all the Prophets.


They believe that Jibreel used to come down to Ghulam Ahmad and that he used to bring revelation to him, and that his inspirations are like the Qur’aan.


They say that there is no Qur’aan other than what the “Promised Messiah” (Ghulam Ahmad) brought, and no hadeeth except what is in accordance with his teachings, and no Prophet except under the leadership of Ghulam Ahmad.


They believe that their book was revealed. Its name is al-Kitaab al-Mubeen and it is different from the Holy Qur’aan.


They believe that they are followers of a new and independent religion and an independent Sharee’ah, and that the friends of Ghulam are like the Sahaabah.


They believe that Qadian is like Madeenah and Makkah, if not better than them, and that its land is sacred. It is their Qiblah and the place they make hajj to.


They called for the abolition of jihaad and blind obedience to the British government because, as they claimed, the British were “those in authority” as stated in the Qur’aan.


In their view every Muslim is a Kaafir unless he becomes a Qadiani, and everyone who married a non-Qadiani is also a kaafir.


They allow alcohol, opium, drugs and intoxicants.


Intellectual and ideological roots
The westernizing movement of Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan paved the way for the emergence of the Qadianiyyah, because it had already spread deviant ideas.
The British made the most of this opportunity so they started the Qadiani movement and chose a man from a family that had a history of being agents of the colonialists.
In 1953 CE, there was a popular revolution in Pakistan which demanded the removal of Zafar-Allaah Khan from the position of Foreign Minister and that the Qadiani sect should be regarded as a non-Muslim minority. In this uprising around ten thousand Muslims were martyred, and they succeeded in having the Qadiani minister removed from office.
In Rabee’ al-Awwal 1394 AH (April 1974), a major conference was held by the Muslim World League in Makkah, which was attended by representatives of Muslim organizations from around the world. This conference announced that this sect is Kaafir and is beyond the pale of Islam, and told Muslims to resist its dangers and not to cooperate with the Qadianis or bury their dead in Muslim graveyards.
The Majlis al-Ummah in Pakistan (the central parliament) debated with the Qadiani leader Mirza Naasir Ahmad, and he was refuted by Shaykh Mufti Mahmood (may Allaah have mercy on him). The debate went on for nearly thirty hours but Naasir Ahmad was unable to give answers and the Kufr of this group was exposed, so the Majlis issued a statement that the Qadianis should be regarded as a non-Muslim minority.
Among the factors that make Mirza Ghulam Ahmad an obvious Kaafir are the following:


His claim to be a Prophet


His abolition of the duty of jihaad, to serve the interests of the colonialists.

His saying that people should no longer go on Hajj to Makkah, and his substitution of Qadian as the place of pilgrimage.

His anthropomorphism or likening Allaah to human beings.


His belief in the transmigration of souls and incarnation.


His attributing a son to Allaah and his claim to be the son of God.


His denying that Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his regarding the door of Prophethood to be open to “any Tom, Dick or Harry”.


The Qadianis have strong ties with Israel. Israel has opened centres and schools for them, and helped them to publish a magazine which is their mouthpiece, to print books and publications for distribution worldwide.
The fact that they are influenced by Judaism, Christianity and al-Baatiniyyah is clear from their beliefs and practices, even though they claim to be Muslims.
Their spread and positions of influence


Most of the Qadianis nowadays live in India and Pakistan, with a few in Israel and the Arab world. They are trying, with the help of the colonialists, to obtain sensitive positions in all the places where they live.


The Qadianis are very active in Africa and in some western countries. In Africa they have more than 5,000 teachers and dai’yahs working full-time to call people to Qadianiyyah. Their wide-spread activity proves that they have the support of the colonialists.


The British government is also supporting this movement and making it easy for their followers to get positions in world governments, corporate administration and consulates. Some of them are also high-ranking officers in the secret services.


In calling people to their beliefs, the Qadianis use all kinds of methods, especially educational means, because they are highly-educated and there are many scientists, engineers and doctors in their ranks. In Britain there is a satellite TV channel called Islamic TV which is run by the Qadianis.


From the above, it is clear that:
Qadianiyyah is a misguided group, which is not part of Islam at all. Its beliefs are completely contradictory to Islam, so Muslims should beware of their activities, since the ‘Ulama’ (scholars) of Islam have stated that they are Kaafirs.

The following statement was published by the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami):
After discussing the question put to the Islamic Fiqh Council in Capetown, South Africa, concerning the ruling on the Qadianis and their off-shoot which is known as Lahoriyyah, and whether they should be counted as Muslims or not, and whether a non-Muslim is qualified to examine an issue of this nature:
In the light of research and documents presented to the members of the council concerning Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani, who emerged in India in the last century and to whom is attributed the Qadiani and Lahori movements, and after pondering the information presented on these two groups, and after confirming that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to be a prophet who received revelation, a claim which is documented in his own writings and speeches, some of which he claimed to have received as revelation, a claim which he propagated all his life and asked people to believe in, just as it is also well-known that he denied many other things which are proven to be essential elements of the religion of Islam
in the light of the above, the Council issued the following statement:
Firstly: the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a prophet or a messenger and to receive revelation are clearly a rejection of proven and essential elements of Islam, which unequivocally states that Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that no revelation will come to anyone after him. This claim made by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad makes him and anyone who agrees with him an apostate who is beyond the pale of Islam. As for the Lahoriyyah, they are like the Qadianiyyah: the same ruling of apostasy applies to them despite the fact that they described Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as a shadow and manifestation of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
Secondly: it is not appropriate for a non-Muslim court or judge to give a ruling on who is a Muslim and who is an apostate, especially when this goes against the consensus of the scholars and organizations of the Muslim Ummah. Rulings of this nature are not acceptable unless they are issued by a Muslim scholar who knows all the requirements for being considered a Muslim, who knows when a person may be deemed to have overstepped the mark and become an apostate, who understands the realities of Islam and kufr, and who has comprehensive knowledge of what is stated in the Qur’aan, Sunnah and scholarly consensus. The ruling of a court of that nature is invalid. And Allaah knows best.

      until the end of her life. Also if my mother takes her share which is half (since she was an active
      partner in my fathers business) and distributes the rest of my fathers wealth according to
      shareeah, can she gift a part of her share to any of her children. To be more specific, if
      she favours one child by buying him a house with her share, will that house be distributed
      amongst all the children after her death. How can one prove that the mother gave the house
      as a gift and did not leave it behing to be distributed amongst the other children. Can
      she add this in her will. Must all the other children agree to this agreement and sign it
      etc...Please let me know soon.",,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning the estate of 
  the deceased is that it should be shared out among the heirs after the person 
  has died, and after the funeral expenses and any outstanding debts to Allaah 
  (e.g., zakaah) and other people have been paid, and any specific bequests that 
  may have been made have been dealt with. It is disliked (makrooh) to delay sharing 
  out the estate, because of the harm that this may cause to the heirs, but if 
  all the heirs agree to delay it, there is nothing wrong with this. If your mother 
  was a partner in your father’s business, then she should take her share 
  of the company, then she is entitled to one-eighth of your father’s estate, 
  then with regard to you and your siblings, the males are entitled to the share 
  of two females, if the deceased’s parents are no longer alive. If you and 
  your mother want to leave everything as it is, and let the business continue 
  operating, there is nothing wrong with this; it is clear what each person’s 
  share is, and whenever one of you wants to ask for it, he may take it.
It is not permissible for the mother to give 
  something to one of her children and not the others, because of the hadeeth 
  narrated by al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him), who 
  said: “My father gave me some of his wealth as a gift, and my mother said, 
  ‘I will not accept this until you ask the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to be a witness to this.’ So 
  my father went to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) to ask him to be a witness to the gift, and the Messenger 
  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) said, ‘Have you done this for all your children?’ He said, ‘No.’ 
  He said, ‘Fear Allaah and treat all your children fairly.’ So my father 
  came back and took back the gift.” (Agreed upon).
For more detail on this topic and answers to 
  the rest of your question, please see Question #1151. 
  It is not permissible for a mother to bequeath anything to one of her heirs, 
  because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
  be upon him) said: “There is no bequest to the heir.” (Kashf 
  al-Qinaa’, 4/342; Ghaayat al-Muntahaa, 2/335; al-Mughni, 
  5/604). If she does, her bequest should not be carried out."
1121,4094,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4094,Dealing With Evil Within Oneself,"Question

What should one do if he sees that he has inherent evil in him; such that, the evil outweighs the good?",,"Praise be to Allah.Man is a weak being, who feels inclinations towards both good and evil. He may be weak and be tempted to follow the path of immorality and deviation, and evil may push him to the way of wrongdoing and transgression. The Shaytaan may make evil deeds attractive to him, and justify every deviant action to him.
But the element of good may stir his conscience, make him feel regret and push him to come back to the truth and respond to the call of reason.
People vary with regard to their capability, willpower, purity of soul and spirituality. Some of them train themselves to follow the way of virtue, noble deeds and right attitudes, so they resist their desires and deviant inclinations, and make themselves adhere to the straight and right way. These people can confront evil and bear all kinds of hardship for that purpose. They never lose hope that good will prevail and evil will be defeated.
Others follow their desires and cannot adhere to what is right. They ignore many of the commands of Allaah and His Messenger, and are too weak to confront evil. So they have no hope that good will prevail. It all depends on whether or not a person is striving against his desires and his own self that bids him to do evil, so that he will receive guidance from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]
There follow some beautiful expressions of this striving, as uttered by Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him:
“O feet of patience, keep going, for what remains is only a little. Remember the sweetness of worship, then the bitterness of striving will become easier for you.”
(al-Fawaa’id)
“Go out to the field of struggle and strive to sow seeds. Irrigate the tree of regret with the water of tears…”
(Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id, 3/742)
“It was said: Love is sincerity in striving to obey the commands of Allaah and pure sincerity in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”
(Tareeq al-Hijratayn, 1/460)
“Whoever gives up striving completely, his religious motives will become weak and his motive to follow his desires will become strong, but when he trains himself to go against his desires, he can defeat them whenever he wants.”
(‘Uddat al-Saabireen, 1/46)
The believer who is striving knows that goodness will remain and will prevail, no matter how intense the darkness, how great the calamity, how prevalent and widespread the evil and how many limits are transgressed. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek."

      you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not
      with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed
      with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah
      will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.”
      [al-Nisaa’ 4:140]
 Some
      people who had been drinking wine were brought to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd
      al-‘Azeez (may Allaah have mercy on him) and he commanded that they
      should be flogged. One of them offered the excuse that he had not actually
      been drinking, but ‘Umar commanded that he should be flogged along with
      the others, and he recited this aayah to him. And Allaah knows best.
 Concerning
      Abu Thawr, this is a brief glance at his biography:
 His name
      was Ibraaheem ibn Khaalid. His kunyas (agnomen, nicknames) were Abu
      ‘Abd-Allaah and Abu Thawr, and he is best known by the latter.
 He was
      born in Haroor in 170 AH. He was one of the fuqahaa’ of Iraq, and one of
      the scholars of hadeeth. Imaam Ahmad praised him by saying, “I know that
      this man has been following the Sunnah – i.e., the correct belief –
      for fifty years.”
 He lived
      for seventy years or more, and died in 240 AH."

                Is tattooing permissible in Islam?",,"Praise be to Allah.Tattooing means to prick the skin with a needle and
    inject kohl or some other substance to change the skin colour to blue or green. This is
    haraam according to the consensus of the scholars. (al-Mughni 1/94)
    Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah

      said you have to leave him but it isn't easy I have three childern with him, and he is
      good father and husband. The problem between us is the DEEN. Please what shoul I do.",,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih
    al-Uthaymeen:
I am married to a man who neglects his prayer. Allaah has guided me and
    I insisted that he should pray, so he started to pray as if he was forced to do so. He has
    clearly told me, I am only praying because of you. Is it permissible for me to
    stay with him or not?
The shaykh  may Allaah preserve him  answered as follows:
If the marriage contract was made at the time when he was not praying,
    then it is not valid, and if this is the case then she has to keep away from him. If he
    becomes Muslim, the contract is renewed, and if he does not become Muslim, then Allaah
    will send her a Muslim man who is better than him.
Question:
If she got married to him when she too was not praying, and he was not
    praying, does this make the marriage null and void?
Answer:
If they were following a certain religion, then the marriage remains
    valid, but if they were not following any religion and were murtadd (apostates), then many
    of the scholars say that the marriage of apostates is not valid, because they are not
    following any religion, neither Islam nor the religion from which they apostatized.
Question:
If the husband who is praying clearly tells his wife that he is praying
    only for her sake, is that sufficient to count him as a murtadd (apostate), or should she
    go by what she sees, which is that he is praying?
Answer:
It seems to me that he is praying to Allaah to please her. This does
    not means that his whole prayer, the standing, bowing, prostrating and duaa,
    is directed towards her. He is praying to Allaah to please her, and that does not make him
    a mushrik. And Allaah knows best."

2)The scripture revealed to Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is lost but it is mentioned in the Noble Quran in different chapters? Give two references from two chapters in the Noble Quran mentioning this scripture.

3)Which country has the highest Muslim population? How did the people of this country become Muslims?",,"Praise be to Allah.
    1. The Quran indicates that Y’aqub (peace be upon him) gave final 
    instructions to his sons before he died. “… he said unto his sons, ‘What 
    will you worship after me?’ They said, ‘We shall worship your Ilah (God — 
    Allah) the Ilah (God) of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma‘il, Ishaq, One Ilah 
    (God), and to Him we submit (in Islam).’” [2:133 – interpretation of the 
    meaning].
    2. The scripture of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is mentioned in Surat 
    al-A’ala 87:19 (interpretation of the meaning): “The Scriptures of Ibrahim 
    and Musa”; and in Surat al-Najm 53:36-37 (interpretation of the meaning): 
    “Or is he not informed with what is in the Pages (Scripture) of Musa (Mose), 
    and of Ibrahim who fulfilled (or conveyed) all that (Allah ordered him to do 
    or convey).” 
    3. The country with the largest Muslim population in Africa is Nigeria, and 
    in Asia, Indonesia. The Indonesians became Muslim through contact with 
    Muslim traders from Hadramawt as is well known. Perhaps this is what the

      prostrated.”
  
      
 This

 1.Its isnaad is very

In our offices and workplaces we can hardly find time to do acts of worship and righteous deeds. What can we do in the short time that we can find in our day? How can we make use of it?",,"Praise be to Allah.Time is of the essence, it is too precious to be wasted or neglected. The wise person is the one who pays attention to his time and does not treat it as a vessel to be filled with cheap things and vain talk. Instead, he limits it to worthy efforts and righteous deeds that please Allaah and benefit other people. Every minute of a person’s life carries the potential to raise his own status and to make his people happier, little by little.
 If you are keen to attain the highest position, and bring the most happiness to your people, then forget about relaxing and keep away from empty amusement.
 In one minute you can do a lot of good and earn much reward. In just one minute, by giving in charity, studying, memorizing, or striving to do good deeds, you can make sure that this minute of your life is not wasted.  One minute may be recorded in your book of good deeds if you know how to make the most of it and take care of it:
 Strive to make the most of each minute
If you forget it, you forget the most important thing, the truth.
 There follows a list of things that can be done in one minute, by the permission of Allaah:
1.     1.     In one minute you can recite Soorat al-Faatihah 3 times, reciting rapidly and silently. Some scholars said that the reward for reading al-Faatihah is more than 600 hasanahs, so if you read it 3 times you will, by the permission of Allaah, gain more than 1800 hasanahs – all of that in one minute.
2.     In one minute you can recite Soorat al-Ikhlaas (Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad) 20 times, reciting rapidly and silently. Reciting it once is equivalent to one-third of the Qur’aan. If you read it 20 times it is equivalent to reading the Qur’aan 7 times. If you read it 20 times in one minute each day, you will have read it 600 times in one month, and 7200 times in one year, which will be equal in reward to reading the Qur’aan 2400 times.
3.     You can read one page of the Book of Allaah in one minute.
4.     You can memorize a short aayah of the Book of Allaah in one minute.
5.     In one minute you can say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer (There is no god except Allaah alone with no partner; to Him be dominion and praise, and He is Able to do all things) – 20 times. The reward for saying this is like freeing 8 slaves for the sake of Allaah from among the sons of Ismaa’eel.
6.     In one minute you can say Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah) 100 times. Whoever says that in one day will be forgiven for his sins even if they are like the foam of the sea.
7.     In one minute you can say Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty) 50 times. These are two phrases which are light on the lips, heavy in the balance and beloved to the Most Merciful, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim.
8.     The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When I say ‘Subhaan Allaah, wa’l-hamdu Lillah, wa laa ilaah ill-Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar (Glory be to Allaah, praise be to Allaah, there is no god except Allaah, and Allaah is Most Great)’, this is more beloved to me than all that the sun rises upon.” (Narrated by Muslim). In one minute, you can say all of these words more than 18 times. These words are the most beloved words to Allaah, the best of words, and they weigh heavily in the balance of good deeds, as was narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth.
9.     In one minute you can say, Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is no strength and no power except with Allaah) more than 40 times. This is one of the treasures of Paradise, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. They are a means of putting up with difficulties and of aiming to achieve great things.
10. In one minute you can say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah approximately 50 times. This is the greatest word, for it is the word of Tawheed, the good word, the word that stands firm. If these are the last words of a person, he will enter Paradise, and there are other reports which indicate how great these words are.
11. In one minute you can say Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa ridaa nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa midaada kalimaatihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of His words) more than 15 times. This words bring many more times the reward for other forms of tasbeeh and dhikr, as was reported in saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
12. In one minute you can seek the forgiveness of Allaah more than 100 times by saying “Astaghfir-Allaah (I seek the forgiveness of Allaah). The virtues of seeking forgiveness are no secret, for it is the means of attaining forgiveness and entering Paradise, and it is the means of being granted a good life, increasing one’s strength, warding off disasters, making things easier, bringing rain and increasing one’s wealth and children.
13. You can say a few brief and concise words in one minute, and Allaah may bring about some good through them that you could never imagine.
14. In one minute you can send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 50 times by saying Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam (May Allaah bless him and grant him peace). In return Allaah will send blessings upon you 500 hundred times because one blessing brings ten like it.
15. In one minute you can motivate your heart to give thanks to Allaah, to love Him, to fear Him, to put hope in Him, to long for Him, and thus travel through the stages of ‘uboodiyyah (total enslavement to Allaah). You could do this when you are lying on your bed or walking in the street.
16. In one minute you can read more than two pages of a useful book that is easy to understand.
17. In one minute you can uphold the ties of kinship by calling a relative on the phone.
18. You can raise your hands and recite any du’aa’ you wish from the books of du’aa’, in one minute.
19. You can say salaams to and shake hands with a number of people in one minute.
20. You can forbid an evil action in one minute.
21. You can enjoin something good in one minute.
22. You can offer sincere advice to a brother in one minute.
23. You can console someone who is depressed in one minute.
24. You can remove something harmful from the road in one minute.
25. Making the most of one minute motivates you to make the most of other periods that would otherwise be wasted.
 Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
 When people go to sleep, I let my tears flow, and I recite a verse of the most eloquent poetry
Is it not a waste that nights go by and I do not increase in knowledge, yet this time is counted as part of my life?
 Finally, the more sincere you are towards Allaah and the more aware you are of Him, the greater will be your reward and the more your hasanaat will increase.
Note that most of these actions will not cost you anything; they do not require tahaarah (purity) and they will not tire you out or take much effort. On the contrary, you can do them whilst you are walking, or in your car, or lying down, or standing, or sitting, or waiting for somebody. 
These actions are also among the greatest means of attaining happiness, expanding the chest (i.e., bringing relief and joy) and removing stress and anxiety. May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

1131,4160,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4160,"Ruling on images
      and designs on pieces of jewellery","Question

                What is the ruling on the following: 

1.                 Pieces of jewellery on which the Name of Allaah or names such as ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, ‘Abd-Allaah etc., are written? 

2.                 Pieces of jewellery on which signs of the zodiac (such as Aries, Scorpio, Libra, etc.) appear, whether they are imprinted or appear as a three-dimensional image that has a shadow? What is the ruling on praying wearing such items? 

3.                 Pieces of jewellery on which the picture of a head appears – without the body? 

4.                 Some pieces of gold which may be added to jewellery on which there is a picture of a man's profile, such as sovereigns bearing a profile of King George, etc. 

5.                 Stars of David (Jewish stars) or crosses, or any other symbols that are connected to the Jews and Christians? 

6.                 Gold rings that are designed specifically for men, which the shopkeepers say that they will not sell to Muslims?",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
      it is not permissible to engrave aayaat from the Qur’aan or the Name of
      Allaah on metals or stone, because this is not the purpose for which these
      aayaat were revealed, and because there is the fear that this would expose
      these aayaat and the Name of Allaah to disrespect.  
Secondly:
      using these signs of the zodiac is an idea that comes from jaahiliyyah and
      the Muslim is obliged to steer clear of this and of everything that could
      lead to a revival of these jaahili ideas. This is in addition to the fact
      that they involve pictures of animate beings. On this basis it is not
      permissible to make or collect jewellery that bears these images, or to
      pray wearing such items. 
Thirdly
      and fourthly: the ahaadeeth which forbid images of animate beings are
      general in meaning and include all images which are called images of
      living beings. This also includes images of the head, so on this basis it
      is not permissible to make these pieces. 
Selling
      and buying pictures of animate beings is not permitted, because it was
      reported that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
      be upon him) said:
“Allaah
      and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and
      idols.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 3/43; Muslim, 3/1207).
This
      prohibition exists also because it may lead to exaggerated ideas about
      those who are represented in the pictures, as happened in the case of the
      people of Nooh. In Saheeh al-Imaam al-Bukhaari, it is reported that
      concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And
      they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave
      Wadd, nor Suwaa‘, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya‘ooq nor Nasr’” [Nooh
      71:23],
      Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “These were the
      names of righteous people among the people of Nooh. When they died, the
      Shaytaan inspired their people to set up stone altars in the places where
      they used to sit, and these were named after them. So they did this, but
      they did not worship them. But when that generation died and knowledge was
      lost, the worship of these people began.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6/73). And
      there are many other texts which also forbid making and using images of
      living beings.
This
      applies to anything that is in the form of an animate creature. With
      regard to items on which there are pictures of animate beings, whether
      those items are made of gold, silver, paper, fabric or are tools, if they
      are circulated among people in order to be hung on walls etc. in a manner
      which is not considered disrespectful, then it is haraam to deal in them,
      because of the comprehensive nature of the evidence which states that
      making images is haraam. But if the item on which there is an image is to
      be used in a manner that implies disrespect, such as a tool used for
      cutting, a carpet that will be stepped on, a pillow that will be slept on,
      etc., then this is permissible, because of the report narrated in al-Saheehayn
      from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), in which she said
      that she hung up a curtain on which there were images, and the Messenger
      of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) tore it down.
      She said: I cut it up and made two pillows out of it, and he used to
      recline upon them. According to a version narrated by Ahmad: I cut it up
      and made two cushions out of it, and I saw him reclining on one of them
      and there was an image on it. (al-Bukhaari,6/103,
      214, 247; Muslim,3/1168-1169, no. 2107).
      We should note that making images of animate beings is haraam and such
      images should not be used in crafts, on clothing or in anything else,
      because of the evidence referred to above. 
Fifthly:
      it is not permissible to make jewellery that bears the symbols of kufr,
      such as crosses and stars of David. It is not permissible to buy or sell
      such items. 
Sixthly: it is not permissible to sell gold rings
      which are made specifically for men if they are going to wear them. The
      shopkeepers’ comments that they will not sell them to Muslims is no
      excuse, because they are in a Muslim country, and whoever lives in a
      Muslim country should not deal in anything except that which has been
      permitted by the pure sharee’ah of Islam. This argument is like the
      argument of the one who sells alcohol and says that he will only sell it
      to the kuffaar, because gold rings are haraam for men."

A couple of years back i went for the holy pilgrimage of hajj . at the time i performed the hajj wearing a nikab , it has come to my attention that its not permissable for women to cover their faces during the pilgrimage . when i did wear the nikab , i was informed by good sources that it was permissable .",,"Praise be to Allah.1 – Covering the face is something good for women. May Allah bestow abundant mercy on the women who cover their faces with niqaab. Perhaps your question is based on keenness for your religion – may Allah increase your keenness – but it is better to heed the commands of the religion, which tells women to remove the niqaab from their faces during prayer and Hajj, but especially during prayer, when it is not permissible to cover the face at all except if there are non-mahram men present. During Hajj it is permissible for women to lower the veil over their faces provided that it does not cling to their faces; this is what is called the burqa’. It is not permissible for the woman in ihram to wear it, but it is permissible for her to lower over her face a cover which comes down from her head over her face. If the burqa’ is not available, and there are men present who should not see the woman’s face, then it is permissible for her to wear the niqaab. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what kind of clothes do you command us to wear during ihram?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not wear a shirt or pants or a turban or a burnous. If one of you does not have any sandals then let him wear the khuffayn (leather slippers) and cut them so that they come below the ankle. Do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or turmeric. Women in ihram should not wear niqaab or gloves.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1468; Muslim, 1177). 
2 – With regard to lowering a cover over the face other than the niqaab, or for fear of being seen by non-mahram men, it has been reported in saheeh reports that some of the Sahaabiyyaat (women of the Sahaabah) did that: 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “We used to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when we were in ihram. If we met the riders we would lower our garments over our faces.
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
It is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman in ihram to cover her face; rather he forbade the niqaab only because it is worn on the face. He differentiated between the niqaab and covering the face. Based on this, if a woman in ihram covers her face, we say there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better for her to uncover it so long as there are no non-mahram men around her, in which case she should cover her face from them. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/153 
3 – With regard to the past and the Hajj that you did in the manner you describe, there is no sin on you because you were unaware. If a person does something that is not allowed during ihram because he was unaware or he forgot, there is no sin on him, and he does not have to offer any fidyah (ransom). 
It was narrated from Ya’la ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in al-Ji’raanah and entered ihram for ‘Umrah. The man had dyed his beard and hair with saffron, and he was wearing a jubbah (cloak). He said, “Take off your jubbah and wash off your saffron, and whatever you do in your Hajj, do in your ‘Umrah.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1697; Muslim, 1180). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Similar to forgetting are cases where one is unaware or is forced to do something, i.e., if a person forgets and puts on ordinary clothes when he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he has to take them off and put on the izaar and rida’ (ihram garments). The same applies to perfume; if he puts on perfume, forgetting that he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he must hasten to wash it off.

1134,4203,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4203,How many will enter Paradise?,"Question

In sahih bukhari, it is mentioned that ...70,000 of all mankind will enter paradise(!!!)
The first three generations of muslims alone probably amounts to 70,000.
Is there another explanation to this hadith?",,"Praise be to Allah.Perhaps you are referring to the hadith about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account, which was reported by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), Ahmad and others from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If you study this hadith and think about it, then in sha Allah the confusion you describe in your question will be resolved.
Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in his Saheeh from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown the nations, and some Prophets passed by with a few followers, and some Prophets passed by with no followers. Then I was shown a great multitude, and I said, ‘What is this? Is this my ummah?’ It was said, ‘No, this is Moosa and his people.’ It was said, ‘Look at the horizon.’ There I saw a huge multitude filling the horizon. And it was said, ‘Look there, and there, on the horizons of the sky.’ There was a multitude filling the horizons. It was said, ‘This is your ummah, and of these, seventy thousand will enter Paradise without being brought to account.’” Then he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] went inside, without explaining further. The people started to discuss what he had said, saying, “We are the ones who have believed in Allah and followed His Messenger; we are they” or, “It is our children who were born in Islam whilst we were born in Jaahiliyyah.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard about what was being said, so he came out and said: “They are the ones who do not seek ruqya, do not believe in bad omens and do not use cauterization; they put their trust in their Lord…”
What the hadith means is that there is a group of this ummah who will enter Paradise without being brought to account, not that the number of inhabitants of Paradise from this ummah is seventy thousand. The seventy thousand referred to in this hadith are of a high status in this ummah because of some special qualities that they have, as mentioned in the hadith: “They are the ones who do not seek ruqya, do not believe in bad omens and do not use cauterization; they put their trust in their Lord…”
The reason why they will enter Paradise without being brought to account and without being punished is stated clearly in another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) from Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I was shown the nations. One Prophet passed by with a group, another passed by with a small band, another with ten followers, another with five, and another on his own (with no followers). I looked and saw a huge multitude, and I said, “O Jibreel, are these my ummah?” He said “No, but look at the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge multitude. He said, “These are your ummah, and these are seventy thousand at their head who will not be brought to account or punished.” I said, “How come?” He said, “They do not use cauterization, or seek ruqya, or believe in bad omens; they put their trust in their Lord.”’ ‘Ukhaashah ibn Mihsan stood up and said, ‘Pray to Allah to make me one of them!’ He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said, ‘O Allaah, make him one of them.’ Then another man stood up and said, ‘Pray to Allah to make me one of them.’ He said, ‘ ‘Ukaashah has beaten you to it.’”
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 6059).
They are described further in another hadith, narrated by Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seventy thousand or seven hundred thousand [one of the narrators was not sure] of my ummah will enter Paradise, and the first of them will not enter until the last of them do so. And their faces will be like the moon on the night when it is full.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘A group of my ummah seventy thousand strong will enter Paradise, with their faces shining like the moon.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
Muslim also reported about them in his Saheeh from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah: “… then the believers will be saved and the first group to be saved will have faces like the moon when it is full, [they will be] seventy thousand, who will not be brought to account. Then will come those who shine like the stars in the sky…”
There is good news for all of us Muslims in this hadith and others. There is more information in a report narrated in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad and the Sunan of al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah, where Abu Umaamah is reported to have said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My Lord promised me that seventy thousand of my ummah will enter Paradise without being brought to account or being punished; with each thousand of them will be another seventy thousand, plus three handfuls of the handfuls of my Lord, may He be glorified.” We ask Allah to make us among them. Just imagine: seventy thousand, with each thousand of whom is another seventy thousand – how great will be the total number of people who will enter Paradise without being brought to account? How many will be in each handful “scooped up” by the Merciful, Compassionate, Generous Almighty Lord? We ask Allah to make us among that number.
The second item of good news is that the number of inhabitants of Paradise from this ummah will be two thirds of the total number. More people will enter Paradise from the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) than from all the previous nations combined. This good news comes from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hadith in which he said to his Companions one day, “Would you be pleased if you were a quarter of the people of Paradise?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “Would you be pleased if you were a third of the people of Paradise?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “Would you be pleased if you were a half of the people of Paradise?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise. No one will enter Paradise except a Muslim, and among the people of shirk you are like a white hair on the hide of a black bull, or a black hair on the hide of a red bull.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6047). The final part of the good news comes in another saheeh hadith, in which he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise are 120 rows, of which eighty are from this ummah and the other forty from all the other nations.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3469; he said this is a hasan hadith). We praise Allah for His blessings and ask Him for His grace and mercy, and to make us dwell in Paradise by His mercy and kindness. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

    men. In fact, they are general for both men and women. If a young woman grows up in the
    worship of Allah, she is included among them. Similarly, two women who love each other for
    the sake of Allah alone are also included. Again, any woman who is invited to illegal
    sexual intercourse by a man of nobility and beauty and she refuses his advances, saying,
    ""I fear Allah,"" will be one of those in the shade of Allah.
Any woman who gives in charity from her legal earnings to the extent that
    her left hand does not know what her right hand has given will be included among them. If
    a woman remembers Allah when she is alone by herself, she will be included among them like

Even on the secondary school level on the agenda of Curriculum, we do not have books that deal with the branches of knowledge that are available in secular institutes, such as; Political science, Sociology, Psychology, Pedagogy. Please advise on how we should go about bringing about an Islamic Education system for our Youth in the west (bearing in mind that it is near impossible for us to migrate to Arab/Muslim countries because of the restrictions on immigration etc.)",,"Praise be to Allah.In order to preserve the structure of the Muslim family in the non-Muslim countries, we need to meet a number of conditions and requirements, both within the home and outside it:


Within the home:




It is essential for parents to uphold the habit of praying regularly in the mosque with their children; if there is no mosque nearby, then they must pray in jamaa’ah (congregation) at home.


They have to read Qur’aan and listen to its recitation daily.


They must eat meals together.


They must speak in the language of the Qur’aan as much as they can.


They must uphold the good manners prescribed by the Lord of the Worlds for families and in social settings; these include those that are to be found in Soorat al-Noor.


They should not let themselves or their children watch immoral and corrupt movies and shows.


Their children have to sleep at home and should stay home as much as possible, to protect them from the influences of the bad environment outside. They should be very strict in not allowing their children to sleep outside the home (“sleepovers”).


They should avoid sending their children to universities far from home where they would have to stay in university accommodation, otherwise we will lose our children, who will be assimilated into the non-Muslim society.


We have to be careful to eat only halaal (lawful)food and the parents must avoid using all kinds of haraam (unlawful) things such as cigarettes, marijuana and other things which are widely available in non-Muslim countries.




Outside the home:




We must send our children to Islamic schools from kindergarten to the end of secondary school (high school).


We must also send them to the mosque as much as possible, to pray Jumu’ah (Friday prayers) and other prayers in jamaa’ah, and to attend lectures, halaqahs (study circles) and study circles, etc.


We must establish educational and sporting activities for children and youth in places that are supervised by Muslims.


Organizing educational camps where all members of the family can go.


Fathers and mothers should strive to go to the Holy Places to perform the rituals of ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage)and the obligation of Hajj (pilgrimage), accompanied by their children.


Training children to speak about Islam in simple language which adults and children, Muslim and non-Muslim, can understand.


Training children to memorize Qur’aan and sending some of them – if possible – to a Muslim Arab country so that they can gain an understanding of the religion, then come back to be daa’iyahs (inviters)who are equipped with knowledge of Islam and the language of the Qur’aan.


Training some of our sons to give Jumu’ah Khutbahs (Fridat sermons), and to lead the Muslims in prayer, so that they will become leaders of the Muslim community.


Encouraging children to marry early so as to protect their religious and worldly interests.


We have to encourage them to marry Muslim girls from families who are known for their religious commitment and good attitudes.
We have to avoid using the number 911 and calling the police to come to the house to resolve conflicts. If conflicts arise, we must get in touch with a responsible member of the Muslim community or with wise Muslims to help resolve the conflict.
Not attending parties where there is dancing, music and singing, or joining in celebrations of immorality or the festivals of kufr; stopping our children, with wisdom, from going to church on Sundays with Christian students.

1142,4259,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4259,What is the ruling on playing karate,"Question

                What is the ruling on playing karate?",,"Praise be to Allah.Karate is one of the martial 
          arts, a form of self-defence using one’s hands, without any kind of 
          weapon. It allows hitting with the foot, fist or edge of the hand, focusing 
          on concentrating all one's energy in that blow. 
 The shar’i viewpoint 
          of this sport: 
 The sport includes numerous 
          physical, psychological and mental benefits, and it is in accordance 
          with sharee’ah in some ways, and goes against it in others. Among the 
          ways in which it is in accordance with Islam are: 
The concealing garments which cover all 
          the ‘awrah completely. The rules of this sport require wearing covering 
          garments composed of a shirt of thick white cotton, and trousers made 
          of the same material, which have to be wide to allow movement of the 
          legs and feet. 
 Combatants are forbidden 
          to direct blows that will cause harm to their opponents. The rules of 
          the game dictate that attacks must be restrained, and must not cause 
          harm to one's opponent, unlike the rules of boxing, for example. 
 But on the other hand 
          this sport is not free of things that go against sharee’ah, such as 
          allowing blows to the face. 
 In addition, it includes 
          some religious rituals that are derived from local Indian religions, 
          such as the exchange of greetings between the combatants, which take 
          the form of bows that are similar to rukoo’ (the Muslim does not bow 
          to anyone except Allaah), and the exercises such as keeping silent and 
          focusing or meditating, which are derived from the religious rituals 
          of Buddhism, etc. All of these are totally rejected by Islam. 
 But it is not forbidden to practise 
          this sport once these issues have been eliminated. It is possible to 
          eliminate them on an unofficial level, even if it is not possible to 
          do so on an official and international level.  It is not essential 
          to learn these skills at the level of championships and clubs which 
          adhere to these matters and view them as an essential part of the sport 
          which everyone who practises it must adhere to."

Riba is forbidden because of the harmful effects that result from it,

    Economic effects, e.g., keeping money idle and unproductive, and swelling the ranks of the
    poor;
    Social effects, e.g., cutting ties, creating enmity and hatred between the poor and the
    rich, and spreading corruption and promiscuity caused by need;
    Psychological and spiritual effects, e.g., arrogance, looking down on others,
    hard-heartedness and exploiting the needs of the poor.
    The above describes the effects of Riba on the individual level. On the state level,
    countries are weakened, their resources fall under the control of others, they end up
    following their enemies’ desires, they are robbed of their natural wealth and their
    problems get even worse. This is what we see happening in reality. We ask Allaah to keep

    fathers wealth except with his consent.
From Ibn Jurayj, who said:  Ataa did not see anything
    wrong with a man taking whatever he wanted of his son's wealth, even if it was not a case
    of necessity.
Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on him):
Those who say: a man should not take anything of his son's
    wealth except with his permission.
From Ibn Seereen, who said: A son should honour his father, but
    each man has more right to that which he himself owns.
Saalim reported that Hamzah ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Umar
    sacrificed a camel, then a beggar came to Ibn Umar [i.e., Abd-Allaah, the
    father of the one who offered the sacrifice]. Abd-Allaah said, Its not
    mine [i.e., the meat of the sacrifice isnt mine to give away]. Hamzah said:
    O my father, you have my permission, so give away whatever you want of it.
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni,
    commenting on this matter:
Any father has the right to take whatever he wants of his son's
    wealth and to take possession of it, whether the father needs it or not, and whether the
    son is an adult or a child, provided two conditions are met. The first is that this should
    not be unfair to the son or cause him any harm, and that the father should not take
    anything that the son needs. The second is that he should not take from the wealth of one
    child to give it to another child. This is what was stated by Ahmad This is because
    it is prohibited for a father to show favouritism in giving to one child from his own
    wealth, so the prohibition should apply even more to the case of a father taking from one
    child to give to another. 
Abu Haneefah, Maalik and al-Shaafa'i said:
He does not have the right to take any more from his son's wealth than
    what he needs, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Your blood and your wealth are as sacred to you as this day of yours in this month
    of yours. (Agreed upon). It was reported that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It is not permissible to take the
    wealth of a Muslim except with his consent. (Reported by al-Daaraqutni). The son has full ownership of his wealth, and it should not be taken away from
    him, as the case if he needs it . Our evidence for this is the report of
    Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The best of what you
    consume is what you earn, and your children are part of what you earn. (Reported
    by Saeed and al-Tirmidhi, who said: a hasan hadeeth). Amr ibn
    Shuayb reported, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: A man came
    to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, My father
    needed all my wealth. He said, You and your wealth belong to your
    father. A longer version was reported by al-Tabaraani in al-Mujam,
    and by others, which adds: Your children are among the best of your earnings, so
    consume whatever they have of wealth. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir and al-Mutlib ibn
    Hantab reported: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) and said: I have wealth and children, and my father has wealth
    and children, but my father wants to take my wealth. The Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: You and your wealth belong to your
    father. (Reported by Saeed in his Sunan).
    Also, Allaah has described the child as a gift to his father, as He says (interpretation
    of the meanings):
    And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq, and (a grandson)
    Yaqoob [al-Anbiya 21:72]
 and We bestowed upon him Yahyaa
    [al-Anbiya 21:90]
[Zakariya said:] So give me from Yourself an
    heir. [Maryam 19:5]
[Ibraaheem said]: All praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who
    has given me in old age Ismaaeel and Ishaaq [Ibraaheem 14:39]
Whoever is given to a person as a gift, he is allowed to take his
    wealth, just as he has the right to take the wealth of his slave. (al-Mughni, part
    5).
In the dissertations and fatwas of the Mufti Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Ibraaheem ibn Abd al-Lateef Aal al-Shaykh, it says the following:
A father is permitted to take from his sons wealth, because of
    the sayings of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): You and
    your wealth belong to your father (reported by the five and classed as saheeh
    by al-Tirmidhi) and The best of what you consume is what you earn,
    and your children are part of your earnings (reported by al-Tirmidhi,
    al-Nisaa'i and Ibn Maajah from Aaishah). The fathers
    taking from his son's earnings is subject to six conditions:
    He should not take what his child needs or the loss of which would cause
        harm to his child.

He should not give it to another of his children.

He should not take anything when either of them is on his deathbed.

The father should not be a kaafir when the son is a Muslim.

The wealth should exist in a tangible form.

Whatever the father takes from his son becomes his when he takes it with the appropriate
        intention or a spoken statement. 
This is the gist of what our fuqaha (may Allaah have mercy on
    them) have said, and this is our fatwa."

                My daughter just turned 40 days old and I went to the mosque to do the traditional sajdah which is done in my home country of Pakistan.  The Imam there however refused to do it because it is not in any Hadeeth.  He also said that the prophet (pbuh) didn't do it and we shouldn't try to be better than him.",,"Praise be to Allah.This prostration, as the imaam of the mosque 
          said, has no basis (in Islam). Yes, there is sujood al-shukr (prostration 
          of thanksgiving) which is prescribed when a new blessing comes or something 
          bad is warded off, but this is no longer applicable when such a long 
          time has passed. 
 - 
          Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr. 
 If 
          you had done the prostration of thanksgiving when your daughter was 
          born safe and sound and her mother was fine, we would say that this 
          is good, and is an action prescribed by Islam. But allocating a specific 
          time of forty days, and saying that it has to be done in the mosque, 
          is bid’ah. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good."
1148,4309,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4309,It      is not permissible to show any kind of disrespect towards graves,"Question

In our village the graves have been subjected to disrespect. The graveyard has become a pathway for camels, cattle and goats, and a route for cars. Even worse than that, some people have applied to build on the graves. What is your view about this matter?",,"Praise be to Allah.This is not permissible, because it is not permissible to interfere with graves in any way so long as any remains of the dead are still to be found in them. The sanctity of the dead is like the sanctity of the living. So it is not permissible to subject graves to any disrespect, whether by stepping on them, making them pathways, praying in the graveyard, or making them part of people’s dwelling-places. None of these things are allowed, unless the occupants of the graves have turned to dust and there is nothing left of their bodies. In that case, it is OK to use the graveyards for fields or houses or other purposes. But so long as any trace of the dead bodies are left, it is not permissible to use them or walk on them, because the dead Muslim came to this place before you; he got there first so he has more right to it. His sanctity when he is dead is the same as his sanctity when he was alive. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man step on a grave, he said: “If one of you were to sit on a live coal that burned his garment and reached his skin, that would be better for him than sitting on a grave.” (Narrated by Muslim, 9711; Abu Dawood, 3228). This is a warning, because of the disrespect towards that Muslim that is involved. The scholars stated that it is haraam to relieve oneself in between graves, and that it is not permitted to sit on a grave, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not sit on graves, and do not pray towards them.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 972; Abu Dawood, no. 3229). We should not lean on graves, or step on them, or show any disrespect towards them; all of that is not allowed. And Allah is the Source of strength."
1149,4318,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4318,"Her husband did
    not respect her family and divorced her after the nikaah but before the wedding party","Question

                I have a two part question.
      First of all, I recently divorced from my husband. There were many reasons but the main
      reason was that he disrespected my mother and father by talking to them very harshly not
      once but several times. I figured if he could not respect my parents how could he possibly
      respect me? I love my parents very much and I don't like to see them hurt. My question is
      what is a husband's role in Islam in repect to his wife . Isn't he suppose to respect her
      family also? Once a woman gets married does it mean that the husband is first priority and
      that her parents come in second? 
      Secondly, I only had the Nikkah done, the rukhsati was going to be in April but I still
      lost my virginity. Now I fear my ex-husband will tell this in court which will be a cause
      of extreme embarassment for me in front of my parents especially my father. According to
      Islam, is it wrong to lose one's virginity before rukhsati?",,"Praise be to Allah.The parents have great rights, but the husband has a
    greater right. It is not permissible for either party to abuse the rights of the other. If
    the wife thinks that her husband has wronged her parents, she should advise him and remind
    him that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning),  and live with them
    [wives] honourably [al-Nisa 4:19] includes treating her family well
    too, because that makes her happy, and it includes not harming them, because that upsets
    her. By the same token, if one or both of her parents abuse her husbands rights, she
    should advise them and remind them of the seriousness of backbiting, wrongdoing and
    aggression. If they order her to do something and her husband orders her to do the
    opposite, then her husband takes precedence, because his rights are greater in
    shareeah. This does not mean that she should forget about their rights; this is the
    guideline she should follow in cases where there is a conflict.
With regard to your second question, it is not haraam according to
    shareeah for a man to have intercourse with his wife after the nikaah (conclusion of
    the marriage contract) and before the wedding party. Whatever happened after the nikaah is
    halaal (permissible), so there is no scandal involved and no need to fear the
    consequences. If a man divorces his wife after the marriage has been consummated, then she
    is entitled to keep the entire mahr (dowry)
If it is possible for mediators to try to bring you back together in
    accordance with shareeah and following the proper etiquette, then this is better.
    And Allaah is the source of strength."
1150,4319,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4319,A Jewish Woman Thinking About Embracing Islam,"Question

I have very difficult question and I think this is my only hope that you can help me to find the answer.
I am a Russian Jewish girl and I know this Muslim guy for over a year. The longer we know each other, the more problems and difficulties we face. Not in the religious or cultural ways. We love each other and there is an issue of whether he can marry me or not.
He is a very good Muslim and he comes from traditional family. I am very fond of his beliefs and beliefs of his family. I was born in a very agnostic country and couldn't be properly introduced into any religion. It was forbidden. When I came to the US I started my research on different religions and found out that my beliefs do not really match all Jewish sayings. I did a lot of research on Islam and by looking at him and a couple other Muslim boys and girls, and by reading Quaran, I have a very strong feeling that I could become a good Muslim. I want to go to school to learn the culture and religion more precisely, to learn the language. I contacted the mosque and was ready to go... but I faced the issue: would I be accepted as a Muslim sister like other people who came from different religions except Jewish? Jews and Muslims are in big contradictions and I know that friendship is almost impossible. I am praying to God (in my home language - Russian), to lead me the right way to achieve my beliefs.
Please, help me to find my answers!",,"Praise be to Allah.“I have a very strong feeling that I could become a good Muslim.” The way you express yourself so clearly in your message indicates that you are indeed open to the truth and have been sincerely seeking for it.
“I am praying to God (in my home language –Russian), to lead me to the right way…” What you say here, at the end of your message, makes the Muslim reader feel deeply moved by the story of a woman who has turned towards Allah after realizing that He answers the prayers of those who call on Him and ask for guidance to the right way. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them, by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186]. It is a good sign that your heart appears to be open to Islam. Allah also tells us in the Quran: “And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky…” [al-An’aam 6:125]
Please note that Muslims who understand their religion properly will not feel any kind of reservation or resentment towards any brother or sister who embraces Islam, no matter what their origins. The fact that a new Muslim comes from a Jewish or Christian background should not be a reason for any kind of discrimination or prejudice. We will give you two examples from Islamic history of two Jews – one man and one woman – who entered Islam.
The first one is Abu Yoosuf ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam (may Allah be pleased with him). Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had come to Madeenah, he came to him and said, ‘I am going to ask you about three things which no one knows except a Prophet. What is the first Sign of the Hour? What is the first food that the people of Paradise will eat? And how is it that a child may resemble either his father or his maternal uncles?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Jibreel has just now informed me about these.’ ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam said, ‘He is the enemy of the Jews among the angels.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The first sign of the Hour is a fire that will gather the people together from the East to the West. The first food that the people of Paradise will eat will be the caudate (extra) lobe of fish-liver. As for the child resembling one parent or another, when a man has intercourse with his wife, if the man’s discharge precedes the woman’s discharge, the child will resemble the man, and if the woman’s discharge precedes the man’s, the child will resemble the woman.” [‘Abd-Allah] said: ‘I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah…’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3082).
Al-Bukhari also reported: “ ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam came and said: ‘I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah and that you have brought the truth. The Jews know that I am the best of them and the son of the best of them, and I am the most knowledgeable of them and the son of the most knowledgeable of them, so call them and ask them about me before they know that I have become Muslim, for if they know that I have become Muslim, they will say things about me that are not true.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent for them and they came to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to them, ‘O Jews, woe to you! Fear Allah, for by Allah besides Whom there is no other god, you know that I am truly the Messenger of Allah and that I come to you with the truth, so become Muslim.’ They said, ‘We know nothing about that.’ He said it three times… He said, ‘What kind of man is ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam among you?’ They said, ‘He is the best of us and the son of the best of us; he is the most knowledgeable of us and the son of the most knowledgeable among us.’ He said, ‘What would you think if he became Muslim?’ They said, ‘May Allah protect him from that! He would never become Muslim.’ He said, ‘What would you think if he became Muslim?’ They said, ‘May Allah protect him from that! He would never become Muslim.’ He said, ‘What would you think if he became Muslim?’ They said, ‘May Allah protect him from that! He would never become Muslim.’ He said, ‘O son of Salaam, come out to them.’ He [‘Abd-Allah] came out and said, ‘O Jews, fear Allah! By Allah besides Whom there is no other god, you know that he is the Messenger of Allah and that he has come with the truth.’ They said, ‘You are lying!’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them to leave.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3621)
This man’s Jewish origins did not prevent him from being one of those who were given the glad tidings of Paradise before they died. Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I never heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying to any man who walked on the face of the earth that he would be one of the people of Paradise except for ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam. Concerning him, the aayah - verse (interpretation of the meaning) ‘… and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies that this Quran is from Allah…’ [al-Ahqaaf 46:10] was revealed.”
The Jewish woman who became Muslim was Safiyyah bint Huyay ibn Akhtab, from the Jews of Khaybar, who believed in Allah as her Lord, Islam as her religion, and Muhammad as her Prophet.
This Jewish woman Safiyyah, who embraced Islam, became a mother for all of us Muslims, as Allah said in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers…” [al-Ahzaab 33:6].
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed between Khaybar and Madeenah for three days when he got married to Safiyyah bint Huyay, and invited the Muslims to his waleemah (wedding feast)… The Muslims said, ‘Is she one of the Mothers of the Believers or is she one of those whom his right hand possesses?’ They said, ‘If he covers her, then she is one of the Mothers of the Believers and if he does not cover her, then she is one of those whom his right hand possesses.’ When he got on his camel, he made her ride behind him, and he put a screen between her and the people.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4762).
Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) was the one for whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out of seclusion (I’tikaaf) especially to accompany her to her house. (The one who is in seclusion for worship is not allowed to come out except for a valid reason). ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that Safiyyah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him that she came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to visit him whilst he was in I’tikaaf (seclusion) in the mosque, during the last ten days of Ramadaan. She spoke with him for a while, then she wanted to go back to her house, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up and took her back… (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1894)
According to another report: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in the mosque, and his wives were with him, then they left. He said to Safiyyah bint Huyay, “Don’t rush, I will go with you.” Her home was in the house of Usaamah, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out with her … (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1897). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to take care of her and show compassion towards her. Anas ibn  Maalik, the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described how he took care of his wife Safiyyah on a journey: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spreading his cloak for her to sit on it, then kneeling down and putting his knee for her to step on in order to get onto the camel.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2081). 
These examples and others make it clear that the new Muslim has his or her rightful place in Islam, regardless of whether his background is Jewish or anything else. If some Muslims reject a Jewish man or woman who has become Muslim, this is because of their ignorance and shortcomings; as far as the Islamic view is concerned, you know what it is [Islam welcomes all newcomers]. So hasten to enter Islam at once, and we are sure that you will be happy with your new life in this religion. 
It only remains for us to comment on one other matter you mention in your question, which is your relationship with the Muslim man you refer to. This relationship will not be acceptable to Allah unless it is on the basis of marriage, which Allah has prescribed for His slaves, and which He accepts as the way for men and women to have relationships. We imagine that in your case, as you describe it, your becoming Muslim and repenting will open the doors and pave the way for you to have a proper relationship (i.e., marriage) with this Muslim man. 
We ask Allah to guide you to the truth and help you adhere to it, to give you goodness in this world and grant you the victory of Paradise in the Hereafter.
Allah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

                If today there is a jew or a christian who believes in Alaah and that he has no partner. He believes in the prophethood of the Messenger of Allaah . But he does not rule by the Qur'aan even though he accepts it as being from Allaah, but he deems it permissible to rule by the original torah. Is he a muslim. 
This needs a quick response if you can , for dawah purposes. 
Jazak Allaahu Khair.",,"Praise be to Allah.We sent this question to our
      Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak, who replied as follows:
Among
      the basic principles of faith are Belief in all the Books that have been
      revealed from Allaah, and belief in all the Messengers. These two
      principles include belief in the noblest of Books, which is the Qur’aan,
      and the best of the Messengers, namely Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings
      of Allaah be upon him), the Seal of the Messengers and the Messenger of
      Allaah to all of mankind from the time when Allaah sent him until the time
      when the Hour will begin. Every person from every nation must believe in
      him and follow him and rule by his sharee’ah (laws). Whoever claims to
      believe in him and in the Qur’aan, but does not rule according to it or
      follow him in everything that he brought and believe everything he told
      us, is not a Muslim or a believer. If he dies like this then he will be
      one of the people of Hell. If he claims to believe in Allaah Alone, with
      no partner or associate, and in all the Messengers, belief in the
      Messenger and in the Qur’aan does not only mean believing that they are
      true, without following them and ruling according to what they say. Many
      of the Mushrikeen believed in the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) in their hearts, and there were those who
      believed in him in their hearts and in the words they spoke, but this did
      not benefit them at all, like his uncle Abu Taalib. This belief did not
      help them at all when they insisted on not following. Similarly, the Jews
      and Christians who knew himas
      they knew their sons, and who admitted that they believed in the Messenger
      
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but this knowledge and
      belief did not benefit them at all when they refused to follow him. They
      were kaafirs and Allaah decreed their blood and their wealth to be
      permissible for His Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him), so he fought them, and Allaah caused him to prevail over them, and
      His religion to prevail over all other religions. Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is He Who has sent His
      Messenger (Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) with
      guidance and the religion of truth (islam), to make it superior over all
      religions, even though the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters,
      disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah) hate (it).” [al-Tawbah 9:33]
So
      every Jew and Christian has to enter the religion of Islam which Allaah
      revealed to His Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
      upon him), because the Message of Muhammad is the final Message, which
      abrogates the previous religions. Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“And whoever seeks a
      religion other than islam, it will never be accepted of him” [Aal
      ‘Imraan 3:85]
According
      to a saheeh hadeeth: “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad,
      there is no one among this ummah, Jew or Christian, who hears of me than
      dies without believing in that with which I have been sent, but he will be
      one of the people of Hellfire.” (Reported by Muslim, 218).
On
      this basis, the religion of any Jew or Christian will not be correct
      unless he believes in the sharee’ah of Islam and adheres to the rulings
      of the Holy Qur’aan. The Qur’aan is Muhaymin (i.e., it
      testifies to the truth that is in the previous scriptures and exposes the
      falsehood that has been added to them), and it abrogates the previous
      Books. The Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel) have been abrogated and
      have been changed and altered. And Allaah knows best."
1152,4329,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4329,Accusing a Muslim of drinking    wine,"Question

                What is the ruling on someone (muslim) saying lies about his other brother.i.e saying he drinks Alcohol and other sort of things.",,"Praise be to Allah.Accusing a Muslim of doing an evil deed without proof is a major sin which deserves punishment. Talking about it to other people is a kind of gheebah (backbiting, gossip) which Allaah has forbidden and likened to a person eating the flesh of his dead brother, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.”[al-Hujuraat 49:12]
“Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter…” [al-Noor 24:19].
Whoever slanders his brother or accuses him of an evil deed has to repent to Allaah, ask his brother’s forgiveness, and avoid everything that causes harm to a fellow Muslim. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him say something good or else remain silent.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/256, and by Muslim, no. 47). Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘No man accuses another of an immoral deed or kufr, but it will come back on him, if the person he accuses is not as he says he is.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 10/388). Accusing a Muslim of drinking wine is the same as accusing him of an immoral deed (fisq), and whoever accuses his brother of something he is not guilty of, Allaah will make him fall into the thing he of which he accused his brother. A man was brought to ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, and he was told, “This is so and so, his beard was dripping with wine.” [Ibn ‘Abbaas] said, “We were forbidden to spy on others, but if something is obvious to us, we will accept it and act accordingly.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 4890, who said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth).
It is not permissible for the Muslim to spy on his Muslim brother or to seek out his faults. If he accidentally sees him in a doubtful place or seeming to behave in a doubtful manner, he should not accuse him unless he sees him with his own eyes doing a wrongful action. He should advise and counsel him, then if he insists on doing that thing, and there is fear that he may harm other Muslims, or if one is asked about him for a legitimate reason, then he should tell those who have something to do with it about what he knows. But he should not broadcast it unless the person does the evil action openly, because this will only help the Shaytaan against him and stop him from repenting. And Allaah knows best."

      respect for any-one even her husband and I live with them - can I say something to her to
      change her attitude . If she refuses, what shall I do? Do I give her Slam. Jazaka Allah
      Khira.",,"Praise be to Allah.A kind word opens the doors to people’s hearts and
    removes enmity from them, and tolerance, forgiveness and sincerity restore love between
    people. When a person speaks a kind word and turns a blind eye to bad treatment, he earns
    people’s respect and makes the one who has done something bad apologize for his bad
    behaviour or stop persisting in it. Undoubtedly some people may choose a way of dealing
    with people that they themselves would not like to be dealt with, and they think that
    being tough and confrontational is what will make people respect them. When a person
    insists on persisting in sin, and faces harsh criticism, he finds himself lost in a
    vicious circle of hatred and revenge, so he can no longer tell right from wrong or true
    from false. So nobody can advise him, because whatever is said is taken as the opening of
    a confrontation or a continuation of enmity, and he is always watching and waiting for
    trouble. It is safer in this case to think about how we are going to deal with such a
    person, so we leave him alone for a while, trying to calm his fears of criticism and being
    called to account. We use some kind words, gentleness and smiles to make him feel that we
    forgive him and care about him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e., Allaah
    ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who
    treat them badly), then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as
    though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality), except those who
    are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in
    the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise, and in this world of a high moral
    character).”[Fussilat 41:35]
Leaving the person alone does not mean cutting all ties and
    refraining from returning greetings or talking to him; what it does mean is avoiding
    mixing with him so that we give him the opportunity to prepare himself to accept advice.
    Then we can start by mentioning his good points and saying what good things we wish for
    him and the hopes we have for him. Then we can give him advice (naseehah) in an
    appropriate manner, without hurting his feelings, offending him or boring him. We should
    do this in the hope of earning reward from Allaah, and with patience and tolerance. From
    our behaviour and good treatment we should set an example to the one whom we wish to
    advise. We should listen to the direction given by Allaah to His Messenger (interpretation
    of the meaning):
“Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the
    foolish (i.e., don’t punish them).”[al-A’raaf 7:199]
Rushing to condemn and criticize without looking for the
    appropriate moment usually leads to the opposite of the desired results. Humility and a
    gentle approach lifts barriers and removes aggression and hostility. According to a saheeh
    hadeeth narrated by ‘Ayaad (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has revealed to me that you
    should be so humble that no one oppresses another or boasts to another.” (Reported
    by Muslim, 2865)."

I am going to work in offshore oil company where I will be staying for 14days and then I will be getting a leave of 14days and it is around 1000km from my native place so can you please tell me how many rakats I should perform for my each prayer ?",,"Praise be to Allah.The distance of travel which allows one to shorten prayers is considered to be the distance covered by two days and two nights travel, which is 48 Haashimi miles. This is the opinion of al-Shaafa’i, Maalik and Ahmad
(Bidaayah al-Mujtahid, 1/162; al-Majmoo’, 4/213; al-Mughni, 2/255). Their evidence for this was the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbas, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people of Makkah, do not shorten your prayers for a distance less than four birad from Makkah to ‘Asfaan.” (Reported by al-Daaraqutni,3/139). Some of the scholars have calculated this in current measurements as being equivalent to approximately eighty kilometers.
The length of time one is travelling
The Shaafa’is and Maalikis said: if he intends to stay for four days, he should do the prayers in full, because Allah allowed us to shorten the prayers provided that one is moving and travelling.
They used as evidence the report narrated by al-‘Ala’ ibn al-Hadrami that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The non-resident should stay in Makkah for three days after completing the rites of Hajj.”
(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 1/341).
The Hanbalis said that if he intends to stay more than four days he should do the prayers in full. They used as evidence the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Makkah on the morning of the fourth of Dhoo’l-Hijjah, and stayed there on the fourth, fifth and sixth, and prayed Subh (Fajr) on the eighth day. then he went out to Mina, and he used to shorten his prayers.
It is better for you to do your prayers in full when you are at work, because you will be staying there for more than twenty fard prayers, meaning more than four days, and most of the four Imaams said that the person who wants to stay in a place for this length of time should do the prayers in full. To be on the safe side and to avoid being subject to any blame, it is better to do the prayers in full. With regard to the time when you are actually travelling, by land or sea or air, for the distance mentioned in the question, then you know that the Sunnah is to shorten your prayers.

                , over about the last two years I have found my dreams frequently coming true. Once In my dream I was looking at the first few words of surah 3, verse 17 which I didn't know of before and only recognized once I bought a copy of The Noble Qur'an and remembered how I had seen a few long words in one line, all spaced out.
I even distinctly remember seeing the word 'walmunfiqeen' which at the time of my dream,I thought said 'munaafiqeena',subhaan Allah. At another time, I saw myself going up a kind of ramp at the beginning of which was an arrow marked 'prophets'. It led me to an interior where I felt the bodies of prophets were kept and I felt a bit scared.
What came to my mind then was that 25 prophets are mentioned in the Qur'an. And there are other dreams which I cannot all talk about now. But recently I have been seeing myself in my dreams looking at Islamic books in shops and unknown places and asking about books of Hadith.
I feel that I should be doing something for Islaam and showing my gratitude to Allah. Please advise me on what I might have to do and how might be the best way of going about it. At the moment, I am in my final year at university. Your reply is eagerly awaited.
Jazak-Allah Khair,",,"Praise be to Allah.It is obvious that your dreams illustrate a strong desire to acquire the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah. It is with no doubt, the best thing a Muslim could spend his time, money and effort pursuing. A Muslim who acquires this knowledge not only benefits himself; he benefits others as well. Our Prophet salla Allah alaihi wasallam told us that Acquiring the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah is a must on every Muslim and that the Angles are so pleased with the Muslim who pursues this knowledge, they put their wings down for him. This indicates how important this issue is. Yet you should make sure that your intention in learning is solely for Allah, and not to show of or to attract attention. Your recall of the word Almunafiqeen, which means the hypocrites, might be a warning sign that you must correct your intention in all acts. Remember that Allah accepts only the deeds that are entirely done for Him alone.
Being a good learned Muslim who learns and teaches Islam to others is one of the best ways of showing your gratitude towards Allah, and Allah knows best.

      again--this time his parents would know about it. So is it possible to have 2 nikaah
      ceremonies or is this not allowed?",,"Praise be to Allah.In principle, the wedding party and waleemah should be
    done at the time when the groom enters upon his bride, because one of the aims of the
    waleemah is to publicize the marriage, as it is something legitimate that should be made
    known, as opposed to fornication which is done in secret and is hidden – even though
    nowadays some people have no shame and commit haraam deeds openly, seeing no difference
    between halaal and haraam (we ask Allaah to keep us safe from that). “They are
    like cattle, nay, even more astray” [al-A’raaf 7:179 – interpretation of
    the meaning]. There is nothing wrong with having a second wedding party, even after
    some time has passed, if there is a reason for doing so. Perhaps the person who is asking
    this question wants to please his parents and not make them angry. He could just inform
    his parents, without having a wedding party, or he could invite them for a meal without

                With regard to Islam, what is the soul? For
      instance, who created the soul, and what limitations does it have?",,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah is the Creator of all things, and the soul is
    something that has been created just like everything else. The knowledge about its true
    essence is something that belongs exclusively to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.
    Allaah has kept this knowledge exclusively to Himself, as is stated in the hadeeth of
    Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: Whilst
    I was with the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a farm, and he was
    resting on a palm branch stripped of its leaves, the Jews passed by, and some of them said
    to others, Ask him about the soul. Some of them said, What urges you to
    ask him about it? Others of them said, Dont ask him in case he says
    something you dislike. But they said, Ask him, so they asked him about
    the soul. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept quiet and did not
    respond to them, and I knew that he was receiving Revelation, so I stayed where I was.
    When the Revelation of the aayah was complete, he said (interpretation of the meaning): And
    they ask you [O Muhammad] concerning the rooh [the spirit]. Say: The rooh: it is one
    of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you
    (mankind) have been given only a little. [al-Isra 17:85] (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari). The rooh (soul or spirit) has been described by
    Allaah in His Book and by the Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in
    his Sunnah, and various verbs and adjectives have been used in conjunction with the word
    rooh, such as seizing or grasping, taking (as in death), it may be
    fettered or shrouded, it comes and goes, it goes up and comes down, it may be pulled out
    like a hair being pulled out of dough It is obligatory (in Islam) to believe in
    these attributes which are narrated in the two Revelations (i.e., the
    Quraan and Sunnah), and also to realize that the soul is not like the body.
    Allaah created Adam and breathed the soul into him, as is stated in the
    Quraan and in the hadeeth of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him): When Allaah created Adam and breathed the soul into him, he sneezed and said
    Al-hamdu-Lillah (Praise be to Allaah). He praised Allaah by His
    permission. Then his Lord said to him, May Allaah have mercy on you, O Adam. Go to
    those angels, to a group of them who are sitting, and say, As-salaamu
    alaykum (peace be upon you). They said, Wa alayka al-salaam
    wa rahmat-Allaah (and upon you be peace and the Mercy of Allaah). Then he went
    back to his Lord, who said, This is your greeting and the greeting of your
    descendants amongst themselves. (Reported and classed as hasan by
    al-Tirmidhi. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 3290).
    Allaah sends the angel to breathe the soul into the
    foetus as was reported by Abd-Allaah ibn Masood, who said: The Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the most truthful (of human
    beings) and his being truthful (is a fact) told us: The constituents of one of you
    is gathered in his mothers womb for forty days, then it becomes a clot of blood
    within another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh, and forty days
    later, Allaah sends His angel to it to breathe into it the soul. The angel comes with
    instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death,
    his deeds and whether he will doomed or blessed. (Reported by Muslim, 1528).
    The soul of the deceased is taken from the ends of the
    toes towards the top of the body, and when it reaches the throat, the death rattle sounds
    in the throat of the person who is about to die, and his eyes glaze over and roll upwards.
    Um Salamah said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) entered upon Abu Salamah (after he had died) and his eyes were open, so he closed
    them then said, When the soul is taken, the eyes follow it. (Reported
    by Muslim, 1528).
    The soul is met by the angels. The Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The angels met the soul of a man from among
    the people who came before you, and said, Did you do anything good? He said,
    'I used to tell my employees to postpone collection of payment or to let off anyone who
    was in difficulty. So it was said, Let him off. (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari, 1935).
    The soul is taken up to heaven by two angels after it is
    taken (i.e., after a person dies), as was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who
    said: When the soul of the believer is taken, it is met by two angels who take it
    up (The narrator said: then he mentioned its good fragrance and scent of
    musk). The people of heaven say, A good soul that has come from earth, may Allaah
    bless you and the body in which you used to dwell. Then they take it up to its Lord, may
    He be glorified and exalted, then He says, Roam with it until the end of the
    world. When the disbelievers soul comes out (the narrator mentioned its
    putrid smell and curses). The people of heaven say, An evil soul that has come from
    earth, then it is said, Roam with it until the end of the world. Abu
    Hurayrah said: then the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    put a piece of cloth over his nose, like this. (Reported by Muslim, 5119).
    More information about how the soul comes out (at death)
    was reported in the hadeeth of Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) from
    al-Bara ibn Aazib who said: We went out with the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) for the funeral of a man from among the Ansaar, and we
    reached the grave whilst it was still being dug. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat down and we sat down around him, and it was as if we
    had birds on our heads. In his hand was a stick with which he was scratching in the earth.
    He raised his head and said, Seek refuge with Allaah from the punishment of the
    grave, two or three times. Then he said, Verily, when the believing slave is
    about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to him angels from
    heaven with white faces, as if their faces are the sun. They bring with them one of the
    shrouds of Paradise and some of the perfume of Paradise. They sit with him as far as the
    eye can see. Then the Angel of Death (peace be upon him) comes to him and sits by his head
    and says, O pure soul, come out to the forgiveness and pleasure of Allaah.
    Then his soul comes flowing out like a drop of water flowing from a cup. Then he takes the
    soul, and no sooner does he seize it but they take it and place it in that shroud and
    perfume. Then out of it comes the most excellent fragrance of musk to be found on the face
    of the earth. Then they ascend with it and they do not pass by any group of angels but the
    angels ask, Who is this pure soul? and they reply, It is So and so the
    son of So and so  using the best names by which he was known on earth. Then
    they bring it to the lowest heaven, and ask for it to be opened, and it is opened for him.
    Those who are of high rank in each heaven accompany it until they approach the next
    heaven, and so it goes until it reaches the seventh heaven. Then Allaah, may He be
    glorified and exalted, says: Record the book of My slave in Illiyoon (the
    highest heaven) and take him back to the earth, for I created them from it, and I shall
    return them to it, then I shall take them out from it again. Then his soul is
    returned to his body and two angels come and make him sit up, and ask him, Who is
    your Lord. He says, Allaah. They ask, What is your religion?
    He says, My religion is Islam. They ask, Who is this man that was sent
    amongst you? He says, He is the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him. They ask him, What knowledge do you have? He says,
    'I read the Book of Allaah and I believed in it. Then a voice will call out from
    heaven, My slave has spoken the truth. Prepare for him a bed from Paradise and give
    him clothes from Paradise, and open for him a door to Paradise. And he will feel its
    breeze and smell its fragrance, and his grave will be widened for him as far as his eye
    can see. Then a man with a handsome face, beautiful clothes and a pleasant fragrance will
    come to him and say, Good news! This is the day that you were promised. He
    will say, Who are you? You face looks as if it brings good news. He will say,
    'I am your good deeds. (The deceased) will say, O Lord, let the Hour come so
    that I may see my family and my wealth again. 
When the disbelieving slave is about to depart this world and enter the
    Hereafter, there come down to him angels from heaven with black faces, bringing with them
    sackcloth. They sit with him as far as the eye can see. Then the Angel of Death comes to
    him and sits by his head and says, O evil soul, come out to the wrath and anger of
    Allaah. Then his soul disperses in his body and is dragged out like a skewer being
    pulled out of wet wool. Then he takes the soul, and no sooner does he seize it but they
    take it and place it in that sackcloth. Then out of it comes the most putrid stench of
    rotten flesh to be found on the face of the earth. Then they ascend with it and they do
    not pass by any group of angels but the angels ask, Who is this evil soul? and
    they reply, It is So and so the son of So and so  using the worst names
    by which he was known on earth. Then they bring it to the lowest heaven, and ask for it to
    be opened, and it is not opened for him. Then the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
    For them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until
    the camel goes through the eye of the needle [al-Araaf 7:40]. Then he
    said, Then Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: Record the book of
    My slave in Sijjeen (the lowest Hell) in the lowest earth. Then his soul is cast
    down. Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning):  and whoever
    assigns partners to Allaah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had
    snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far off place. [al-Hajj 22:31]. He
    said, Then his soul is returned to his body and two angels come and make him sit up,
    and ask him, Who is your Lord. He says, Oh, oh, I dont know.
    They ask, What is your religion? He says, Oh, oh, I dont
    know. They ask, Who is this man that was sent amongst you? He says,
    Oh, oh, I dont know. Then a voice will call out from heaven, He is
    lying. Prepare for him a bed from Hell and open for him a door to Hell. And he will
    feel its hot winds and smell its stench, and his grave will be constricted for him until
    his ribs interlock. Then a man with an ugly face, ugly clothes and a horrible stench will
    come to him and say, Bad news! This is the day that you were warned about. He
    will say, Who are you? You face looks as if it brings bad news. He will say,
    'I am your evil deeds. (The deceased) will say, O Lord, do not let the Hour
    come! (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad, 17803; this is a saheeh hadeeth).
    At the end of time, Allaah will send a wind which will
    take the soul of every believer, as was reported in the hadeeth of al-Nawwaas ibn
    Samaan, who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) mentioned  (the coming of the Dajjaal [Antichrist] and the descent of
    Eesa [Jesus], peace be upon him, and the good life and happiness of mankind at the
    time of Jesus and afterwards). He said, And whilst the people are living like that,
    Allaah will send a good wind which will seize them under the armpits and will take the
    soul of every believer and every Muslim. The evil people will remain and they will behave
    like donkeys, then the Hour will come upon them. (Reported by Muslim,
    5228).
    When people sleep (and sleep is the lesser
    death), the soul is taken, but not completely, so the sleeper is still alive. Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning): It is Allaah Who takes away the souls at
    the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep, He keeps those (souls)
    for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this
    are signs for a people who think deeply. [al-Zumar 39:42]
The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    advised the Muslim, when he lies down to sleep, to say: Bismika Rabbee
    wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu wa in amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa
    fahfazhaa bimaa tuhfaz bihi ibaadika al-saaliheen ( In Your name, my Lord, I lie
    down, and in Your name I rise. If You should take my soul then have mercy on it, and if
    You should return my soul then protect it as You protect Your righteous slaves).
    When the Muslim wakes up, he should say, Al-hamdu Lillaah alladhi aafaani
    fi jasadi wa radda alayya roohi wa adhina li bi dhikrihi (Praise be to Allaah
    Who has restored to me my health and returned my soul and has allowed me to remember Him
    ). (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3323 He said, a hasan hadeeth).
These are a few of the aayaat and saheeh ahaadeeth which describe the
    soul. Maybe you will find in them information that will guide you to the way of truth, the
    Religion of Islam. Thank you for your question."

                Assalamu AlaykumWe have a rented place in our community used as a ""musallah""
      where we pray the five prayers and the Friday prayer. This place is not owned by the
      muslim community, it is rather rented.Does this place take the rules of the Masjid or not, like do we have to
      perfom Tahiyyat Al-Masjid each time we enter, can women enter the place during their
      period, etc?Another thing is that we rely on selling scripts from grocery stores to
      the muslims in order to cover part of the rent. This is usually done in the musallah,
      where an announcement is made after the Jumu'ah prayer, and muslims come and buy them.
      What is the rule on this? Is this considered as ""tijarah"" (or trade) that is not
      allowed to be done there??Jazakum Allah kull khair",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen,
    may Allaah preserve him, who replied as follows:
The rulings on mosques do not apply here. This is a
    musalla (prayer place), as is clear from the fact that it belongs to someone
    else, and the owner could sell it. It is a musalla and not a masjid (mosque), so the
    rulings on mosques do not apply to it.
Question:
Is it permissible to sell booklets and commercial announcements in it,
    or is that not appropriate in a musalla?
Answer:
I think that this is not appropriate even in a musalla, because it
    distracts people from remembering Allaah, and inevitably disturbs those who are praying
    there.
Question:
What about menstruating women going there? Is it OK?
Answer:
Yes. If they go and stay there, there is nothing wrong with that.
Question:
Is it necessary to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid?
Answer:
No, it is not necessary, but they should pray the usual Sunnah prayer.
Question:
Do you mean the Sunnah prayers between the two times of prayer?
Answer:
Yes.

    once in America and again when he was brought to Pakistan","Question

                A muslim from our jamaah recently
      died and his family shipped the body back to pakistan, his janaza was prayed here in new
      york and again in pakistan. My question is which is the proper janaza.Jazakalla Khairan.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is correct to offer the Janaazah prayer for
    the deceased more than once. Both prayers are valid and it is hoped that the prayers will
    be an intercession for the deceased. Ibn Qudaamah said: “If a person catches up with
    the janaazah (funeral) but did not offer the prayer, he can still pray (Salaat
    al-Janaazah) for the deceased. This was done by ‘Ali and Anas, may Allaah be pleased
    with them, and by Sulaymaan ibn Rabee’ah, Abu Hamzah and Mu’ammar ibn Sameer.
    The prayer may be offered at the graveside, and it may be repeated before the burial
    either in congregation or individually. This was stated by Ahmad, who said: “There is
    nothing wrong with that. It was done by a number of the Companions of the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” (al-Mughni,
    2/512)
    In a hadeeth, Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “The
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached a new grave, and they formed
    a row behind him, and he recited Takbeer (said “Allaahu akbar”) four
    times.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 1319, Muslim, 1586).
    Al-Sheeraazi said: “If someone comes who
    has not yet offered the (funeral) prayer for him, he should do so.” (al-Muhadhdhab
    , 1/134).
    Both the prayers are valid, because the prayer
    for the deceased may be offered more than once for a valid reason. Some of the scholars
    mentioned that it is permissible for a person who missed the funeral prayer to offer the
    prayer over him in his grave, up to a period of one month following his death. So those
    who offered the prayer for him in Pakistan did so because they had not prayed for him
    before that.
We must also point out that the Sunnah is to bury the
    deceased where he died, except in cases of necessity. So if there is a Muslim graveyard in
    the place where a person dies, he should be buried there. And Allaah knows best."

          is a dereliction of the most important duty among the pillars of Islam. 
          Prayer is the pillar and cornerstone of the faith, and it is not permissible 
          under any circumstances to be lenient towards the one who is not praying. 
          First of all his family should advise and enjoin him to pray, then they 
          should boycott him and turn away from him, and not greet him with salaam, 
          or eat with him or sit with him, in order to point out to him the seriousness 
          of sin, so that he will come back to Allaah and repent. The opinions 
          of the scholars with regard to the one who does not pray may be summed 
          up under the following two headings:  
         1.The opinion that the one who does not pray is a kaafir, which 
          is the opinion narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali and Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah 
          be pleased with them). It was also the opinion of al-Hasan, al-Sha’bi, 
          al-Oozaa’i, Ibn al-Mubaarak and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan; it was also reported 
          from Ahmad, and is indicated by the hadeeth of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “All that stands between 
          a person and kufr is his not praying.” (Reported by Muslim, Ahmad, Abu 
          Dawood and Ibn Maajah). 
2.The opinion that the one who does not pray is not a kaafir. This 
          is the opinion of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, and al-Shaafa'i, and is indicated 
          by the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, who reported that the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “There are five prayers which Allaah has prescribed 
          for His slave during the day and night, whoever does them and does not 
          wilfully neglect them, Allaah will be bound to grant him admittance 
          to Paradise. Whoever does not do them will have no such guarantee; if 
          He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will grant him admittance 
          to Paradise.” (Reported by al-Daarimi, 1531; Maalik, al-Muwatta’, 
          248; Ahmad, 21690). 
 However, according to both opinions, 
          if a person insists on not praying, he should be asked three times to 
          repent, and if he refuses, then his fate will be execution."
1167,4426,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4426,A surgeon who has    left Christianity and is asking how he could pray whilst performing surgery if he becomes    Muslim,"Question

I am currently a non-muslim but have been looking into the faith of Islam. I have a question concerning the five daily prayers as they would affect one's life. I understand that they are ment to be observed at very specific times of the day, and that this is compulsory. As a career, I have recently been leaning toward that of a surgeon. If one has a career such as this, which requires total concentration on the task at hand (where another's life is at stake), and which may take longer than the period of time between prayers, what does one do? It seems that in this sense the requirements of islam and the requirements of a rather noble profession are at odds. I'm wondering what a devout and knowledgeable muslim's thoughts are on the matter, and how these two lifestyles could be reconciled while still ""keeping the faith."" Thank you",,"Praise be to Allah.Before we answer your question, we must express our appreciation for your interest in the religion of Islam and your efforts to find out the truth. You have left a false religion, Christianity, to look for the true religion, and this is a worthy attitude which indicates that you are not influenced by blind tradition and that you have freed yourself from the customs with which you were raised. Our Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, has criticized those who blindly follow falsehood, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): When it is said to them, Follow what Allah has sent down, they say, Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following. (Would they do that!) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided? [al-Baqarah 2:170].
Allaah described some Christian people who, when they found out about the religion of Islam and heard the Revelation that Allaah had sent to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), followed the truth and submitted themselves to Him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And when they (who call themselves Christians) listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say, Our Lord! We believe; so write us down among the witnesses.
And why should we not believe in Allah in that which has come to us of the truth? And we wish that our Lord will admit us (in Paradise on the Day of Resurrection) along with the righteous people. [al-Maidah 5:83-84]
We must also express our appreciation of your understanding of the importance of the five daily prayers and the necessity of praying them at the right times. We would like at this point to reaffirm an important truth in the Islamic religion, which is that the One Who revealed it and prescribed its rules and chose this religion for His slaves is Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified, from Whom nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden. He is the Knower of the Unseen, He knows what was, what is and what is yet to come. He knew before He created heaven and earth that there would come a time when mankind would develop the science of medicine and that there would be doctors who carry out lengthy operations such as open heart surgery, organ transplants such as liver transplants, operations to treat cancer of the oesophagus, complicated operations to treat injuries sustained in traffic accidents, and so on. For this reason, and because Islam is suitable for all times and places, there is no conflict between Islam and scientific progress or work-related duties. Before we give a detailed answer to your question, we would like to mention the following points:


Operations of this nature are usually carried out by a team of surgeons, where assistant surgeons work alongside the main surgeons so that they can take turns when necessary.


Some operations are carried out by several doctors who play different roles assigned to them according to their specialties. It is not always the case that one doctor will do a whole lengthy procedure by himself from beginning to end. So you will see that one makes the incision, another is a heart doctor, a third is specialized in operating on blood vessels, then the first one comes back to sew up the incision at the end. In some operations, the role of the specialist does not even take up half of the entire time spent on the surgery.


The kinds of operations that take a very long time, such as ten hours or more, are very rare indeed, few and far between.


With regard to how a surgeon can do his prayers, the detailed answer is as follows:


The basic principle is that every prayer should be offered at the right time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours. [al-Nisa 4:103]


If the operation is lengthy, the doctor can try to start after praying one of the prayers at the beginning of its appointed time, and try to finish before the end of the time for the following prayer, so that he offers each prayer within the allotted time.


He should try to arrange his schedule, as much as possible, in such a way that the time allotted for the surgery does not overlap the time for two prayers in a row. For example, he could start a lengthy procedure early in the morning, and continue until just before the time for Asr, so that he can pray Zuhr at the right time, and also give himself several hours to work uninterrupted. So, for example, if he begins an operation at 8.00 a.m. and finishes at 2.00 p.m., he will have six hours in which to work continuously, if he wishes.


If he can go to pray at the right time during an operation, and other members of the surgical team can do his work by taking turns, then they should do that. We wonder, if doctors need to go to the washroom during an operation, what do they do? If the surgical arrangements can take that possibility into account, and we know that some surgeons take a short rest or have a snack during the time of surgery, whilst another doctor takes over, then performing prayer is even more important than those things.


If the above is not possible, then there is nothing wrong with combining two prayers, such as joining Zuhr and Asr, and praying them at the later time, i.e., the time of Asr.


In very rare cases, when the surgery lasts for a very long time, and the time for two prayers has passed, such as when a surgeon starts before Zuhr and finishes after Maghrib, and he could not leave to do his prayers, then he should pray according to his circumstances. Indeed, he can even pray during the surgery, by starting his prayer with the words Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great), reciting Quraan and tilting his head to indicate the rukoo (bowing) and sujood (prostration), as much as he can, tilting it lower for the sujood than the rukoo. This is how fighters on the front line pray when engaged in combat with the enemy during lengthy battles, or when pursuing the enemy or being pursued. He should pray according to his circumstances, and Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope [al-Baqarah 2:286 interpretation of the meaning]. Praise be to Allaah Who does not make the religion too hard for us.


The evidence for these rulings is proven, and the sayings of the scholars regarding prayer in different circumstances is well-known and widely-disseminated in the books of Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence), which clearly indicates the flexibility of this blessed religion and its ability to deal with all the new developments in the human realm, ancient and modern. This is no wonder, for has it not been revealed by the All-Wise, Praiseworthy and All-Knowing?
Finally, we call on you to hasten to enter the religion of Islam, which guarantees happiness to the one who follows it in this world and the next, and offers answers to all problems. We are prepared to answer any questions you may have. Allaah is the Source of Strength and He is the Guide to the Straight Path."

    [al-Nisa’ 4:1]
“And give to the kindred his due and to the poor…”
    [al-Isra’ 17:26]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“Allaah created His creation, and when He had finished, al-rahm
    (the tie of kinship) got up. He said, ‘What is it?’ Al-rahm said: “This is
    the position of one who is seeking refuge with You from being cut off.’ He said,
    ‘Will you not be pleased if I should take care of the one who takes care of you, and
    cut off the one who cuts you off?’ Al-rahm said, ‘Of course, O Lord.’ He
    said, ‘Then it will be so.’” Abu Hurayrah quoted (interpretation of the
    meaning): “Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the
    land, and sever your ties of kinship?” [Muhammad 47:22]. (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 6948)
Upholding the ties of kinship means being kind to one’s relatives,
    whether by giving them material things or treating them well. The least of this is
    greeting them with salaam and not forsaking them.
There is no limit in sharee’ah to the number of times a person
    should visit his or her relatives, because this will differ according to people’s
    circumstances, how busy they are, how close or how far away they live, and the
    circumstances, employment and other commitments of the husband who is to bring his wife to
    visit her family. Some wives live close to their own families, and others may live in
    another city or country, all of which are factors in the matter. But the husband should
    realize that it is not permissible for him to deliberately prevent his wife from visiting
    her family and upholding her ties of kinship with them. By the same token, the wife should
    not exhaust her husband with frequent trips and expenses that he cannot bear. She should
    make requests of him commensurate with his capabilities. We ask Allaah to put all our
    affairs right. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad."

1170,4448,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4448,Speaking about    worldly matters in the mosque,"Question

How should one behave, specially in a masjid, when the Adhan is being called? Are we allowed to talk worldly affairs while it is being called? Are we allowed to excange ""Salam"" (greetings) while it is being called?",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Haakim reported in al-Mustadrak (4/359) that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There will come a time when people will sit in circles in the mosques and they will have no concern except this world. Allah has no need of them so do not sit with them. This is a saheeh hadeeth even though al-Bukhaari and Muslim did not narrate it. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Talkhees that it is saheeh.
This hadeeth states that this blameworthy deed is disliked, because the mosques are not built for such a purpose. Allah commanded that mosques should be built to remember Him and to conduct prayers and acts of worship and obedience to Him, such as Itikaaf (retreat, seclusion for devotion and worship), and different kinds of dhikr such as circles for reciting Quran and seeking knowledge.
On the other hand, there are ahaadeeth that command us to repeat the words of the adhan after the muezzin, as a mustahabb or encouraged deed, and to set an example of how one should behave when hearing the adhan. Some people neglect this, and do not realize how much reward they are missing out on and how much they are to blame for that. What sort of hearts must they have?! They hear the remembrance of Allah then they turn away from Him, and it has no effect on their hearts so that they may fear Him and feel compelled to listen.
One of these ahaadeeth is that narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 384) from Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: When any one of you hears the muezzin, let him say something like he says, then send blessings on me, for whoever sends blessings on me, Allah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of Allahs slaves will attain, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me, will be granted my intercession for him.
As for giving the greeting of salam and shaking hands, there is nothing wrong with this, for these are acts of obedience to Allah. There is no conflict between doing these things and responding to the muezzin, because a person may do all of these things at once.
Muslims should beware of doing anything that may offend or disturb those who come to the mosque for worship. This includes disturbing those who are reading Quran, praying or remembering Allah in the mosque. It is an evil deed (sayiah) to disturb the people in the mosque by talking about worldly affairs, because this is offensive to them and distracts Muslims from doing acts of worship properly. Disturbing others is not allowed, even if it takes the form of reading Quran, so how about if it takes other forms? Ahmad ibn Shuayb al-Nisaa'i reported in al-Sunan al-Kubra (5/32) under the heading Dhikr Qawl al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Laa yajhar badukam ala badin fil-Quran (Mentioning the statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), None of you should compete with one another in reciting Quran loudly), a report from Abu Haazim al-Timaar from al-Bayaadi, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and found the people praying and reciting in loud voices. He said: The one who is praying is conversing with his Lord, so let him think about what he is saying to Him. Do not compete with one another in reciting Quran loudly. Ibn Muhayreez (may Allah have mercy on him) is reported to have said: Speaking in the mosque is idle talk, except for one who is praying, or remembering his Lord, or asking for help or giving help. (Musannaf Abd al-Razzaaq, part 8, Baab Kalaam Ikrimah). Ibn al-Haaj said, concerning the manners of the Muslim when he sets out for the mosque: He should intend to avoid idle talk in the mosque or talking about that which does not concern him, for there is a report that says that speaking in the mosque about anything but the deeds of the Hereafter is like fire in dry wood, it eats up hasanaat (good deeds). So he should take care to avoid that, lest he goes out to engage in trade and comes back having lost everything because of his idle talk. (al-Madkhal by Ibn al-Haaj, part 1, al-Sunnah fil-Mashiy ilal-Masjid).

                My husband doesn't pray 5 times a day and
      constantly, I have encouraged him to do so with no avail. Since he hasn't taken heed of my
      requests I have withheld myself from engaging in intercourse with him. He exclaims that my
      actions are inappropriate, saying that it is blasphemous for me to use prayer as an
      incentive for intercourse. Is he correct?",,"Praise be to Allah.It should be known that the one who does not pray any of
    the prayers and persists in not doing so, according to the Sahaabah and the majority of
    scholars, is counted as a kaafir and it is not permissible to marry him or eat meat
    slaughtered by him. If the husband does not pray at all, then he is taking a very serious
    risk and it is not permissible for you to stay with him. You have to remind him and scare
    him with this. Withholding yourself from having intercourse with him is the right thing to
    do, until he starts to pray, because the one who does not pray is counted as a kaafir, as
    it was reported in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Jaabir that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
All that stands between a man and shirk and kufr is his giving up
    prayer. And he also said:
The covenant that separates us from them is salaah, and whoever
    gives up prayer is a kaafir.
Abd-Allaah ibn Shaqeeq said: the companions of the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used not to count the giving up of any action as
    kufr, apart from prayer. You have to warn your husband against neglecting the
    prayer. If he persists, it is not permissible for you to stay with him because you are a
    Muslim and he is something else. May Allaah help the Muslims to do what Allaah has
    commanded and to obey Him. You have to advise and scare him, and may Allaah bring about

1175,4509,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4509,Was the Prophet Created From Light?,"Question

                Most people think that things were created from the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that his light was created from the light of Allaah. They narrate, “I am the light of Allaah and everything is from my light” and also, “The first thing that Allaah created was the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Is there any basis for this? They also narrate “I am ‘Arab without (the letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem, i.e., Ahad.” Is there any basis for this?",,"Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) has been described as being light from the light of Allaah. If what is meant
    by this is that he himself is from the light of Allaah, then this goes against the
    Qur’aan, which refers to his being human. If what is meant is that he is light in the
    sense that he brought the Revelation by which whoever Allah wills of His creation is
    guided, then this is correct. The committee has issued a fatwa concerning this matter, as
    follows:
“The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has
    light which is the light of the message and guidance from Allaah, through which Allaah
    guides whomsoever He will of His slaves. No doubt the light of the message and of guidance
    comes from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘It is not given to any human being that Allaah should speak to
    him unless (it be)by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to
    reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.
And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Roohan (an Inspiration, and a
    Mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made
    it (this Qur’aan) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And
    verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e.,
    Allaah’s religion of Islamic monotheism), -- 
The path of Allaah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all
    that is in the earth. Verily, all the matters at the end go to Allaah (for
    decision).”[al-Shura 42:51-53]
This light is not derived from the Seal of the Awliya’ as some
    heretics claim. The body of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was
    blood and flesh and bone, and so on. He was created from a father and a mother, and had no
    existence before he was born. The reports which say that the first thing created by Allaah
    was the light of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or that Allaah
    grasped a handful of the light from His Face and that this handful was Muhammad 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then He looked at it and it formed drops, and from
    each of these drops He created a Prophet, or He created all of creation from the light of
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – all of these reports and
    the like are not saheeh (authentic), and nothing like this has been narrated from the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”
From the fatwa quoted above, it is clear that this is a false belief.
As for the report which says “I am ‘Arab without (the
    letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem,
    i.e., Ahad” – the attributes of Lordship (ruboobiyah, from Rabb
    meaning Lord) and Absolute Unity (Ahad meaning One) are attributes that belong
    uniquely to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It is not permissible for any one of
    His creation to be described as “the Lord (Rabb)” or as being One (Ahad)
    in absolute terms. These are attributes that belong exclusively to Allaah, and are not
    used to describe the Messengers or any other human beings. May Allaah bless our Prophet
    Muhammad and his family and companions.

Question:
Is it said that Allaah created the heavens and earth for the purpose of
    creating the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? What is the meaning of
    the words, “Were it not for you, the universe [lit. heavenly bodies] would not have
    been created”? Is there any basis for this hadeeth (prophetic narration)? Is it saheeh (authentic) or not? Please give
    us the facts.
Answer:
The heavens and earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They were created for the reason mentioned by
    Allaah in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth
    the like thereof (i.e., seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth),
    that you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah surrounds
    (comprehends) all things in (His) Knowledge.” [al-Talaaq 65:12]
As for the hadeeth mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and has no grounds for authenticity.

1177,4524,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4524,Who do Muslims worship?,"Question

Who do Muslims worship?",,"Praise be to Allah.Before answering, we would like to express our appreciation for your interest, at such a young age, in the religion of Islam. May Allah open the door for you to find much blessing through your asking this question, and decree for you guidance such as you have never thought of. Allah [the Arabic name for the One True God – Translator] says in the Quran [the Holy Book of Islam] (interpretation of the meaning):
 “This is the Guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He will of His slaves…” [al-An’aam 6:88]
“And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam…” [al-An’aam 6:125]
With regard to this important question – who do the Muslims worship? – the answer is to be found in the Holy Quran, which is the Scripture of Islam, and in the words of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who received Revelation from his Lord.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. All praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists), the Most Beneficient, the Most Merciful, the Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e., the Day of Resurrection). You (Alone) we worship, and You (alone) we ask for help (for each and every thing).” [al-Faatihah 1:1-5]
“O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who has created you and those before you so that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:21]
“Such is Allah, your Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Creator of all things. So worship Him (Alone), and He is the Wakeel (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.” [al-An’aam 6:102]
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.” [al-Isra’ 17:23]
Muslims worship Allah [the One True God] whom all the Prophets worshipped. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya’qoob [Jacob]? When he said unto his sons, ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said, ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your fathers, Ibraaheem [Abraham], Ismaa’eel [Ishmael] and Is-haaq [Isaac], One God, and to Him we submit (in Islam).” [al-Baqarah 2:133]
The Muslims worship Allah and call others who follow different religions to worship Allah Alone, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say [O Muhammad]: ‘O People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians]: come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.’ Then, if they turn away, say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:64]
It is Allah Alone Whom Nooh [Noah] (peace be upon him) called his people to worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed, We sent Nooh [Noah] to his people and he said: ‘O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god but Him. Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day!’” [al-A’raaf 7:59]
It is Allah Alone whom the Messiah [Jesus] (peace be upon him) called people to worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Surely they have disbelieved who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah [Jesus] son of Maryam [Mary].’ But the Messiah said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.” [al-Maa’idah 5:73]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Eesa [Jesus], son of Maryam [Mary]! Did you say unto men: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours. You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden and unseen.
Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’” [al-Maa’idah 5:116-117]
When Allah spoke to His Prophet Moosa [Moses] (peace be upon him), He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, I am Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me, and perform al-Salaah [prayer] for My Remembrance.” [Ta-Ha 20:14]
Allah commanded His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as follows (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say [O Muhammad]: ‘O mankind! If you are in doubt as to my religion (Islam), then (know that) I will never worship those whom you worship, besides Allah. But I worship Allah Who causes you to die, I am commanded to be one of the believers.” [Yoonus 10:104]
It is Him Alone, with no partner or associate, Whom the angels worship and do not worship anyone or anything besides Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. And those who are near Him (i.e., the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship).” [al-Anbiya’ 21:19]
Everything that is worshipped instead of Allah can neither bring benefit nor cause harm, it can neither create nor provide. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad, to mankind); ‘How do you worship besides Allah something which has no power either to harm or to benefit you? But it is Allah Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower.’” [al-Maa’idah 5:76]
“You worship besides Allah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:17]
Having explained this, we must complete the topic by asking: why should we worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate? The answer is as follows:
Firstly: because there is nothing and nobody else in the universe that deserves to be worshipped, for Allah is the Creator and Sustainer, Who has created the universe out of nothing and has bestowed so many blessings upon us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So glorify Allah, when you come up to the evening [i.e., offer the Maghrib (sunset) and ‘Isha’ (night) prayers], and when you enter the morning [I.e., offer the Fajr (morning) prayers].
And His is all the praise and thanks in the heavens and the earth, and (glorify Him) in the afternoon [i.e., offer ‘Asr (mid-afternoon) prayer] and when you come up to the time when the day begins to decline [i.e., offer the Zuhr (mid-day) prayer].
He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living. And He revives the earth after its death, and thus shall you be brought out (resurrected).
And among His Signs is this, that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then [Hawwa (Eve) from Adam’s rib, then his offspring from the semen, and], - behold you are human beings scattered!
And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.
And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.
And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.
And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, by way of fear and hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.
And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His Command, then afterwards when He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth (ie., from your graves, for reckoning and recompense).
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him.
And He it is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has perished), and this is easier for Him. His is the highest description (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” [al-Room 30: 17-27]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!
Is not he (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allah? Nay, but most of them know not.
Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when He calls Him, and Who removes the evil, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allah? Little is it that you remember!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain)? Is there any god with Allah? High Exalted be Allah above all that they associate as partners (to Him)!
Is not He (better than your so-called gods) Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allah? Say: ‘bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful’
Say: ‘None on the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.’”
[al-Naml 27:60-65]
So is there anyone or anything besides Allah that deserves to be worshipped?
Secondly: Allah did not create us except to worship Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Thirdly: No one will be saved on the Day of Resurrection except those who used to worship Allah truly and sincerely. After death Allah will resurrect His slaves and call them to account, rewarding or punishing them according to their deeds. No one will be saved on that day except for those who used to worship Allah Alone. The rest will be gathered into a Hell, a terrible fate! The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was asked by his Companions: “Will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” He told them:
“Do you doubt that you can see the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?” We [his Companions] said, “No.” He said, “Then you should not doubt that you will see your Lord on that Day, you will see Him as you see them (the sun and moon).” Then he said, “A caller will call out, ‘Let every people go to that which they used to worship.’ So the worshippers of the cross will go with their cross, the worshippers of idols will go with their idols and the worshippers of every god will go with their gods, until there will be left those who used to worship Allah, whether they were righteous or otherwise, and a few of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians]. Then Hell will be brought and shown to them as if it is a mirage. It will be said to the Jews, ‘What did you used to worship?’ They will say, ‘We used to worship ‘Uzayr, the son of God.’ It will be said, ‘You have lied. Allah does not have a wife or son. What do you want?’ They will say, ‘We want something to drink.’ It will be said to them, ‘Drink!’ and they will fall into Hell. Then it will be said to the Christians, ‘What did you used to worship?’ They will say, ‘We used to worship the Messiah, the son of God.’ It will be said, ‘You have lied. Allah does not have a wife or son. What do you want?’ They will say, ‘We want something to drink.’ It will be said to them, ‘Drink!’ and they will fall into Hell. Then there will be left those who used to worship Allah, whether they were righteous or otherwise. It will be said to them, ‘What are you waiting for? All the people have gone.’ They will say, ‘We have separated from them and we need Him more today. We heard a caller saying that every people should follow that which they used to worship, so we are waiting for our Lord.’ He will say, ‘Al-Jabbaar [the Compeller, i.e., Allah] will come…’ And He will say, ‘I am your Lord.’ They will say, ‘You are our Lord,’ but none will speak to Him except the Prophets… then every believer will prostrate to Him.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6886). These believers are the people of Paradise on whom shall be no fear neither shall they grieve, and they will dwell therein forever.
We hope that this matter has now become clear. In conclusion we can say nothing except that which Allah has said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss…” [al-Isra’ 17:15]
Peace be upon him who follows the guidance."
1178,4526,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4526,Muslim holidays & symbol,"Question

                Do Islams have certain holidays that christans don't if so what are they?
What is your holy symbol like ours is the cross, do you have a specific symbol?",,"Praise be to Allah.Muslims have only two Holy days to celebrate. The two
    Holy days are Eid Alfitir, which follows the holy month of Ramadan, and Eid Aladha, which
    is in the Hajj (holy pilgrimage) season. Muslims celebrate Eid Aladha by slaughtering a
    sheep. The slaughtering of sheep is done in following the footsteps of Prophet Abraham
    when he was ordered by Allah (God) to slaughter his first child, Ishmael. When he told his
    son about it, his son told him to carry on with the order of Allah, and that he will be
    obedient and patient. As Abraham was tempting to slaughter Ishmael, Allah gave them a big
    and fat sheep to slaughter instead. The sacrificing of a sheep has become a ritual for
    Muslims every year in remembrance of the obedience of Abraham and Ishmael, peace be upon
    them. Our celebration of this day and the slaughtering of the sheep are in compliance with
    the teachings of our Prophet Mohammad, praising and peace of Allah be upon him. Only
    Muslims celebrate these two days, while at the same time, Muslims do not celebrate the
    Christian holidays.
    As for the symbol, Muslims worship Allah (God), therefor they reject
    any kind of idol worshipping. We believe that Christians believe in the cross to be a
    symbol of their God, or the so claimed Son of God. They seek blessing and protection from
    this cross. Muslims seek protection and blessing only from Allah, that is why we do not
    have an Islamic symbol as the Christians cross. Some Muslims have invented the
    symbol of a crescent to counter the cross, but this is not authentic and it is considered
    as an innovation in Islam."
1179,4536,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4536,Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?,"Question

According to Hadith (by Muslim) there is reward for husband & wife's sexual intercourse. I heard that this reward is equivalent to the merit point of 70 Rak`ah of optional prayer. Is it true?","Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfill the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of prohibited things, and other good intentions.","Praise be to Allah.Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?
 If a man has intercourse with his wife , he will be rewarded for that, because he is doing something permissible and avoiding something forbidden. This is what is stated in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
 It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give in charity from their excess wealth.” He said, “Has not Allah given you things with which you can give charity? Every Tasbihah (saying `Subhan Allah’ (Glory be to Allah)) is a charity. Every ‘Takbirah’ (saying `Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)) is a charity. Every ‘Tahmidah’ (saying `Al-hamdu-Lillah’ (praise be to Allah)) is a charity. Every Tahlilah (saying `La ilaha ill-Allah’ (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with one’s wife) is a charity.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a haram way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halal way, he will have a reward for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1674) 
Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The phrase, `Having intercourse is a charity’ – the word bud’ (translated here as `having intercourse’ ) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself…
This indicates that permissible actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of haram things, and other good intentions. `O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?’” (Sharh Muslim, 7/92)
Is the reward of sex in Islam equivalent to 70 Sunnah prayers?
 With regard to your comment that the reward of sex in Islam is equivalent to seventy optional prayers”
Perhaps this question about the reward for having intercourse with one’s wife comes from your reading of Imam An-Nawawi’s commentary on Sahih Muslim (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Sahih Muslim). It is a comment which we will quote below, where the Shaykh (An-Nawawi – may Allah have mercy on him) was discussing the issue of enjoining what is good and saying that it is obligatory. Then he discussed the issue of saying Tasbih and Dhikr, which he noted is Sunnah. Then he explained that the obligatory act of worship is equivalent to seventy times the Sunnah act, and said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith… Then at the end of this discussion he referred to the phrase “Having intercourse…” 
If this is indeed the case, then you should note that the first comment has nothing to do with what follows it. The phrase “from a Hadith” means from some Hadith, but Imam An-Nawawi does not quote it. When he finishes discussing the issue of obligatory and Sunnah acts of worship, and the status of each, he then starts his discussion of the phrase “Having intercourse...” So the confusion has arisen from this juxtaposition.
This is what we think. But if you mean that the reward for obligatory acts of worship is equivalent to the reward for seventy Sunnah acts, then An-Nawawi did discuss this point and said that there was a Hadith about it, but he did not quote it.
 We know what An-Nawawi was referring to, and this is what was pointed out by Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).
 Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
 “Note:
In Ziyadat Ar-Rawdah, An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the Imam of the Haramayn from some of the scholars that the reward for an obligatory act of worship is seventy times more than the reward for a Sunnah act. An-Nawawi said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith.”
 The Hadith in question was quoted by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) in An-Nihayah. It is the Marfu` Hadith of Salman concerning the month of Ramadan: “Whoever seeks to draw closer to Allah during (this month) by doing some good deeds will be like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and one who does an obligatory action (during Ramadan) will be like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other time.”
 This is an inauthentic Hadith which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him), but he was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not.” ((At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/118)
 What he meant (may Allah have mercy on him) by saying that Ibn Khuzaymah was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not may be understood more clearly by referring to Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (3/191), where he includes it under the chapter heading, Bab Fada’il Sharh Ramadan in Sahha Al-Khabr (Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadan, if the report is authentic).
 And the chain of transmission of this Hadith includes `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, who is a weak narrator.

    caused at a private school","Question

                i have a deaf sister who became
      deaf due to cannoing at school a couple of years ago, My questions are,1.how much islamic Obligation is on someone who is completely
      deaf?2. are we allowed to claim compensation from the school through
      their insurance which should cover such accidents?jazakhallah khairan for your time, effort and truthful answears.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, so long as the deaf person is
    responsible and of sound mind, he is obliged to do all the duties that he is able to
    fulfil.
With regard to the second question, we put this question to
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who said:
How did she become deaf?
We said: through an accident that happened at school, such as
    a table or chair falling on her, which caused her to become deaf. The school considered
    itself to be responsible for that.
He replied: the responsible party is the one who caused the
    accident. If it happened that there is no one who can be held responsible, then it is not
    permissible for her to accept the compensation.
Question:
Suppose that the school or its administration was
    responsible, and it is a private school that is run for profit?
Answer:
The compensation is to be paid by the one who caused the
    accident. If someone moved the table or an electrical cable and it fell on this girl, then
    he is responsible and has to pay compensation.
Question:
If, according to the system in that country, the school is
    obliged to pay compensation, can these people take it as per the system?
Answer:
The man is a Muslim, he cannot take people’s wealth
    except in a lawful manner. And Allaah knows best."

    obey his father with regard to where he gives his charity?","Question

                I like to give charity to organisations
      such as Muslim aid, but my parents are against this, as they would prefer the money to be
      given to relatives ( although my dad is already giving them money).Also as my parents
      would prefer me to keep the money within the family can i give charity without telling
      them, as one of the hadiths says that ""i and all my wealth belong to my father""?
      Another related question is that can my father pay zakat and the qurbani on my behalf as
      he is the head of the family? Jazakhallah Khairan",,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen:
“I like to give my charity to charitable organizations but my
    father opposes this. He prefers to give it to relatives, and wants to make me do likewise.
    Does the hadeeth ‘You and your wealth belong to your father’ also mean that a
    father can control his son’s charitable giving?”
He answered, may Allaah preserve him:
“The hadeeth does not mean this, except if the father wants to
    take possession of the wealth himself, in which case there is nothing wrong (with him
    giving it as he sees fit), provided that this is not a trick to stop his son giving
    charity. But we nevertheless advise the son to give the charity to relatives, because this
    is preferable.”
The father does not have the right to oblige his son to give his
    charity to certain people and to prevent him from giving to others, but it is preferable
    for the son to respond to his father’s wishes, so long as he is advising him to do
    something good, which is upholding the ties of kinship by financial means. If the amount
    of money is large and there are people who need it more than the relatives, then he could
    give some of it to his relatives and some to others who are in need, or to Islamic
    charitable projects. With regard to the hadeeth, “You and your wealth belong to your
    father,” this was reported by Ibn Maajah (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Sunan
    from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, who narrated that a man said: “O Messenger of
    Allaah, I have wealth and children, but my father wants to take all of my wealth for his
    own needs.” He said, “You and your wealth belong to your father.” (Sunan
    Ibn Maajah, no. 2282. It says in al-Zawaa’id: its isnaad is saheeh and its
    men are thiqaat according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari).

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm Belief.
Or are with them the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like?”[al-Toor 52:35-37]
“Verily, the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water (rain) which Allaah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed aayaat (proofs, evidences, signs) for people of understanding.”[al-Baqarah 2:164]
“It is He Who sends down water (rain) from the sky, and with it We bring forth vegetation of all kinds, and out of it We bring forth green stalks, from which We bring forth thick clustered grain. And out of the date-palm and its spathe come forth clusters of dates hanging low and near, and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety and taste). Look at their fruits when they begin to bear, and the ripeness thereof. Verily! In these things there are signs for people who believe.”[al-An’aam 6:99]
“And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain), till when they have carried a heavy-laden cloud, We drive it to a land that is dead, then We cause water (rain) to descend thereon. Then We produce every kind of fruit therewith. Similarly, We shall raise up the dead, so that you may remember or take heed.”[al-A’raaf 7:57]
“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We parted them? And We have made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?”[al-Anbiya’ 21:30]
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!”[al-Naml 27:60]
“He has created the heavens and the earth without any pillars that you see, and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it should shake with you. And He has scattered therein moving (living) creatures of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.”[Luqmaan 31:10]

Yet of mankind in he who disputes about Allaah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light!”[Luqmaan 31:20]
“And the two seas (kinds of water) are not alike, this fresh, sweet and pleasant to drink, and that saltish and bitter. And from them both you eat fresh tender meat (fish), and derive the ornaments that you wear. And you see the ships cleaving (the sea-water as they sail through it), that you may seek of His Bounty, and that you may give thanks.”[Faatir 35:12]
“Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow? If He willed, He could have made it still – then We have made the sun its guide [i.e., after the sunrise, it (the shadow) contracts and vanishes at noon, and then again appears in the afternoon with the decline of the sun, and had there been no sunlight, there would have been no shadow]
Then We withdraw it to Us – a gradual concealed withdrawal.
And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you, and the sleep (as) repose, and makes the day nushoor (i.e., getting up and going about here and there for daily work, etc., after one’s sleep at night or like resurrection after one’s death).
And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain), and We send down pure water from the sky, -
That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We had created,”
[al-Furqaan 25:45-49]
“And it is He Who has let free the two seas (kinds of water), one palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter, and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.”
[al-Furqaan 25:53]
“And a sign for them is the dead land. We gave it life, and We brought forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof.
And We have made therein gardens of date-palms and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein.
So that they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks?
Glory be to Him, Who has created all the pairs of that which the earth produces, as well as of their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.
And a sing for them is the night. We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are in darkness.
And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.
And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk.
It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.
And a sign for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nooh).
And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.
And if We will, We shall drown them, and there will be no shout (or helper) for them (to hear their cry for help) nor will they be saved,
Unless it be a mercy from Us, and as an enjoyment for a while.”
[Yaa-Seen 36:33-44]
“We created you, then why do you believe not?

We have decreed death unto you all, and We are not unable,
To transfigure you and create you in (forms) that you know not.
And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation (i.e., the creation of Adam). Why then do you not remember or take heed?
Tell Me! The seed that you sow in the ground.

If We willed, We verily could make it salt (and undrinkable). Why then do you not give thanks (to Allaah)?
Tell Me! The fire which you kindle,
Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower?
We have made it a Reminder (for the Hell-fire, in the Hereafter); and an article of use for the travellers (and all others, in this world).
The glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
So I swear by mawaaqi’ (setting to the mansions, etc.) of the stars (they traverse),
And verily, that is indeed a great oath, if you but knew,
That (this) is indeed an honourable recital (the Noble Qur’aan).”

He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living. And He revives the earth after its death, and thus shall you be brought out (resurrected).
And among His Signs is this, that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then [Hawwa (Eve) from Adam’s rib, then his offspring from the semen, and], - behold you are human beings scattered!
And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.
And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.
And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.
And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, by way of fear and hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.
And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His Command, then afterwards when He will call you by single call, behold, you will come out from the earth (i.e, from your graves, for reckoning and recompense).
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him.
And He it is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has perished), and this is easier for Him. His is the highest description (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”[al-Room 30: 17-27]
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!
Is not he (better than you gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not.
Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when He calls Him, and Who removes the evil, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allaah? Little is it that you remember!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah above all that they associate as partners (to Him)!
Is not He (better than your so-called gods) Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say: ‘bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful’
Say: ‘None on the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allaah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.’”

Can you tell me detailed information on the importance of saying salam and saying wa-alaikum as-salam?",The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) made spreading salam a part of faith. Salam sows seeds of love and friendship in the hearts of Muslims. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) commanded us to return salam and made it a right and a duty.,"Praise be to Allah.Custom of greeting before Islam
All people have the custom of greeting one another, and every group has its own distinctive greeting that distinguishes them from other people.
The Arabs used to greet one another with the words An`im sabahan or An`imu sabahan [equivalent to Good morning, Translator], using words derived from al-ni`mah, which means good living after the morning. The idea was that because the morning is the first part of the day, if a person encounters something good in the morning, the rest of the day will be good too.
 Manner of greeting among Muslims 
When Islam came, Allah prescribed that the manner of greeting among Muslims should be Al-salamu ‘alaykum, and that this greeting should only be used among Muslims and not for other nations. 
The meaning of salam (literally, peace) is harmlessness, safety and protection from evil and from faults. 
The name al-Salam is a Name of Allah, may He be exalted, so the meaning of the greeting of salam which is required among Muslims is, May the blessing of His Name descend upon you. The usage of the preposition ‘ala in ‘alaykum (upon you) indicates that the greeting is inclusive.
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Badai' al-Fawaid (144):
“Allah, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Peace, prescribed that the greeting among the people of Islam should be al-salamu ‘alaykum, which is better than all the greetings of other nations which include impossible ideas or lies, such as saying, May you live for a thousand years, or things that are not accurate, such as An`im sabahan (Good morning), or actions that are not right, such as prostrating in greeting. Thus the greeting of salam is better than all of these, because it has the meaning of safety which is life, without which nothing else can be achieved. So this takes precedence over all other aims or objectives. A person has two main aims in life: to keep himself safe from evil, and to get something good. Keeping safe from evil takes precedence over getting something good.” 
Importance of salam in Islam
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made spreading salam a part of faith. Al-Bukhari (12, 28 and 6236), Muslim (39), Ahmad (2/169), Abu Dawud (5494), al-Nasai, (8/107) and Ibn Hibban (505) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): What is the best thing in Islam?, He said: Feeding others and giving the greeting of salam to those whom you know and those whom you do not know.
Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (1/56):
“I.e., do not single out anybody out of arrogance or to impress them, but do it to honour the symbols of Islam and to foster Islamic brotherhood.”
Ibn Rajab said in al-Fath (1/43):
“The hadith makes the connection between feeding others and spreading salam because this combines good actions in both word and deed, which is perfect good treatment (ihsan). Indeed, this is the best thing that you can do in Islam after the obligatory duties.”
Al-Sanusi said in Ikmal al-Mu’allim (1/244):
“What is meant by salam is the greeting between people, which sows seeds of love and friendship in their hearts, as does giving food. There may be some weakness in the heart of one of them, which is dispelled when he is greeted, or there may be some hostility, which is turned to friendship by the greeting.”
Al-Qadi said in Ikmal al-Mu’allim (1:276):
“Here the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was urging the believers to soften their hearts. The best Islamic attitude is to love one another and greet one another, and this is achieved by words and deeds. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged the Muslims to foster love between one another by exchanging gifts and food, and by spreading salam , and he forbade the opposite, namely forsaking one another, turning away from one another, spying on one another, seeking out information about one another, stirring up trouble and being two faced.
Love is one of the duties of Islam and one of the pillars of the Islamic system. One should give salams to those whom one knows and those whom one does not know, out of sincerity towards Allah; one should not try to impress other people by giving salams only to those whom one knows and no-one else. This also entails an attitude of humility and spreading the symbols of this ummah through the word of salam.
Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that this salam spreads love and brotherhood. Muslim (54), Ahmad (2/391), and al-Tirmidhi (2513) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you about something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread salam amongst yourselves.”
Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said in al-Ikmal (1/304):
“This is urging us to spread salam, as mentioned above, among those whom we know and those whom we do not know. Salam is the first level of righteousness and the first quality of brotherhood, and it is the key to creating love. By spreading salam the Muslims’ love for one another grows stronger and they demonstrate their distinctive symbols and spread a feeling of security amongst themselves. This is the meaning of Islam.
Reward for giving salam
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also explained the reward earned by the one who says salam, as was reported by al-Nasai in ‘Amal al-yawm wal-laylah (368) and al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (586) and by Ibn Hibban (493). They reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was sitting with some others, and said Salam ‘alaykum (peace be upon you). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, [He will have] ten hasanat (rewards). Another man passed by and said Salam ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, [He will have] twenty hasanat. Another man passed by and said Salam ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, [He will have] thirty hasanat.
Importance of returning salam
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to return salams , and made it a right and a duty. Ahmad (2/540), al-Bukhari (1240), Muslim (2792), al-Nsai in al-Yawm wal-Laylah (221) and Abu Dawud (5031) all reported that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Muslim has five rights over his fellow-Muslim: he should return his salams, visit him when he is sick, attend his funeral, accept his invitation, and pray for mercy for him [say Yarhamuk Allah] when he sneezes.
It is clear that it is obligatory to return salams, because by doing so a Muslim is giving you safety and you have to give him safety in return. It is as if he is saying to you, I am giving you safety and security, so you have to give him the same, so that he does not get suspicious or think that the one to whom he has given salam is betraying him or ignoring him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that if Muslims are ignoring or forsaking one another, this will be put to an end when one of them gives salam. Al-Bukhari (6233) reported that Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other if they meet. The better of them is the first one to say salam.

    defiantly with her husband in discussions on fiqh","Question

                A wife is constantly arguing with her
      husband about matters of the deen for which there are 2 legal opinions. This is upsetting
      the husband and could break up the marriage.She says I can argue with you because the wives of the Prophet often
      used to challenge and argue with him. However, she is often too ""up-front"" and
      disrespectful.What advice can you offer this couple, in particular the wife?Please, answer this question as this is turning into a bad situation
      between the spouses.",,"Praise be to Allah.The advice we give to these two spouses is that they are
    both creatures who should submit themselves to the laws of Allaah, because this is where
    happiness lies. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as
    regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards
    obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable…” [al-Baqarah 2:228] 
So both spouses must treat the other kindly. Marriage is based on
    love, not on defiance or provocation, because these usually occur between enemies, and if
    they happen between people who love one another, they usually cause hatred and do the
    couple no good. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives
    from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you
    affection and mercy…” [al-Room 30:21]
So the husband should debate with his wife in a gentle manner, and
    approach her with the intention of winning her over, not of imposing his views. He should
    give her room for polite debate, and he should realize that it is not right for him to
    impose any view on her in a matter of fiqh that concerns her alone. He has nothing to do
    with it if she is convinced of a different scholar’s opinion, and she is permitted to
    follow that scholar. The wife must be aware that the husband’s rights are great, that
    obeying him is obligatory and that pleasing him is part of pleasing Allaah. ‘Abd
    al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf said: “The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month
    (Ramadaan), guards her modesty and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, “Enter
    Paradise through whichever gate of Paradise you wish.”’” (Reported
    by Imaam Ahmad, 1573; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 660). The Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, “If I were to command anyone
    to prostrate to anything other than Allaah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to
    their husbands. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman will fulfil her
    duty towards her Lord unless she fulfils her duty towards her husband, and if he asks her
    for herself when she is sitting on a saddle, she should not refuse him.” The phrase
    “he asks her for herself” refers to the husband asking for intercourse, and the
    phrase “on a saddle” refers to the saddle used for riding a camel. The hadeeth
    is urging women to obey their husbands and if they cannot refuse them when they are in
    this situation (i.e., about to ride off on a camel) then how can they refuse them in other
    cases? (Hadeeth reported by Ibn Maajah, 1843; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’,
    5239, 5295). The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “It is not right for any human being to prostrate to another; if it were right for
    one human being to prostrate to another, I would have commanded women to prostrate to
    their husbands because of the great rights that they have over them. By the One in Whose
    hand is my soul, if a man were covered from head to foot with weeping sores oozing pus,
    and his wife were to come to him and lick his sores (to clean them), this would not fulfil
    the rights he has over her.’” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 12153; Saheeh
    al-Jaami’, 7725). 
    If the wife obeys her husband and treats him well for
    the sake of Allaah, she will earn a great reward with Allaah. By the same token, the man
    has to be patient with her, treat her well, win her over and teach her what his
    shar’i rights over her are.
With regard to her comment that the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to argue with him a lot and challenge him, this is
    not right at all. They are far above such things. They asked him to spend on them at a
    time when he had nothing, and he did not have to spend more than Allaah had bestowed upon
    him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man
    whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given
    him…”[al-Talaaq 65:7]
After this, they never repeated their demands again, may Allaah be
    pleased with them.
One time, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    entered upon one of his wives and she gave him honey to drink. Two other wives got jealous
    because he stayed there for a long time, just to drink the honey. So they agreed that each
    of them would say that she could smell an unpleasant odour and would comment that the bees
    that had produced this honey had eaten from a tree that was not good. The Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was always anxious about having an unpleasant odour.
    Allaah rebuked them when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“If you two (wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), namely ‘Aa’ishah and Hafsah) turn in repentance to Allaah,
    (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likes), but if you help one another
    against him (Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), then verily, Allaah
    is his Mawla (Lord, or Master, or Protector, etc.), and Jibreel, and the righteous among
    the believers, - and furthermore, the angels – are his helpers.” [al-Tahreem
    66:4]
So they never did such a thing again, may Allaah be pleased with
    them. So how can this woman forget about the good deeds of the Mothers of the Believers
    and their good treatment of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),
    which are so well known, and fail to follow their example in this, then try to use as
    evidence the mistakes which some of them made, which were corrected by Allaah, and which
    they never did again?
May Allaah help you both to do that which He loves and which pleases
    Him, and may He reconcile between you."

      who she wanted to marry. Her parents has disapproved of her choice and they are forcing
      her to marry that guy. The guy who she likes is also muslim and very much devoted into
      islam. But just because the society would not talk about them they don't like the guy who
      she loves. Any suggestions??",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a woman to be made to marry
    someone she does not want. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said: A previously-married woman should not be married without being consulted,
    and a virgin should not be married without asking her permission. They said, O
    Messenger of Allaah, how is her permission given? He said, By her
    silence. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6455).
    Aaishah reported that a girl came to her and
    said, My father married me to his brothers son in order to raise his social
    standing, and I did not want this marriage [I was forced into it].
    Aaishah said, Sit here until the Prophet

    came and she told him about the girl. The Prophet

    O Messenger of Allaah, I have accepted what my father did, but I wanted to prove
    something to other women. (Reported by al-Nisaai, 3217).
    So, both the guardian and the woman must agree to the
    marriage. With regard to your request for our advice regarding the problem mentioned in
    the question, so long as this marriage has taken place, it is better for the woman to try
    to keep it going as much as she can, and to try to accept this husband. She should seek
    reward through pleasing her parents and also try to reform her husband through a gentle
    approach and praying for guidance for him. And Allaah is the Source of Strength."

                I was womndering if it is true that there is no evidence that there is
      no trace of a Qu'ran being written in the 7 th century",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a false and incorrectstatement made by those who try to find faults with
      Islam so as to put people off this religion. It is sufficient to know that
      Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan, as He says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily,
      We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely,
      We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]
 Moreover, the fact that the transmission
      of the Qur’aan by memory and in writing was mutawaatir – narrated by
      groups to groups [to such anextent
      that so many people could not conceivably have agreed upon a lie] – is
      well known to anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with Islamic
      knowledge, especially knowledge of recitations and reciters. 
 There are still many people nowadays who
      have learned the Qur’aan orally, with isnaads directly going back to the
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
 One of the miracles of Allaah’s
      protection of the Qur’aan is the fact that those who try to tamper with
      it are always found out.
 The point is, everything that was
      revealed to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      was written down in front of him straight away, and some of the Sahaabah
      had masaahif (written copies
      of the Qur’aan). After the death of the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him), thefirst khaleefah, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with
      him) gathered the Qur’aan inwritten
      and kept it. Then the third khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may
      Allaah be pleased with him) compiled it in mus-hafs that were based on the
      mus-haf compiled by Abu Bakr, in addition to what had been memorized.
When
      we realize that the Qur’aan was written down and compiled by the
      Sahaabah, and ‘Uthmaan sent copies of the Mus-haf during his reign to
      all the main centres of Islam, so that it would be a reference for them,
      and there were no disputes concerning them, then how can we say that there
      is no written trace of the Qur’aan in the seventh century? Moreover,
      there are several ancient manuscripts of the Qur’aan in libraries and
      museums which bear visible testimony to the fact that nothing has been
      changed in the Book of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“And
      verily, it is an honourable well‑fortified respected Book (because
      it is Allaah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption).
      Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down
      by the All‑Wise, Worthy of all
      praise (Allaah).” [Fussilat 41:41-42]

I understand that plucking the eybrows is prohibited in Islam. I have the following questions. 1) Can the eybrow hairs be trimmed? 2) Can the eybrow hairs be lightened in color (for example from brown to blond)?
Please provided daleel.",,"Praise be to Allah.Namas is the word used to describe plucking the eyebrows. According to a saheeh hadith, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The woman who plucks facial hair and the woman who has this done are cursed.” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).
Namas means plucking the hair, or it was said that it means plucking the facial hair. “The woman who plucks facial hair” is the woman who removes hair from her own face or the face of another woman. “The woman who has this done” refers to a woman who plucks hair from her own face or tells another woman to do this for her. Minmaas refers to tweezers, the tool used to remove a thorn. When a woman removes hair from her face, this can also be done by using a thread. This also includes thinning the eyebrows.
The fuqaha’ agreed that plucking the eyebrow hair is included in the removal of facial hair, which is forbidden because of the hadith: “Allah has cursed the women who pluck their facial hair and the women who have this done.”
The majority of fuqaha’ said that removing facial hair other than the eyebrows is also included in Namas, and the fuqaha’ agreed that the prohibition on Namas in the hadith should be understood to mean that it is haraam.
Removing facial hair is also forbidden for men. (Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 14, Tanammus).
Al-Haytami said: as for removing some of the eyebrow hairs if they have grown long, I do not see anything wrong with this according to our companions, but it should be makrooh because it is changing the creation of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Nothing concerning this was narrated so it should be makrooh. (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra by Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, part 4, Baab al-‘Aqeeqah).
If the eyebrows have grown so long that they are troublesome or causing harm such as preventing one from seeing properly, then the part that is causing the problem may be trimmed.
With regard to dyeing the eyebrows or a part of them with a blonde colour or a colour similar to that of the skin, there is nothing wrong with this, as was stated in a fatwa issued by our Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him and raise his status). He also stated in a fatwa that it is permissible to remove hair growing between the eyebrows because this is not part of them, but he stated that it is not permissible to trim the eyebrows if they are not troublesome or causing harm.

    make the effort to find out where he is, then send the money to him, or else go and see
    him and give him what is due to him, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah

    and his honour.” It is not permissible for you to take the matter lightly. If you are
    unable to find him, then give the money in charity on his behalf, with the intention of
    repaying him too. If you then find him, then give him the choice between getting what is
    owed to him, in which case you will have the reward of giving in charity, or accepting the
    fact that you gave it in charity, in which case the reward will be his. Allaah says

What are the things that Allah taught to Adam?",,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (1/256, ed. by Abu Ishaaq al-Huwayni), commenting on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)…” [al-Baqarah 2:31]
“The correct view is that He taught him the names of all things, what they are, and their qualities, right down to the noiseless fart, i.e., the names and qualities of all things, great and small. Thus al-Bukhari said in his commentary on this aayah in Kitaab al-Tafseer in his Saheeh, and Ibn Katheer mentioned al-Bukhari’s isnaad from Anas, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The believers will assemble on the Day of Resurrection and will say, ‘Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.’ So they will go to Adam and say, ‘You are the father of all the people. Allah created you with His own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things…’” This indicates that Allah taught him the names of all created things, which is why He then said (interpretation of the meaning): “… then He showed them to the angels” [al-Baqarah 2:31] – i.e., the objects whose names He had taught to Adam.”
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar listed various opinions on this topic in al-Fath (8/10), where he said, “There was some dispute as to the meaning of the ‘names.’ It was suggested that this referred to the names of his offspring, or the names of the angels, or the names of the different species – without going into details, or the names of everything on earth, or the names of all things, even a platter.”
Imaam al-Shawkaani said in Fath al-Qadeer (1/64): “The ‘names’ are phrases or expressions, and what is meant is the names of the objects whose names Allah taught him. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and this is the true meaning of the word ism (name). This is confirmed by the word all (all the names), which indicates that He taught him all the names and did not omit anything, no matter what it was.”

1196,4631,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4631,Broken ties of kinship and  relationships,"Question

What is the meaning of silat al-rahm (upholding the ties of kinship)?",,"Praise be to Allah.Islam calls for the upholding of the ties of kinship because of the great effect that this has on achieving social cohesion and perpetuating cooperation and love among the Muslims. Upholding the ties of kinship is a duty because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of ) the wombs (kinship)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:1]
“And give to the kindred his due and to the miskeen (poor)…” [al-Isra’ 17:26]
Allah has warned us against cutting the ties of kinship (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who break the Covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e., they will be far away from Allah’s Mercy); And for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e., Hell).” [al-Ra’d 13:25]
What punishment could be worse than the curse and the evil home that awaits those who sever the ties of kinship ? They deny themselves the reward for upholding the ties of kinship in the Hereafter, in addition to denying themselves much good in this world, which is a long life and ample provision. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be increased and his life to be extended, should uphold the ties of kinship.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5986 and Muslim, 2557). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah created the universe, and when He had finished, kinship (al-rahm) stood up and said, “This is the standing up of one who seeks Your protection from being cut off.” Allah said, “Yes, would it please you if I were to take care of those who take care of you and cut off those who cut you off?” It said, “Of course.” Allah said, “Then your prayer in granted.”’” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Recite, if you wish (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.’ [Muhammad 47:22-23].” (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 16/112).
Once we understand this, we need to ask: who is the one who upholds the ties of kinship? This was explained by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “The one who maintains a relationship with his relatives only because they maintain a relationship with him is not truly upholding the ties of kinship. The one who truly upholds those ties is the one who does so even if they break off the relationship.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5645).
If the relationship is merely one of returning favours and giving like in return for like, and not taking the initiative, then this is not upholding the ties of kinship, it is only responding in kind. Some people follow the principle of giving a gift in return for a gift, and visiting in return for a visit, so if someone does not give them a gift, they do not give him a gift, and if he does not visit them, they do not visit him. This is not what is meant by upholding the ties of kinship at all, and this is not what is required by Islam. This is merely responding in kind, it is not the higher degree which Islam urges us to reach. A man said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot dust in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.” (Reported by Muslim with commentary by al-Nawawi, 16/115). Who could bear to put up with hot dust? We seek refuge with Allah from cutting off the ties of kinship."

I intend to go for Hajj this year, if Allah wills, and I want to travel from Riyadh to Jeddah by air. When exactly should I enter ihram?.",,"Praise be to Allah.Your meeqaat in this case is Qarn al-Manaazil, which nowadays is called al-Sayl al-Kabeer. 
The one who passes by the meeqaat has to enter ihram from that point. If he does not pass it then he has to enter ihram when he comes in line with it on land, on the sea or in the air. So you have to enter ihram when the plane comes in line with it. As the plane will pass the meeqaat quickly, there is nothing wrong with entering ihram a little before that, in order to be on the safe side. 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen said: 
If there is no meeqaat on a person’s route, he should enter ihram when he comes in line with the nearest place to it, whether he is coming by land, by sea or by air. Airplane passengers should enter ihram when they come in line with the meeqaat or, to be on the safe side, before they reach it, so that they will not pass it before entering ihram. Whoever enters ihram after passing the meeqaat has to offer a sacrifice. and Allah knows best. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/198 
From Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
Jeddah is not a meeqaat for Hajj or ‘Umrah, except for its citizens and residents, and for those who come to it for a reason other than Hajj or ‘Umrah, then decide to go for Hajj or ‘Umrah. But those who have a meeqaat before Jeddah, such as Dhu’l-Hulayfah for the people of Madeenah and places beyond, or who come in line with it on land or in the air, or al-Jahfah for those who live there, or who come in line with it on land, on the sea or in the air, or such as Yalamlam as well, have to enter ihram from their own meeqaat or when they come in line with it in the air or on the sea or on land. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah. 11/130 
The evidence for entering ihram from a point that is in line with the meeqaat is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1458) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When these two cities – meaning Kufa and Basrah – were conquered, they came to ‘Umar and said, “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) defined the meeqaat for the people of Najd as being Qarn, but it is out of our way, and if we want to go to Qarn it is too difficult for us.” He said, “Look for a place on your route that is in line with it,” and he defined Dhaat ‘Irq for them (as their meeqaat). 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (3/389): 
“Look for a place that is in line with it” means find a place that is parallel with the meeqaat and make that your meeqaat. 
It should be noted that it is not Sunnah to enter ihram before reaching the meeqaat, because this is not what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if a person is in a plane and cannot stop at the place that is in line with the meeqaat, then he may do what he thinks is more on the safe side so that he will not pass the meeqaat without being in ihram. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It was not narrated from any of those who performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that they entered ihram before Dhu’l-Hulayfah. If there was no meeqaat they then they would enter ihram before it, so this would be more difficult and would bring a greater reward.

    this world","Question

                Is the principle of pleasure forbidden
      in Islam? What is the view of Islam concerning physical pleasure, because the religion is
      a bunch of hard and strict duties.",,"Praise be to Allah.The pleasures of this world are of three types.
Pleasures which will be followed by a greater pain, or which make a
        person miss out on a greater pleasure. These are the pleasures enjoyed by sinners and
        negligent people to varying degrees, such as those who enjoy zina (illegal sexual
        conduct), drinking wine, stealing, and so on. It will be said to them on the Day of
        Resurrection (interpretation of the meaning):

“You received your good things in the life of the world, and you
      took your pleasure therein…” [al-Ahqaaf 46:20]
Pleasures which will not be punished in the Hereafter, but
        overindulgence causes a person to miss out on achieving higher levels and keeps him from
        earning reward. These are the permissible pleasures of those who are negligent, which they
        do not do in order to better themselves or to earn reward, and they have no intention of
        worship when they do these things. Examples include going to extremes in matters of food,
        drink, transportation, accommodation, travelling and going on vacation, and other things
        that are not inherently harmful or sinful.
Pleasures for which a person will be rewarded. These pleasures belong
        exclusively to the believers who let themselves enjoy them on the grounds of doing their
        duty towards themselves, seeking help thereby to obey Allaah, and helping to keep
        themselves away from sin.
On the basis of these noble aims, these pleasures may be classified as
      acts of obedience towards Allaah, concerning which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will be pleased with a slave who eats some food
      then praises Allaah for it, and drinks some drink then praises Allaah for it.” (Reported
      by Muslim, 2734, from the hadeeth of Anas). He also said. “In your
      intercourse with your wife, there is reward.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah,
      can anyone of us have sexual enjoyment and be rewarded for that?” He said, “Do
      you not see that if you do that in a haraam manner, you will be punished for it? So if you
      do it in a halaal manner, you will be rewarded.” (As in the hadeeth of Abu
      Dharr, reported by Muslim, 1006).
      It is clear from the hadeeth that enjoying these worldly
      pleasures on the basis of praising Allaah, recognizing His bounty and seeking to protect
      oneself from doing forbidden things will bring reward from Allaah. Praise be to Allaah for
      His blessings. (See Majmoo’ al-Fawaa’id by Ibn Sa’di, p.
      234). Thus we know that in Islam there are permissible pleasures, having to
      do with eating and drinking permissible foods and enjoying permissible kinds of clothing
      and means of transportation, and there are pleasures for which a person will be rewarded
      in the Hereafter, in addition to his enjoyment of them in this world, such as the one who
      eats with the intention of gaining the strength to obey Allaah, or who sleeps with the
      intention of helping himself to get up to pray Qiyaam al-Layl and Fajr, or the one who has
      intercourse with his wife with the intention of keeping himself and her chaste, keeping
      them both away from sin, and with the hope of having a child, or the one who works hard at
      his trade or job with the intention of spending on himself and his family and his parents,
      and so on. And Allaah knows best."

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allaah) gives you! Truly, Allaah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer” [al-Nisaa’ 4:58]
“O you who believe! Betray not Allaah and His Messenger, nor betray knowingly your Amaanaat (things entrusted to you, and all the duties which Allaah has ordained for you)” [al-Anfaal 8:27]
In these aayaat there is the command to fulfil all kinds of trusts which people may be given. Fulfilling trusts and carrying them out properly is one of the greatest signs of faith.
 It was reported in al-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the munaafiq (hypocrite) are three: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise, he breaks it; and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 32; Muslim, no. 89). According to a report narrated by Muslim (no. 90), “Even if he fasts and prays and claims that he is a Muslim.”
 This indicates that betrayal is a characteristic of the hypocrites. In al-Musnad it was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no eemaan (faith) for the one who cannot be trusted and there is no religion for the one who does not keep his promise.” (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, no. 11935).
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray: “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-joo’i fa innahu bi’s al-dajee’, wa a’oodhi bika min al-khiyaanah fa innahaa bi’sat il-bitaanah (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from hunger, for it is the worst of bedfellows, and I seek refuge with You from betrayal, for it is the worst of companions).”
(Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, no. 5373; Abu Dawood, no. 1323; Ibn Maajah, 3345. Al-Albaani said, it is hasan saheeh. Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 3/1112).
Maymoon ibn Mihraan said: “Three things are to be fulfilled for the righteous and impious alike: trust, promises and the upholding of family ties.”
Hence it is obligatory for an employee to remember that his Lord is always watching and to fulfil the trust of his work honestly, sincerely and carefully, so that his conscience will be clear, his earnings will be good (halaal) and his Lord will be pleased with him.
What you have mentioned about fiddling (with medical expenses, etc.) is a form of cheating, deception and betrayal which is not appropriate. “A believer may have any (bad) qualities apart from treachery and lying.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, no. 21149, from the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Umaamah may Allaah be pleased with him).
So it is not permissible for you to manipulate the timings of your attendance at work, or to take sick leave when you are not sick, or to ask for things to which you are not entitled by giving false proof. All of that is haraam according to Islam, and is acting like the hypocrites. The fact that your boss or superior takes the matter lightly is not an acceptable excuse for doing something haraam. And Allaah knows best.
(3) With regard to neckties, please see Question # 1399
(4) With regard to praying wearing trousers or pants. If they are concealing and loose, not tight, then it is OK to pray in them. It is better to wear a shirt over them which covers the area from the navel to the knee and comes down to mid-calf or to the ankles, because that is more concealing.
(5)With regard to the beard, it is obligatory to leave it alone and let it grow, in obedience to the command of the Messenger of Allaah, and ignore what they say. Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it. And Allaah knows best."

      treating him well. Out of compassion and an attempt to the do right thing, he gave him his
      name and registered him as his own son in official documents. What is the ruling on this?",,"Praise be to Allah.According to shareeah it is not
    permissible for a person who adopts a child to give him his name as if he is his own son
    and a member of his tribe, as described in the question, because this involves lying,
    falsehood, the mixing of lineages and a threat to peoples honour, as well as
    distorting the channels of inheritance so that someone who is not entitled may receive an
    unfair share whilst depriving the rightful heirs of their due, and causing chaos in the
    sphere of relationships between mahram and non-mahram which affect issues of khulwah
    (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) and marriage. All of this violates
    sanctities and transgresses the bounds of shareeah. Hence Allaah forbade saying that
    a child belongs to anyone except his father or a slave belongs to anyone except his
    master. As Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons.
    That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allâh says the truth, and He guides to the
    (Right) Way. Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just
    with Allâh. But if you know not their fathers (names, call them) your brothers in
    Faith and Mawâlîkum (your freed slaves). And there is no sin on you concerning that in
    which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And
    Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Ahzaab 33:4-5]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said:
Whoever knowingly claims to belong to anyone other than
    his father, Paradise will be denied him. (Narrated by Ahmad, al-Bukhaari and

    claims to be the son of anyone other than his father, or the slave of anyone other than
    his master, on him will be the curse of Allaah continually until the Day of
    Resurrection. 
The one who is asking this question made a mistake when he
    tried to do the right thing by giving his name to the child. He cannot leave matters as
    they are; he has to try to change it and put matters right, because of the texts that
    state this naming is haraam, as quoted above. As for his feeling compassion for the child,
    bringing him up and treating him kindly, this is a good action which is encouraged in
    Islam. May Allaah bless our prophet Muhammad."

So how can you worship Allaah by following an abrogated religion? We advise you to read good Islamic books, and you will be guided to the truth, by the permission of Allaah. Do not be deceived by the large numbers of Christians around you, or by the fact that it is the religion of your forefathers, or by the influence of the media. You have a mind of your own, so use it and do not live according to what others think.
If you insist on remaining Christian, then in Islam it is permissible for a Muslim to marry a Christian woman, if she is chaste and does not engage in forbidden relationships. It is not permissible for him to live with her outside of marriage. If he does that, then he is a sinner who has disobeyed Allaah by committing a serious major sin, and he deserves punishment in this world and the next.
We ask Allaah to guide you and him, to make you strong and to grant you a good end. Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path."

At the edge of my land I found three graves – what should I do with them? Is it permissible for me to move the remains to another place?",,"Praise be to Allah.These people were originally buried in land for the dead (a graveyard), and they own it by virtue of being buried there. It is not permissible to disturb them, whether by digging up the remains, walking over the graves or any other form of disrespect. You should put up a fence around the graves so that they will not be subjected to any disrespect, and so as to preserve their dignity, because the sanctity of the dead among the Muslims is like the sanctity of the living. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions."

    Widow Abide By","Question

                What are the laws by which the widow
      whose husband had just died must abide by?",,"Praise be to Allah.The Hadith states what a mourning widow is prohibited 
  from doing and what she is requested to do.
First, she must remain in her house in which she 
  was living when her husband died. She remains therein until her iddah (mourning 
  period) comes to an end. This is four months and ten days. Unless she is pregnant, 
  wherein her mourning period ends when she gives birth. Allah says in the Quran,
""For those who are pregnant, their waiting period is until 
  they deliver"" (al-Talaq 4).
She does not leave the house except due to need 
  or necessity, such as visiting the hospital due to illness, buying what she 
  is in need of from the market, such as food or other items, if she cannot find 
  others to do such for her. Similarly, if the house is destroyed, she leaves 
  it for another house. Finally, if she does not find anyone who she knows close 
  to her and she fears for her safety, she may move due to that need.
Second, she may not wear any kind of beautiful 
  clothing, either yellow, green or other. She must wear clothing which is not 
  beautiful or attractive, regardless of whether it be black, green or otherwise. 
  The important aspect is that it is not beautiful or attractive. This is what 
  the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered. 
Third, she must not wear jewelry, either gold, 
  silver, diamonds, pearls or anything of that nature. This is regardless if it 
  be bracelets, chains or rings. She may not wear anything of this nature until 
  her mourning period is over. 
Fourth, she must refrain from using perfume. She 
  cannot perfume herself with either incense or any other kind of items that make 
  the body smell good. The only exception to this is when she cleanses herself 
  after her period. In that case, there is no harm if she applies some kind of 
  incense. 
Fifth, she should not apply kohl. She can neither 
  use kohl nor anything similar to kohl which is a beautification for the face, 
  a beautification that may be considered something that attracts people. As for 
  the normal beautification of using water and soap, there is nothing wrong with 
  that. But the kohl which is a beautification of the eyes and other similar items 
  that woman put on their faces are not to be used. 
These are the five items that a woman must attend 
  to when her husband dies. 
However, there are many other acts that the general 
  masses believe or have fabricated concerning a mourning woman. For example, 
  they say that she cannot talk to anyone, she may not talk on the phone, she 
  can only take a shower once a week, she cannot walk barefoot in her house, she 
  cannot go out under the light of the moon, and other superstitions that are 
  simply false. There is no basis for any of these. She may walk barefoot or with 
  shoes in her house. She fulfills her needs in the house, such as cooking her 
  food and the food of her guests. She may go out in the light of the moon on 
  her roof 1 or in her garden. She may wash herself whenever she wishes. She may 
  speak to anyone she wishes as long as it is not suspicious speech. She may shake 
  hands with women and men she is related to-- as for those men she is not related 
  to, she may not shake their hands. She may remove her head scarf if she is not 
  in the presence of men she is not related to.
However, she should not use henna or saffron either 
  on her clothing or in her coffee. This is because saffron is a kind of perfume 
  and it is not allowed for her to perfume herself. She cannot be proposed to. 
  One may indirectly make a statement intent to her but a clear proposal is not 
  allowed."
1212,4713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4713,"What is the meaning of the hadeeth “We are an unlettered nation, we do not write or calculate”?","Question

                What is the meaning of the hadeeth “We are an unlettered nation, we do not read or write”? Does this contradict what the Muslims are doing nowadays of seeking education?",,"Praise be to Allah.The wording of the hadeeth is not as mentioned 
          in the question. We will quote it here:
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) that the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “We are an unlettered 
          nation, we do not write or calculate. The month is such-and-such or 
          such-and-such – meaning sometimes it is twenty-nine and sometimes it 
          is thirty.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1814; Muslim, 1080)
This hadeeth was narrated concerning the issue of 
          the beginning of the lunar month, and it indicates that there is no 
          need to resort to astronomical calculations in order to know when the 
          month begins. We should rely on visual sighting of the moon when it 
          is new, then we will know that the month has begun. The hadeeth was 
          quoted to explain that we should rely on sighting of the moon and not 
          on calculations. It did not come to urge the ummah to remain ignorant 
          and not to learn arithmetic and all other useful sciences. So this hadeeth 
          does not contradict what Muslims are doing nowadays of seeking education 
          in different branches of science which will benefit their worldly interests. 
          Islam is the religion of knowledge; it calls for knowledge and obliges 
          every Muslim to learn what Allaah has enjoined upon him and to learn 
          whatever rulings of sharee’ah he needs to know about acts of worship 
          and dealings with others. With regard to worldly sciences such as medicine, 
          engineering, agriculture, etc., Muslims have to learn whatever the ummah 
          needs to know. If the Muslims need to manufacture a needle, there has 
          to be someone among them who can learn how to make this needle.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah wrote a very useful 
          discussion on this hadeeth; there follows a selection of his comments 
          on it:
“The phrase ‘We are an unlettered nation’ is not 
          telling them to be like that. They were unlettered before Islam came, 
          as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘He it is Who 
          sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves’ 
          
[al-Jumu’ah 62:2] 
          
‘And 
          say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and 
          to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): Do you (also) submit yourselves 
          (to Allaah in Islam)?’ 
[Aal ‘Imraan 
          3:20] 
Although this is how they were before the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) was sent to them, they were not commanded to become like 
          that. Some of the implications of being unlettered were to remain, but 
          as we shall see, they were not commanded to remain as they were in every 
          sense…
 Among the nation to which Allaah sent 
          him were some who could read and write a great deal, just as there were 
          among his Companions. There were also some who could calculate. The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) was sent with some obligations which involve calculation. 
          It was narrated that when the person he had appointed to take care of 
          the zakaah, Ibn al-Latabiyyah, came to him, he  calculated the 
          total amount collected. He had a number of scribes, such as Abu Bakr, 
          ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, ‘Ali, Zayd and Mu’aawiyah, who would write down the 
          Revelation, and would write contracts and write his letters to the people 
          to whom Allaah had sent him, the kings of the earth and the leaders 
          of groups, and to his workers, governors, etc. Allaah says in His Book 
          (interpretation of the meaning):
“… that you might 
          know the number of the years and the reckoning” 
[Yoonus 10:5; al-Israa’ 
          17:12] 
This is mentioned in two places in the Qur’aan, where 
          Allaah tells us that He has created [the sun and moon] so that the calculations 
          may be known.  
The word ummi 
          (unlettered or illiterate) comes from the same root as the word ummah 
          (nation). It refers to one who is not distinguished from the rest of 
          the people by knowing how to read or write. It is akin to the word ‘aammi 
          which is used to describe a regular person (one of the ‘aammah 
          or masses) who is not distinguished from them by having knowledge which 
          they do not have. It was also said that the word ummi 
          is connected to the word umm 
          (mother), because he has learned no more than his mother taught him, 
          and so on.  
The distinction which takes him out of the 
          ranks of the regular, unlettered people into the ranks of those who 
          have specialized knowledge may be a virtue in and of itself, as in the 
          case of those who read Qur’aan and understand its meaning, or it may 
          be a means which helps to reach that level of virtue, as when a person 
          is distinguished from them by his being able to write and read. So the 
          one who uses that knowledge to pursue perfection is to be praised, whilst 
          the one who neglects it or uses it for evil purposes is to be condemned. 
          Whoever does away with it in favour of something that is more beneficial 
          is more perfect, and if you can achieve the aim without using these 
          means, then that is even better.  
Thus it is clear that being distinct from 
          the unlettered is of two types. The first nation to which the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) was sent was the Arabs, through whom the Message was conveyed 
          to all the other nations, because it was sent in their tongue. They 
          were mostly illiterate, and they had no advantage of having knowledge 
          or a scripture etc., although by nature they were more ready to learn 
          than other nations. They were like a plowed field that is ready to be 
          sown, but there was no one to do the task and they had no scripture 
          they could read that had been revealed from Allaah, as the People of 
          the Book had, or any analytical science like the Sabaeans and others 
          had. Writing existed among them, but to a very small extent. They had 
          some knowledge of the type that is acquired by common sense, but which 
          does not make an individual distinct from any other unlettered person; 
          for example, they knew of the Creator, and they held good characteristics 
          in high esteem, and they had some knowledge of astronomy, genealogy 
          and poetry. So they deserved to be called unlettered in all senses of 
          the word, as Allaah said concerning them (interpretation of the meaning):
“‘He 
          it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from 
          among themselves’ 
[al-Jumu’ah 62:2] 
          
‘And 
          say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and 
          to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): Do you (also) submit yourselves 
          (to Allaah in Islam)?’ 
[Aal ‘Imraan 
          3:20] 
So the unlettered or illiterate were described as being 
          opposite to the People of the Book, for the kitaabi 
          (one of the People of the Book) is something other than the ummi 
          (unlettered).
 When he was sent among them, it became 
          obligatory upon them to follow the Book that he brought and to ponder 
          its meanings, understand it and act upon it. Allaah made this Book an 
          explanation for all things, and their Prophet taught them everything, 
          even (the etiquette of) defecation. They became people of a Book and 
          people of knowledge, indeed, they became the most knowledgeable of people 
          and the best of them in beneficial knowledge. They lost the feature 
          of blameworthy and imperfect illiteracy, which is the lack of knowledge 
          and a revealed Book, and they gained knowledge of the Book and wisdom. 
          They inherited the Book, as Allaah said concerning them (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
“He 
          it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from 
          among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from 
          the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book (this 
          Qur’aan, Islamic laws and Islamic jurisprudence) and Al-Hikmah 
          (As-Sunnah: legal ways, orders, acts of worship of Prophet Muhammad). 
          And verily, they had been before in manifest error” 
[al-Jumu’ah 62:2] 
            
They were unlettered in every sense of 
          the word, but when he taught then the Book and al-Hikmah, 
          Allaah said concerning them (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then 
          We gave the Book (the Qur’aan) as inheritance to such of Our slaves 
          whom We chose (the followers of Muhammad). Then of them are some who 
          wrong their ownselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, 
          and of them are some who are, by Allaah’s Leave, foremost in good deeds” 
          
[Faatir 35:32] 
“And this is 
          a blessed Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down, so follow it and 
          fear Allaah (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy 
          (i.e. saved from the torment of Hell). 
Lest you (pagan 
          Arabs) should say: ‘The Book was sent down only to two sects before 
          us (the Jews and the Christians), and for our part, we were in fact 
          unaware of what they studied.’ 
Or lest you (pagan 
          Arabs) should say: ‘If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would 
          surely, have been better guided than they (Jews and Christians).’” 
          
[al-An’aam 6:155-157] 
          
 And Allaah answered the prayer of al-Khaleel 
          (Ibraaheem) for them, when he said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Our 
          Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own (and indeed Allaah 
          answered their invocation by sending Muhammad), who shall recite unto 
          them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book (this Qur’aan) and Al-Hikmah 
          (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood) 
          
[al-Baqarah 2:129]
 So there are kinds of illiteracy which 
          are haraam, kinds which are makrooh and kinds which are a shortcoming 
          and failure to do that which is better. A person who does not know how 
          to read al-Faatihah or 
          any part of the Qur’aan, is called by the fuqahaa’ in their discussion 
          on al-salaah (prayer), ummi 
          (unlettered), the opposite of whom is a qaari’ 
          (one who reads or recites). They say: it is not correct for a qaari’ 
          to be led in prayer by an ummi, 
          but it is permissible for an ummi 
          to lead another ummi in 
          prayer; and they discuss other issues of the same nature. What they 
          mean by ummi here is one 
          who cannot read what is necessary, regardless of whether he can write 
          and calculate or not.
 This illiteracy also includes neglecting 
          what is obligatory, for which a man will be punished if he is able to 
          learn it but he does not do so.
 There is also the kind of illiteracy 
          which is blameworthy, such as that which Allaah described in the case 
          of the People of the Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
          there are among them (Jews) unlettered people, who know not the Book, 
          but they trust upon false desires and they but guess” 
[al-Baqarah 2:78]  
          
This is a description of one who does not 
          understand the word of Allaah or act upon it; all he does is to recite 
          it. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: The Qur’aan was revealed to be acted upon, 
          so recitation implies acting upon it. The ummi 
          in this sense may read the letters of the Qur’aan, etc., but he does 
          not understand it; when he speaks about matters of knowledge, he speaks 
          superficially, based on conjecture. This person is also regarded as 
          ummi and deserves to be 
          blamed, just as Allaah condemned him for his lack of obligatory knowledge, 
          whether this knowledge is fard ‘ayn 
          (obligatory on each individual) or fard 
          kafaayah (obligatory on the community as a whole but not 
          on each individual)
 There is also the kind of ‘illiteracy’ 
          which is better and more perfect, such as the one who only reads a part 
          of the Qur’aan and he only understands what he has learned. He only 
          understands as much of sharee’ah as he has to know. Such a person is 
          also called ummi (illiterate), 
          and others who learn and act upon the Qur’aan are better and more perfect 
          than him.
 These matters which distinguish a person 
          are virtues, and if a person fails to attain them, he is missing out 
          on something that is obligatory either on him as an individual (fard 
          ‘ayn) or is obligatory on the community (fard 
          kafaayah) or is mustahabb (recommended). These attributes of perfection and 
          virtue may be attributed to Allaah and His Prophets in general terms. 
          Allaah is All-Knowing and All-Wise, and He combines knowledge and beneficial 
          speech in all that He wants, tells and wills. The same is true of His 
          Prophets and our Prophet, the leader of the knowledgeable and wise.
 With regard to the distinguishing features 
          which are means to attaining virtues, but which one can do without and 
          use alternative means, these are things like writing and numeracy. If 
          a person does not have these abilities, knowing that virtue cannot be 
          achieved without them, not having them is a sign of imperfection. If 
          a person acquires them and uses them to perfect himself – like the one 
          who learns how to read and then uses that to read the Qur’aan and read 
          useful books or write other things that will be of benefit to people 
          – then this is a virtue in his case. But if he uses it for purposes 
          that will harm him or other people – like the one who reads misguided 
          books or writes things that will harm people, like forging the writing 
          of rulers, judges and witnesses – then this will be bad for him, and 
          will be a sin and imperfection. Hence ‘Umar forbade teaching women how 
          to write. If it is possible to do without it yet still achieve perfect 
          knowledge, then this is better, and this was the case with our Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him), of whom Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those 
          who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write 
          (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) 
          and the Injeel (Gospel)…” 
[al-A’raaf 7:157] 
          
His being unlettered did not mean that he was lacking 
          in knowledge or the ability to recite by heart, for he is the leader 
          of all imaams in that regard. What it meant was that he was not able 
          to write or to read anything that was written, as Allaah said of him 
          (interpretation of the meaning):
“Neither 
          did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’aan), nor did 
          you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand…” 
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:48] 
          
 [Then he (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah 
          have mercy on him) went back to discussing the hadeeth “We are an unlettered 
          nation, we do not write or calculate…” and stated that there is a corroborating 
          report which refers to what is meant by this hadeeth. Then he said:]
 When this is compared with his comment 
          that the month may be thirty or twenty-nine days, it becomes clear that 
          what is meant is that with regard to the new moon (beginning of the 
          month), we have no need for writing or calculations, because sometimes 
          it is (thirty days) and sometimes it is (twenty-nine days). What differentiates 
          between them is the sighting (of the new moon), there is nothing else 
          that differentiates between them, such as writing or calculation.
Thus is becomes clear that the “illiteracy” 
          mentioned here is a characteristic which is praiseworthy in several 
          senses:
it 
          means doing without writing and calculations in favour of something 
          whichis clearer and more apparent, namely, (sighting) the new moon.
-Writing and calculation may involve errors…

                I have been studing Islam for a few months now, I have a Quran and am busy reading it and I must admit I am comparing it with the bible. I am almost ready to embrace Islam however I have two major problems. First I am married to a Christian, he drinks a lot and is out of work at this stage, when he drinks I become someone I do not like very much. I do not drink at all and have not for several years. My father was an alcoholic and unfortunately I also married one.
I loved him very much when we got married however he has slowly destroyed this love with his manners and attitude. I do like him, when he is sober he is the kindest and most giving person I know and he would do almost anything for his friends and I think for his family. We have 2 children but they are both very fed up with his drinking. If I had to leave him, he will most definitely land up in the gutter. He will not be able to cope on his own. He has a very low self-esteem at this stage. I am very helpless at this stage and do not know what to do.
My second major problem is I am friends with a much younger Muslim man. We have known each other for a couple of years now and I have also come to love him. The major problem here is he is married and has two children, he is much younger than what I am and he is friends with my husband and I am friends with his wife. I have never indicated to him how I feel or what I feel, but I do dream a lot of what may be. I know this is probably wrong. I am not the type of person who will leave my husband for another man but we have not had a proper marriage relationship for almost six years now and I am not dead yet.
I would like to embrace Islam but I am afraid that my friend's attitude may change towards me when I become a Muslimah, we now visit and talk about almost anything ranging from business to religion and I would not like to loose his friendship by committing myself. My friend is a is very staunch in his religion and he is a practising Muslim.",,"Praise be to Allah.The conviction that you have reached must be very firm and strong, because it is based on research and study, and comes after you have compared the Bible and the Quran. We do not think that that you need to be convinced any further, but the problems that you talk about have to do with the next step, which is really embracing the religion of Islam and starting to practise it by living an Islamic life. We do not see any real obstacles that would prevent you from taking this step. Let us look at each of these problems in turn.
The first problem is: how will your alcoholic husband react to your becoming Muslim? The Islamic ruling is that as soon as you embrace Islam, you start your iddah, which is the waiting period (following dissolution of a marriage).
Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: According to our opinion, if a woman becomes Muslim when her husband is a kaafir, then he becomes Muslim, then he has more right (to go back) to her as long as she is still in her iddah period, but if her iddah has expired, he has no right to go back to her.
Al-Shaafai said: If one of them (the couple) becomes Muslim before the marriage is consummated, then their separation takes effect instantly when one of them becomes Muslim. If this happens after the marriage has been consummated, then it becomes the matter of waiting until three (menstrual periods) have passed. This is if the woman has regular periods; otherwise the waiting period is three months. If the other partner becomes Muslim before this time has passed, then their marriage contract remains valid.
(Tabyeen al-Haqaaiq Sharh Kanz al-Daqaaiq, part 2, Baab Nikaah al-Kaafir).
This is because a Muslim woman is not allowed to be married to a kaafir at all, because Islam should prevail and not be prevailed over.
So become Muslim, and present Islam to him (your husband). If he becomes Muslim too, then praise be to Allaah. Maybe this will make him give up alcohol. If he does not become Muslim and the iddah time expires, then leave him, especially as his circumstances are not acceptable and and his alcoholism is causing so much trouble for you and your children, and living with him is unbearable. Do not feel any regrets about him; maybe Allaah will compensate you with someone better than him. If he cannot take care of himself, then he only has himself to blame, because he is bringing it upon himself. If you leave him, this make him feel bad and thus bring him back to his senses; maybe then he will become Muslim and get his wife and children back.
The second problem is very serious and dangerous, because it has to do with an Islamically unacceptable relationship between a man and a non-mahram woman who talk together intimately about all kinds of topics, without any controls or restraints. This improper conduct has led to other kinds of improper conduct, namely love and attachment and fear of separation from that person, as well as the weighing up of this relationship against the religion of Islam even though continuing this intimate relationship is so harmful and entering Islam is obligatory and will bring happiness in this world and salvation from the Fire in the Hereafter. Moreover, we are astonished and wonder how he can be so committed to his religion as you say yet he has formed such a relationship with you that you describe him as your friend. You must hasten to enter Islam and advise this person in an appropriate fashion (such as sending him an e-mail, for example). Rest assured that when you become Muslim, Allaah will make for you a way to get out (from difficulty), and He will provide for you from (sources) you could never imagine. So strive to please your Lord, and He will be pleased with you and will make other people pleased with you. May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him."

1215,4804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4804,Should he send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he makes du’aa’ in his sujood?,"Question

                I know that one of the requisites of making Du'a is sending prayers on the Prophet Muhammad (S) and the Du'a is blocked from the heavens until one sends prayers on him (S). Is this is general ruling? What is one wants of make Du'a during sujood (prostration), does one send prayers on the Prophet during that posture as well?",,"Praise be to Allah.According to Islamic teaching, du’aa’ (supplication) 
          may be divided into two categories, general and specific.
 General du’aa’ is that which may be 
          initiated by the individual, in which he may say whatever he wants, 
          at certain times or in certain places prescribed by sharee’ah, such 
          as making du’aa’ in the last third of the night, or making du’aa’ between 
          the adhaan (call to prayer) and iqaamah (second call immediately preceding 
          the prayer), or making du’aa’ at ‘Arafaah, and so on.
 The specific kind of du’aa’ is du’aa’s 
          which are said when entering or leaving a place, when certain things 
          happen, and so on, such as when entering and leaving the toilet, when 
          the wind blows strongly, and so on.
 The first kind, general du’aa’s, are 
          those in which blessings should be sent upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They should also include 
          praise of Allaah. Faddaalah ibn ‘Ubayd said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) heard a man making du’aa’ in his prayer, but he did not 
          praise Allaah or send blessings on the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: ‘This man is in a hurry.’ Then he called him or someone 
          else and said, ‘When any one of you prays, let him begin by praising 
          his Lord, then let him send blessings on the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then let him pray for whatever 
          he wants after that.’”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3477, and Abu Dawood, 1481)  
          
The context of sending blessings on the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) was mentioned by the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him), who said:
“Blessings should be sent upon him before supplication 
          and after praising Allaah.
The second place is to send blessings upon him at the 
          beginning of the du’aa’, in the middle and at the end.
The third place is to send blessings upon him at the 
          beginning and at the end, and to mention one’s need in the middle.”
(Jalaa’ al-Afhaam, 
          p. 375)  
With regard to the reason for sending blessing 
          upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) in du’aa’, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may 
          Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“Sending blessings upon him is one of the greatest means 
          of having du’aa’s answered, and this has been enjoined by Allaah. Sending 
          blessings upon him in du’aa’ is what is indicated by the Qur’aan, Sunnah 
          and ijmaa’ (scholarly consensus). Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning);
‘Allaah 
          sends His Salaah (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy) on the Prophet 
          (Muhammad), and also His angels (ask Allaah to bless and forgive him). 
          O you who believe! Send your Salaah on (ask Allaah to bless) him (Muhammad), 
          and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting 
          (salutation, i.e. As‑Salaamu ‘Alaikum)’ 
[al-Ahzaab 33:56].”
(Majmoo al-Fataawa, 
          1/347) 
 Ibn al-Qayyim said:
In these contexts in which it is prescribed to send blessing 
          upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him), it is prescribed to send blessings upon the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) before starting the du’aa’. The key to du’aa’ is 
          sending blessings upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), just as the key to salaah 
          (prayer) is purity. So may Allaah send blessings and peace upon him 
          and his family.  
With regard to the specific kind of du’aa’s mentioned 
          above, these do not include sending blessings upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), except in a few cases such 
          as the du’aa’ for entering the mosque and the du’aa’ after the adhaan, 
          as will be quoted below.  
The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his ummah 
          specific du’aa’s for certain times and certain actions, in which there 
          is no sending blessings on the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). These include:
Du’aa’ 
          al-istikhaarah:
 It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah 
          (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) taught us to pray for guidance in all our affairs, just 
          as he would teach us a soorah from the Qur’aan. He said: “If any of 
          you intends to undertake a matter, then let him pray two non-obligatory 
          rak’ahs, then let him say:
‘Allaahumma inni astakheeruka 
          bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika, wa as’aluka min fadlik al-‘azeem 
          fa innaka taqdiru wa laa aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa laa a’lam, wa anta ‘allaam 
          ul-ghuyoobi. Allaahumma in kunta ta’lamu anna haadha’l-amra 
          – and here he mentions his need – khayrun 
          li fi deeni wa ma’aashi wa ‘aaqibati amri (or he said, ‘aajil amri wa aajilihi), faqdirhu 
          li wa yassirhu li thumma baarik li fihi. Wa in kunta ta’lam anna hadha’l-amra 
          sharrun li fi deeni wa ma’aashi wa ‘aaqbiti amri (or he said, 
          ‘aajil amri wa aajilihi), 
          fasrifhu ‘anni wasrifni ‘anhu waqdir 
          li al-khayr haythu kaana thumma ardini bihi
(O Allaah, 
          I seek Your guidance by Your knowledge and I seek strength by Your power. 
          I ask you of Your great Bounty. You have power, I have none, You know, 
          I know not. You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allaah, if You know 
          that this matter – and here he should mention it – is good for me in 
          my religious commitment, my livelihood and my affairs (or he said, immediately 
          and in the distant future), then decree it for me, make it easy for 
          me and bless it for me. And if you know that this matter is bad for 
          me in my religious commitment, my livelihood and my affairs (or he said, 
          immediately and in the distant future), then turn it away from me, and 
          turn me away from it, and decree for me whatever is good, wherever it 
          may be, and make me content with it).’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1113) Du’aa’ when entering 
          the toilet:
 It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik 
          (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Whenever he entered the toilet, 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) used to say, ‘Allaahumma 
          inni a’oodhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaa’ith (O Allaah, 
          I seek refuge with You from all evil and evildoers).”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5963; Muslim, 375) 
Du’aa’ when there are high winds:
 It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah, the 
          wife of the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whenever there was a wind-storm, 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) would say, “Allaahumma 
          inni as’aluka khayrahaa wa khayra ma fihaa wa khayra maa ursilat bihi, 
          wa a’oodhu bika min sharrihaa wa sharri maa fihaa wa sharri ma ursilat 
          bihi (O Allaah, I ask You for its goodness, the goodness 
          within it and the good with which it was sent, and I seek refuge with 
          You from its evil, the evil within it and the evil with which it was 
          sent.”
 And there are other du’aa’s which he 
          taught us, in which there is no mention of sending blessings upon him, 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him). We should recite them as he has taught them to us, without 
          adding anything or taking anything away. This ruling also applies to 
          making du’aa’ in sujood, which is mentioned in the question. Several 
          du’aa’s have been reported that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his sujood, none 
          of which contain blessings upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). These du’aa’s include the 
          following:
 It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may 
          Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often used to say in his 
          sujood and rukoo’: ‘Subhaanaka Allaahumma 
          Rabbanaa wa bi hamdika, Allaahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise 
          be to You, O Allaah our Lord; O Allaah, forgive me).’” (Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, 874; Muslim, 484). 
And it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “one 
          night I noticed that the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not in his bed, so I 
          reached out looking for him, and my hand touched the soles of his feet; 
          he was in his prayer place and his feet were upright (i.e., he was prostrating), 
          and he was saying, ‘Allaahumma a’oodhu 
          bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika wa a’oodhi 
          bika minka laa uhsi thanaa’an ‘alayka anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsika 
          (O Allaah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and 
          I seek refuge in Your pardon from Your punishment. I seek refuge in 
          You from You. I cannot enumerate Your praise, You are as You have praised 
          Yourself).’”
(Narrated by Muslim, 486) 
Let us not forget also that the person who 
          is praying will recite al-salaah 
          al-Ibraaheemiyyah when he sits to recite the Tashahhud in 
          his prayer; thus his prayer will include sending blessings upon the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him).
The specific du’aa’s which include sending 
          blessings upon the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) include the following:
-Du’aa’ when entering the mosque:
It was narrated that Abu Humayd and Abu Usayd 
          said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters 
          the mosque, let him greet the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with peace, then let him 
          say, ‘Allaahumma aftah li abwaab rahmatika (O Allaah, open to me 
          the gates of Your Mercy).’ And when he leaves, let him say, ‘Allaahumma 
          inni as’aluka min fadlika (O Allaah, I ask You of Your Bounty).’”
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 466). 
(This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Tamaam 
          al-Minnah, p. 290) 
Du’aa’ 
          following the adhaan:
 It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn’Amr 
          ibn al-‘Aas heard the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin, 
          say what he says, then send blessings upon me, for whoever sends blessings 
          upon me, Allaah will send ten blessings upon him. Then ask Allaah to 
          grant me al-waseelah, 
          which is a position in Paradise which will only be attained by one of 
          the slaves of Allaah, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks 
          for al-waseelah for me, 
          my intercession will be granted for him.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 384)

1217,4811,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4811,So let man see from what he is created,"Question

                Did Allaah create man from clay or from something else that is not fully described in the Qur’aan?",,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Allaah created Adam (peace be upon him) from the earth i.e., 
    from what it contains. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Thereof (the earth) We created you, and into it We shall 
    return you, and from it We shall bring you out once again”

    [Ta-Ha 20:55]

    He created him from the dust of the earth, as He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is 
    the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust…”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]

    There are many similar verses in the Qur’aan. 

    Then the dust was combined with water to form clay, as the 
    Lord of the Worlds says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “He it is Who has created you from clay, and then has 
    decreed a (stated) term (for you to die). And there is with Him another 
    determined term (for you to be resurrected)”

    [al-An’aam 6:2]

    There are also many similar verses. 

    This clay was sticky – or it was said, viscous – as it says 
    in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, We created them of a sticky clay”

    [al-Saaffaat 37:11]
Ibn Manzoor said: the words laazib (sticky) comes 
    from the root lazuba which has the meaning of becoming sticky and solid.  

    Lisaan al-‘Arab, 1/738 

    Then this sticky clay became muntin (stinking). Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of 
    altered mud [min hama’in masnoon]”

    [al-Hijr 15:26]

    Al-Raazi said:

    Al-hama’ means black mud. 
    

    (Mukhtaar al-Sihaah, p. 64). 

    It says in Lisaan al-‘Arab (1/61):

    Al-hama’ means black, stinking 
    mud. In the Qur’aan it says “min hama’in masnoon.” 

    And it says in Lisaan al-‘Arab (13/227): 

    “Masnoon means muntin (stinking), as in the 
    verse ‘min hamaa’in masnoon.’ Abu ‘Amr said: this means altered and 
    stinking. Abu’l-Haytham said: sunna al-ma’, fa huwa masnoon, i.e., 
    the water changed, so it was altered (masnoon).” 

    When this mud was mixed with sand, it became salsaal 
    (dried clay). 

    Al-Raazi said: 

    Salsaal is hot mud mixed with 
    sand, so it starts to clank or clatter when it dries. If it is baked with 
    fire it becomes fired clay or earthenware pottery. 

    Mukhtaar al-Sihaah, 1/154. 

    It says in Lisaan al-‘Arab (11/382): 

    Al-Salsaal min al-teen (clay 
    made from mud) is that which has not been made into pottery. Any mud or clay 
    that dries is described as salla saleelan (rattling or clattering) … 
    i.e., it makes a noise like new pottery. Thus salsaal is likened to 
    pottery, as in the verse,  

    “He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of 
    pottery”

    [al-Rahmaan 55:14 – interpretation of the meaning]

    All of this is confirmed by the hadeeth of Abu Moosa 
    al-Ash’ari who said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘Allaah created Adam from a handful 
    that He gathered from the entire earth, so the sons of Adam come like the 
    earth. Some of them are red, some are white, some are black and some are in 
    between. Some of them are easy, some of them are difficult, some are evil 
    and some are good.”

    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2955; Abu Dawood, 4693. Al-Tirmidhi 
    said that this hadeeth is hasan saheeh, and it was classed as saheeh by Ibn 
    Hibbaan, 14/29; al-Haakim, 2/288; and al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 
    3926). 

    This is how Adam was created: from the earth – i.e. from its 
    dust – which was then mixed with water to form mud, which then became black, 
    stinking mud. And this dust was created from the earth which is partly sand 
    and when it is mixed it becomes sounding clay like the clay of pottery. 

    Hence when Allaah describes the creation of Adam in the 
    Qur’aan, in each case He describes one of the stages through which his 
    creation passed and through which the mud was formed. So there is no 
    contradiction in the verses of the Qur’aan. 

    Then after that the sons of Adam started to multiply and they 
    were created through water which is the sperm and fluids which are emitted 
    by men and women, as is well known. 

    This is explained by the Qur’aan in the verses 
    (interpretation of the meanings): 

    “And it is He Who has created man from water, and has 
    appointed for him kindred by blood, and kindred by marriage”

    [al-Furqaan 25:54]

    “Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water 
    (male and female sexual discharge)”

    [al-Sajdah 32:8]

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    When the perfection, complete power, all-encompassing 
    knowledge, ever-executed will and utmost wisdom of the Lord decreed that His 
    creation should be of materials of different kinds, and that they should 
    vary in their forms and attributes and natures, His wisdom decreed that He 
    should take a handful of dust from the earth, then mix it with water. So it 
    became like black stinking mud. Then the wind was sent upon it and it dried 
    out, until it became clay like pottery. Then it was given shape and limbs 
    and faculties, and each part of it was given a shape suited to its purpose.

     Then he mentioned how people are created by means of 
    intercourse and the emission of semen.

    become Muslim but thinks she will have problems with her friends, family and job","Question

                I am a woman studying Islam and have a few
      questions that need answering:
      1. I have a few Muslim male friends, we are very close and they treat me as an equal, if I
      had to convert to Islam would their attitutes towards me have to change, e.g. when I visit
      their houses, their wifes are very much in the background while I am allowed to sit with
      the men and partake in the conversation the wifes are usually busy in the kitchens or else
      busy with the kids or generally sit and watch TV while we talk; I would not like to loose
      these special moments with my friends;
      2. What will I be able to do about Friday prayers? I work in a place where my situation is
      very difficult. My collegeus are very prejudice against Muslims and I am afraid that
      should I convert they will freak. I have read somewhere that you can appoint someone to do
      the prayers for you, is that true?
      3. My family are all very staunch Christians and I was brought up as a christian, I am
      also married to a christian but he has no objections to my studying and practicing Islam,
      if I had to convert how can I get my family to leave me alone?
      4. Obviously this is a big step for me and I do still have doubts as to whether I am doing
      the right thing, how can one be 100% sure that you are doing the right thing. In my heart
      I feel OK about this although my mind has a lot of worries as you can notice from my
      questions. I am sure of the Oneness of God and have always been. I have read the Choice by
      Ahmed Deedat and I am sure about the Prophet (PBUH) and I do and have always believed in
      life after death but why do I still feel so confused? Am I ready to take the big step?",,"Praise be to Allah.Is what you want to do the right step? Are you ready to take 
  this great step? From what you say, these are the two important questions to 
  which you have been trying to find the answer. We thank you for consulting us, 
  and we believe that what you are going to do is the right step for sure, because 
  this is the religion of Allaah, and He does not accept any other religion from 
  His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will 
  never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
Maybe you have compared (religions, etc.) and read widely and 
  have reached the conviction that this is the true religion which you must follow, 
  but this is not enough and it will not save a person just to believe in the 
  Oneness of Allaah and the Prophethood of Muhammad  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the resurrection after death. 
  He must also utter the Shahadataayn and practise Islam. It seems to us that 
  your hesitation is not due to lack of conviction of the truth but because of 
  certain fears that have to do with social factors such as friends, family, husband 
  and job.
One aspect of the answer may be found under Question # 4775, 
  so please refer to that. As far as your Muslim acquaintances are concerned, 
  you will be sitting with their wives, not with the men, as is dictated by Islamic 
  teaching. If you find this difficult at first, you will find it easy later on. 
  If these women are too busy, then look for other sincere Muslim women who you 
  can make friends with and encourage one another to adhere to the truth.
If you are sincere towards Allaah, He will help 
  you to overcome your difficulties with your husband and family. With regard 
  to Friday Prayers, this is not obligatory for women because the Prophet of Islam 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
  “It is a duty for every Muslim to pray Jumu’ah in congregation apart 
  from four: slaves, women, young boys and the sick.” (Reported by 
  Abu Dawood, 901). Women have to pray four rak’ahs of Zuhr 
  prayer on Friday wherever they are. What you have heard about a person delegating 
  someone else to pray on his behalf is not correct at all. Prayer is fard 
  ‘ayn, i.e., an individual duty for each Muslim, and it is not acceptable 
  for one person to appoint someone else as a proxy or for one person to pray 
  on behalf of another. In any case, you have no need for this in the case of 
  Jumu’ah prayers, as you now know.
Briefly, all you need in your case is to put your trust in 
  Allaah and strive to please Him. Go ahead and embrace His religion even if it 
  makes other people angry. So long as you accept Him as your Lord and God, and 
  follow His religion, He will never let you down or forsake you. We believe that 
  you are ready to take this great step, in sha Allaah, so remember our advice 
  in brief is “Go for it” and put your trust in Allaah. We ask Allaah 
  to give you strength."

regarding the selling of our Masjid property.Alhamdulillaah, a few years ago we purchased a property and converted it into a Masjid. Things are going quite well there. Now we have seen another property and many brothers feel that it is a better location and so on. Would it be permissible for us in such a case to sell the present Masjid so that we could buy the second property which
we prefer?",,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih

“Praise be to Allaah. Yes, this is permissible, but on the
    condition that the (Muslim) neighbours agree. If the Muslim neighbours of the mosque who
    pray there agree, then there is nothing wrong with it, because the other mosque may be far
    away from them, and this mosque is freehold.”
Question:
If the Muslims in that city are scattered and live far away from one
    another, whose opinion should count?
Answer:
“They should heed the opinion of those among them who live near
    the mosque, so that the mosque will not be so far away from them that it becomes difficult
    for them to attend.
Question:
If the other mosque or new mosque will benefit a greater number of
    Muslims, what should they do?
Answer:
“I think that they should leave the old mosque as it is and build
    another, new mosque in the other place. If they cannot build the other mosque because they
    have little money, I think they should leave the old mosque as it is so that its

                We Muslims who live in foreign countries
    are faced with the problem of linguistic assimilation, whereby we speak the language of
    the Kuffaar in the west in a conscious or unconscious effort to get along with the people
    around us, and because we are influenced by the environment we are in. What is the Islamic
    view of this problem, and how can we overcome it?",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Islam Ahmad ibn ‘Abd al-Haleem ibn
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) spoke very effectively about this problem,
    explaining its seriousness and effects, and the Islamic viewpoint concerning it. This is
    what he said:
“As for becoming accustomed to talking to one another in a
    language other than Arabic, which is the symbol of Islam and the language of the
    Qur’aan, so that this becomes a habit in the land, with one’s family and
    household members, with one’s friends, in the marketplace, when addressing government
    representatives or authority figures or when speaking to people of knowledge, undoubtedly
    this is makrooh (disliked), because it involves being like the non-Arabs, which is
    makrooh, as stated previously.
Hence when the early Muslims went to live in Syria and Egypt, where the
    people spoke Byzantine Greek, and in Iraq and Khurasaan, where the people spoke Farsi, and
    the Maghrib (North Africa) where the people spoke Berber, they taught the people of those
    countries to speak Arabic, so that Arabic became the prevalent language in those lands,
    and all the people, Muslim and kaafir alike, spoke Arabic. Such was also the case in
    Khurasaan in the past, then they became lax with regard to the language and got used to
    speaking Farsi until it became prevalent and Arabic was forgotten by most of them.
    Undoubtedly this is makrooh.
The best way is to become accustomed to speaking Arabic so that the
    young people will learn it in their homes and schools, so that the symbol of Islam and its
    people will prevail. This will make it easier for the people of Islam to understand the
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the words of the Salaf, unlike a person who gets used to
    speaking one language, then wants to learn another, and finds it difficult.
Know that being used to using a language has a clear and strong effect
    on one’s thinking, behaviour and religious commitment. It also has an effect on
    making one resemble the early generations of this Ummah, the Sahaabah and Taabi’een.
    Being like them improves one’s thinking, religious commitment and behaviour.
Moreover, the Arabic language itself is part of Islam, and knowing
    Arabic is an obligatory duty. If it is a duty to understand the Qur’aan and Sunnah,
    and they cannot be understood without knowing Arabic, then the means that is needed to
    fulfil the duty is also obligatory.
There are things which are obligatory on all individuals (fard
    ‘ayn), and others which are obligatory on the community or ummah (fard kifaayah,
    i.e., if some people fulfil them the rest are relieved of the obligation).
This is the meaning of the report narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah
    who said: ‘Eesa ibn Yoonus told us from Thawr from ‘Umar ibn Yazeed that
    ‘Umar wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said:
    ‘learn the Sunnah and learn Arabic; learn the Qur’aan in Arabic for it is
    Arabic.’
According to another hadeeth narrated from ‘Umar (may Allaah be
    pleased with him), he said: ‘Learn Arabic for it is part of your religion, and learn
    how the estate of the deceased should be divided (faraa’id) for these are part
    of your religion.’
This command of ‘Umar, to learn Arabic and Sharee’ah,
    combines the things that are needed, for religion involves understanding words and
    actions. Understanding Arabic is the way to understand the words of Islam, and
    understanding the Sunnah is the way to understand the actions of Islam…”
(Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 2/207)
In addition to the above, we advise the following:
Muslims should strive – along with their families and children
        – to speak Arabic in their homes and gatherings. Parents should set the example for
        their children within the home, and sometimes they should deliberately not answer their
        children if they do not speak Arabic.

Try to put the children in Arabic schools and academies wherever
        possible.

Families should try to form housing co-ops or live close to one another,
        so that the neighbourhood and the local environment will be Arabic-speaking.

Try to set up Arabic-language courses and seek reward and draw closer to
        Allaah by doing so. Books, tapes and other modern educational means should be used for
        this purpose.

Continually listening to recordings of the Qur’aan, listening to
        lessons on tape and attending Islamic lectures in Arabic.

We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, who answered as follows:

The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas said:
“In the cases where a menstruating woman is permitted to recite the Quran, she is also permitted to do Sujud At-Tilawah , if she happens to recite or hear a verse where the Sajdah is prescribed. 
The correct view is that it is permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the Quran from memory, not from the Mus-haf (Quran hard copy). So on this basis, the Sujud is prescribed for her , because it is not prayer, rather it is an act of submission to Allah and worship, like other kinds of Dhikr.
Is Wudu necessary for Sujudt At-Tilawah?
The correct view is that (Wudu) it is not a condition for Sujud Ash-Shukr and Sujud At-Tilawah. It is not mandatory for the one who is reciting or listening to be in a state of ritual purity , because they do not come under the rulings of prayer.

                I have three sons and a daughter. My husband, may Allah protect us, is
an alcoholic. He has be imprisoned in the past. He is addicted to alcohol and has injured me and my children. I have been divorced from him and I am currently with my family. He does not spend anything on us and
      I do not have any desire to return to him. However, he has threatened to take my children and that would be something that I could not bear. After
      all, I am, first and foremost, a mother. Please help me.",,"Praise be to Allah.This is something that definitely needs to be taken up in the courts of
    law. One should not remain with an alcoholic as he harms his wife and his children. One
    should remain away from him unless Allah guides him and he returns to what is correct. If
    the judge separates the two, usually, the children are given over to the mother as she is
    most qualified for them while he is not qualified. As long as he has the problem of being
    an alcoholic, he is not suited to bring up his children as he will destroy and ruin them.
    Therefore, she has more right to her children than him, even if they be boys. This is what
    is usually done by the judges and this is what is obligatory. The children must be with
    her because she is better than him and he is an evildoer. If she refuses to go back to
    him, she has done well, as such a living condition is harmful and dangerous for her. If he
    also does not pray, then it is obligatory not to return to him for the one who abandons
    the prayer is a disbeliever-- and protection is sought from Allah. The Prophet (peace be
    upon him) said, ""The covenant between us and them is the prayer. Whoever abandons it
    has committed disbelief.""l
    It is not obligatory to remain with the one who does not pray.2
    ""They are not lawful [wives] for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful
    [husbands] for them"" (al-Mumtahina 10).
    [That is,] until Allah guides them and they repent. The woman should go to her family or
    stay with her children and not let her husband come to them until he repents to Allah and
    returns to what is right.If he prays but drinks alcohol, then that is a great sin and
    great crime. 
    However, he is not a disbeliever but an evildoer.The woman has the right to prevent him
    from her and to leave him. She is excused for that act. If she remains patient and has the
    ability to be patient, there is no harm in that option either.

      So, please tell me what should i tell him. What should he do, next? Should he give divorce
      to her or forget about her past? What does islam says about this situation? Thank you,",,"Praise be to Allah.If this woman has mended her ways and has repented to
    Allaah and has given up haraam things and going out with men, and there are no reasons to
    be suspicious about her, then our advice is that your friend should keep her and conceal
    her past mistakes. Whoever conceals a Muslims faults, Allaah will conceal his faults
    in this world and the next. Allaah is Forgiving and Merciful, He forgives and accepts the
    repentance of the one who turns to Him in repentance. So we should be forgiving and should
    treat the one who has repented in accordance with the way he is now, and help him to
    continue to repent. The one who has repented is like one who has never sinned at all. If
    the husband conceals his wifes past mistakes and treats her well, this will be of
    immense benefit in helping this woman adhere to the straight path and encouraging her to
    continue living a life of purity and chastity; her husband will also have a great reward
    for concealing her faults, keeping her chaste and helping her to avoid evil and stay on
    the straight path, living under his care in a pure atmosphere in the marital home.
If this woman is still persisting in mischief and going out with men
    and committing haraam actions, and does not repent despite being advised to do so, then we
    do not suggest that he should keep her at all. Let him get rid of her and Allaah will
    provide him with another wife.
If she has repented, but he cannot bear what she has done in the past,
    and he is tormented with bad thoughts that give him sleepless nights, and he is scared
    that if he keeps her he may mistreat her even though she has repented, then he can divorce
    her so as to give himself peace of mind and avoid mistreating her. But he should look at
    the matter anew and think long and hard about the advice we have given here. Let him think
    about himself too: maybe he has made mistakes in the past, or will do so in the future. We
    ask Allaah to help him to make the right decision and to guide him to the best way. Allaah
    is the Source of strength and the Guide to the Straight Path."

Should a person who is reading Quran say Takbeer when doing sajdat al-tilaawah and when sitting up, or only when going down? Should he recite the Tashahhud or not? Should he say salaam afterwards or not?",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the person who is doing sajdat al-tilaawah should say Takbeer when going down, because of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Quran to us, and if he reached a verse where a sajdah was prescribed, he would say Takbeer and prostrate and we would do likewise.”
(Reported by Ahmad, 2/17; al-Bukhaari, 2/33,34; Muslim, 1/405, no. 575). He should not say Takbeer when coming up from the sujood, because there is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that, and because sajdat al-tilaawah is an act of worship, and acts of worship are to be done in accordance with what is prescribed in sharee’ah. What was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Takbeer when going down into sujood al-tilaawah, not when coming up. But if a person is doing sajdat al-tilaawah when praying, then he should say takbeer both when going down and when coming up, because of the general meaning of the saheeh ahaadeeth which describe the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and state that he said Takbeer each time he went down into sujood or came up.
Secondly: one should not recite al-Tashahhud or say salaam after doing sajdat al-tilaawah, because there is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that. Sajdat al-tilaawah is an act of worship and as such should be done as prescribed as in sharee’ah and we cannot make qiyaas (analogy) comparing it to the tashahhud and salaam in prayer.

What is the ruling concerning joking? Is it considered useless and vain speech? Note that it does not contain any ridiculing of the religion.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no harm in joking by words and anecdotes, if they are truthful and real, especially if it is not done often. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to joke but he would only speak the truth. If it is with lying, then it is not allowed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ""Woe to the one who speaks and tells a lie in order to make the people laugh at it. Woe to him. Then again, woe to him.""

What should a woman do if she is reciting Qur’aan and comes across an aayah where a sajdah is prescribed?

                If a family member dies overseas, what should the family do overhere? 
1. can we perform the janaza prayer, that means there will be two janaza prayers, one overseas and one here. Is it allowed?  
2.  Are we allowed to read the quran together and hopefully the blessing will go to the deceased? 
3. Do we have to do a special Quran reading and invite people for a meal after three days and after 40 days also? This is being practiced back home and I am told that the spirit of the deceased  comes to the house for 40 days and wait to get all these blessings. 
When I was back home I used to practice this but now I am told that the Prophet sws and His companions never did it. I want to do the right thing. Please give quotations from quran and sunnah. And also if this practice is wrong, please advise what is the proper thing to do under this circumstance.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: if a relative or close friend dies 
          in another country, a person may travel to attend the funeral prayers 
          if that is easy to do. There is nothing wrong with this travelling because 
          it is travelling for a legitimate purpose, even though this action was 
          not known among Muslims in the past. It was not done in the past because 
          they were not able to do that, unlike today when travelling has become 
          easier with faster methods of transportation. 
 With regard to offering the funeral 
          prayer for the deceased in absentia, there is a great deal of difference 
          of opinion among the scholars on this matter, because it is not reported 
          that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) did that, except in the case of the Negus (ruler 
          of Abyssinia), and it was not narrated that the Muslims outside of Madeenah 
          prayed for the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) in absentia when he died, even though 
          their love for him was so great. 
 Also, it is not reported that the Muslims 
          prayed in absentia for any of the khulafaa’ al-raashideen (the rightly-guided 
          khaleefahs, the first four leaders of Islam after the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) when they died. Prayer 
          for the dead in absentia was not known among the Muslims even though 
          circumstances might have dictated it, such as the eagerness of the Muslims 
          to do something of benefit for their brothers, especially those who 
          were held in high esteem by all the Muslims, or one to whom one is related 
          or who one is fond of, which would make one seek to do something good 
          for him by praying for him. For this reason, scholars such as Shaykh 
          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah were of the view that the fact that the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) prayed for the Negus was an exceptional case which applied 
          only to him, because there was no one in the land where he died who 
          could offer the janaazah prayer for him. In my view, this is a sound 
          view in the light of the above. Some scholars say that the funeral prayer 
          in absentia may be offered only for certain people among the ummah, 
          such as famous scholars and just rulers; this view is close to the previous 
          view. 
 On this basis, there is no reason why 
          the funeral prayer should not be offered for the deceased both when 
          one is present and in absentia. 
 Secondly: 
Gathering to read Qur’aan and give the reward for that 
          to the deceased is a bid’ah (reprehensible innovation), even if it is 
          not done in return for any payment. If it is done in return for payment 
          then it is haraam, because it is being done for a reason other than 
          for the sake of Allaah, and any such action will not earn any reward. 
          But if a person reads Qur’aan by himself and gives the reward for that 
          to a relative or friend, without gathering with others for that purpose 
          and without seeking payment, then there are two scholarly views in this 
          case, one of which says that it is permissible and that the reward for 
          the reading will reach the deceased. 
 The second view is that it is not prescribed 
          to give the reward for the reading to anyone, because there is no evidence 
          (daleel) to indicate that this is prescribed. 
 Thirdly: 
If the family of the deceased have a special reading, 
          and invite people to a meal three days and forty days after the death, 
          this is bid’ah (reprehensible innovation). 
 And every bid’ah is a going astray. 
          The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever invents something 
          in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not a part of it will have 
          it rejected.” The action mentioned is a matter that has been invented 
          in the religion, so it is to be rejected, and the one who does it is 
          a sinner and will not be rewarded. 
 What people say about the soul of the 
          deceased visiting the house after forty days to get the reward is a 
          lie which has no basis. The person who told you that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions did not 
          do any of these things was right. You did well to ask about the things 
          of which you were unsure, and your eagerness to know the Sunnah of the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) and act accordingly is highly commendable. This 
          is how the Muslim should be; his concern should be to know the truth 
          so that he can follow it, and know what is false so that he can avoid 
          it. 
 We ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast 
          in following the Straight Path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad 
          and his family and companions, and grant them peace."

Which view is correct?","The more correct opinion is that Sujud al-Tilawah is an act of worship, but it is not like prayer. So, it is not essential to be in a state of wudu or to face the qiblah when you offer sujud al-tilawah.","Praise be to Allah.“Some of the scholars regard Sujud al-Tilawah as being a form of prayer, and on this basis they say that it is essential to be in a state of taharah, to face the qiblah, to say Takbir when going down and when sitting up, and to say salam after the prostration. 
Other scholars say that Sujud al-Tilawah is an act of worship, but it is not like prayer, and on this basis they say that it is not essential to be in a state of taharah, to face the qiblah, etc., as stated before. This is the more correct opinion, because we do not know of any evidence to suggest that taharah and facing the Qiblah are essential, but if it is easy to face the Qiblah when doing the prostration and to be in a state of taharah, then this is better, so as to avoid dispute and to be in accordance with all the scholars.

WHEN A NON-MUSLIM SAYS SALAM U ALAIKUM(GREETS YOU) HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND?",,"Praise be to Allah.Muslim reported in his Saheeh (14/144) from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the People of the Book say salam to you (greet you by saying al-salamu alaykum), say ‘Wa ‘alaykum’ (and unto you).’” According to another report, he was asked, “The People of the Book say salam to us. How should we respond?” He said, “Say, ‘Wa ‘alaykum.’” According to another report (14/164), he said, “When the Jews greet you, they say ‘al-saam ‘alaykum (death be upon you). So say ‘ ‘alayk (upon you).’” According to another report he said, “So say, ‘wa ‘alayk’ (and upon you).” According to another report (14/146) a group of Jews asked for permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and they said, “Al-saam ‘alaykum (death be upon you).” ‘Aa’ishah said, “Bal ‘alaykum al-saam wa’l-la’nah (No, death be upon you and curses)!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “O ‘Aa’ishah, Allah loves gentleness in all things.” She said, “Did you not hear what they said?” He said, “I answered, ‘Wa ‘alaykum (and unto you).’” According to another report, he said, “I answered, ‘ ‘alaykum’” – without the “waw” (i.e., wa meaning “and”). According to the last hadeeth (14/148), he said, “Do not initiate the greeting of salam with the Jews and Christians, and if you meet one of them on the road, push him to the narrowest part of it.”
All of these reports were narrated in the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim.
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (14/144-145):
The scholars agree that the greeting of the People of the Book should be returned, if they greet us with salam, but we should not say to them, “Wa ‘alaykum al-salam (and upon you be peace).” We should say only “ ‘alaykum (upon you)” or “wa ‘alaykum (and upon you).” Ahaadeeth have been narrated by Muslim both with and without the “wa” (“And”), but most of them include it. On this basis, there are two meanings, one of which is the apparent meaning: if they say “ ‘Alaykum al-mawt (death be upon you)”, then one should say, “Wa ‘alaykum (and also on you)” – meaning that we and you are alike, we are all going to die. The second meaning is that this is a waw that is used to start a new idea or phrase, not to connect it to the previous sentence or to reiterate the same idea. This implies: and upon you be what you deserve of condemnation. The phrase without the wa implies: but rather death should be upon you. Al-Qaadi said: some of the scholars, including Ibn Habeeb al-Maliki, preferred to use the phrase without the wa, so that it would not have the implication that these people are like the Muslims. Others said that it should be used with the wa as it appears in the majority of reports. Some of them said: he should reply “ ‘alaykum al-silaam (and upon you be stones) – but this is da’eef (weak). Al-Khattaabi said: most of the muhadditheen (scholars of hadeeth) reported it with the wa (wa ‘alaykum), but Ibn ‘Uyaynah reported it without the waw. Al-Khattaabi said: this is what is correct, because if the phrase is used without the waw, this means that what they are saying is returned specifically and exclusively to them, but if the waw is used, it implies commonality with them in what they are saying. This is the view of al-Khattaabi. But the correct view is that it is permissible either to use the waw or omit it, as both have been mentioned in saheeh reports, but including the waw is better, as it appears in most of the reports. There is nothing wrong with that, because al-saam means death, which will come to us and to them, so there is no harm in including the waw. The scholars differed as to returning the greeting of salam when a kaafir initiates it or initiating the greeting. Our opinion is that it is haraam to initiate the greeting, but we have to return their greeting by saying “Wa ‘alaykum” or just “ ‘alaykum.” Our evidence with regard to initiating the greeting is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not initiate the greeting with the Jews and Christians” and his command to reply by saying, “Wa ‘alaykum.” What we have mentioned as our madhhab or point of view is also the opinion of most of the scholars and the majority of the salaf… It is permissible to initiate the greeting when addressed to a group composed of both Muslims and kaafirs, or one Muslim and a number of kaafirs, but he should intend the greeting to be directed towards the Muslim(s) among them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) greeted an assembly that included a mixture of Muslims and mushrikeen."
1238,4983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4983,Are the Sufi    shaykhs really in contact with Allaah?,"Question

What is the place of sufism in Islam? What truth is there in 'religious experiences', contacts with the Divine, etc.? Some people hold such phenomena in high regard, claiming the similarities between experiences of people from different religions and from opposite corners of the globe, to be proof. How should people who claim to be sufis or believers/followers of sufism be seen? Isn't prayer and remembrance also a form of contact with the Almighty, SWT?",,"Praise be to Allah.The word Sufism was not known at the time of the Messenger or the Sahaabah or the Taabieen. It arose at the time when a group of ascetics who wore wool (soof) emerged, and this name was given to them. It was also said that the name was taken from the word soofiya (sophia) which means wisdom in Greek. The word is not derived from al-safa (purity) as some of them claim, because the adjective derived from safa is safaai, not soofi (sufi). The emergence of this new name and the group to whom it is applied exacerbated the divisions among Muslims. The early Sufis differed from the later Sufis who spread bidah (innovation) to a greater extent and made shirk in both minor and major forms commonplace among the people, as well as the innovations against which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us when he said, Beware of newly-invented things, for every newly-invented thing is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is saheeh hasan).
The following is a comparison between the beliefs and rituals of Sufism and Islam which is based on the Quraan and Sunnah.
Sufism has numerous branches or tareeqahs, such as the Teejaniyyah, Qaadiriyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, Shaadhiliyyah, Rifaaiyyah, etc., the followers of which all claim that their particular tareeqah is on the path of truth whilst the others are following falsehood. Islam forbids such sectarianism. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
and be not of al-mushrikoon (the disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, idolaters, etc),
Of those who split up their religion (i.e., who left the true Islamic monotheism), and became sects, [i.e., they invented new things in the religion (bidah) and followed their vain desires], each sect rejoicing in that which is with it. [al-Room 30:31-32]
The Sufis worship others than Allaah, such as Prophets and awliya [saints], living or dead. They say, Yaa Jeelaani, Yaa Rifaai [calling on their awliya], or O Messenger of Allaah, help and save or O Messenger of Allaah, our dependence is on you, etc.
But Allaah forbids us to call on anyone except Him in matters that are beyond the person's capabilities. If a person does this, Allaah will count him as a mushrik, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
And invoke not, besides Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers). [Yoonus 10:106]
The Sufis believe that there are abdaal, aqtaab and awliya (kinds of saints) to whom Allaah has given the power to run the affairs of the universe. Allaah tells us about the mushrikeen (interpretation of the meaning):
Say [O Muhammad]: And who disposes the affairs? They will say. Allaah. [Yoonus 10:31]
The mushrik Arabs knew more about Allaah than these Sufis!
The Sufis turn to other than Allaah when calamity strikes, but Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And if Allaah touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is Able to do all things. [al-Anaam 6:17]
Some Sufis believe in wahdat al-wujood (unity of existence). They do not have the idea of a Creator and His creation, instead they say that everything is creation and everything is god.
The Sufis advocate extreme asceticism in this life and do not believe in taking the necessary means or in jihaad, but Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
But seek with that (wealth) which Allaah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world [al-Qasas 28:77]
And make ready against them all that you can of power   [al-Anfaal 8:60]
The Sufis refer the idea of ihsaan to their shaykhs and tell their followers to have a picture of their shaykh in mind when they remember Allaah and even when they are praying. Some of them even put a picture of their shaykh in front of them when they are praying. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Ihsaan is when you worship Allaah as if you can see Him, and although you cannot see Him, He can see you. (Reported by Muslim).
The Sufis allow dancing, drums and musical instruments, and raising the voice when making dhikr, but Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
The believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts [al-Anfaal 8:2]
Moreover, you see some of them making dhikr by only pronouncing the Name of Allaah, saying, Allaah, Allaah, Allaah. This is bidah and has no meaning in Islam. They even go to the extreme of saying, Ah, ah or Hu, Hu. The Sunnah is for the Muslim to remember his Lord in words that have a true meaning for which he will be rewarded, such as saying Subhaan Allaah wa Alhamdulillah wa Laa ilaaha illa Allaah wa Allaahu akbar, and so on.
The Sufis recite love poems mentioning the names of women and boys in their dhikr gatherings, and they repeat words such as love, passion, desire and so on, as if they are in a gathering where people dance and drink wine and clap and shout. All of this has to do with the customs and acts of worship of the mushrikeen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Their salaah (prayer) at the House (of Allaah, i.e., the Kabah at Makkah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands
[al-Anfaal 8:35]
Some Sufis pierce themselves with rods of iron, saying, O my grandfather! So the shayaateen come to them and help them, because they are seeking the help of someone other than Allaah . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allaah), We appoint for him a shaytaan (devil) to be a qareen (intimate companion) for him.
[al-Zukhruf 43:36]
The Sufis claim to have gnosis and knowledge of the unseen, but the Quraan shows them to be liars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the ghayb (unseen) except Allaah [al-Naml 27:65]
The Sufis claim that Allaah created the world for the sake of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but the Quraan shows them to be liars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone). [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, addressed His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the words (interpretation of the meaning):
And worship your Lord until there comes unto the certainty (i.e., death). [al-Hijr 15:99]
The Sufis claim that they can see Allaah in this life, but the Quraan shows them to be liars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
[Moosa said:] O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You. Allaah said, You cannot see Me [al-Araaf 7:143]
The Sufis claim that they take knowledge directly from Allaah, without the mediation of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in a conscious state (as opposed to dreams). So are they better than the Sahaabah??
The Sufis claim that they take knowledge directly from Allaah, without the mediation of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They say, Haddathani qalbi an Rabbi (My heart told me from my Lord).
The Sufis celebrate Mawlid and hold gatherings for sending blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but they go against his teachings by raising their voices in dhikr and anaasheed (religious songs) and qaseedahs (poems) that contain blatant shirk. Did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) celebrate his birthday? Did Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, the four imaams or anyone else celebrate his birthday? Who knows more and is more correct in worship, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Salaf, or the Sufis?
The Sufis travel to visit graves and seek blessings from their occupants or to make tawaaf (ritual circumambulation) around them or to make sacrifices at these sites, all of which goes against the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Do not travel to visit any place but three mosques: al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah], this mosque of mine [in Madeenah] and al-Masjid al-Aqsa [in Jerusalem]. (Agreed upon).
The Sufis are blindly loyal to their shaykhs, even when what they go against the words of Allaah and His Messenger. But Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
O you who believe! Do not put (yourselves) forward before Allaah and His Messenger [al-Hujuraat 49:1]
The Sufis use talismans, letters and numbers for making decisions and for making amulets and charms and so on.
The Sufis do not restrict themselves to the specific blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that were narrated from him. They invented new formulas that involve seeking his blessings and other kinds of blatant shirk which are unacceptable to the one on whom they are sending blessings.
With regard to the question of the whether the Sufi shaykhs have some kind of contact, this is true, but their contact is with the shayaateen, not with Allaah, so they inspire one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies shayaateen (devils) among mankind and jinns, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it [al-Anaam 6:112]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And, certainly, the shayaateen (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) [al-Anaam 6:121]
Shall I inform you (O people!) upon whom the shayaateen (devils) descend?
They descend on every lying, sinful person. [al-Shuara 221-222]
This is the contact that is real, not the contact that they falsely claim to have with Allaah. Exalted be Allaah far above that.
(See Mujam al-Bida, 346 359).
When some of these Sufi shaykhs disappear suddenly from the sight of their followers, this is the result of their contact with the shayaateen, who may even carry them to a distant place and bring them back in the same day or night, to mislead their human followers.
So the important rule here is not to judge people by the extraordinary feats that they may do. We should judge them by how closely or otherwise they adhere to the Quraan and Sunnah. The true friends of Allaah (awliya) are not necessarily known for performing astounding feats. On the contrary, they are the ones who worship Allaah in the manner that He has prescribed, and not by doing acts of bidah. The true awliya or friends of Allaah are those whom our Lord has described in the hadeeth qudsi narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (5/2384) from Abu Hurayrah, who said:
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah said, Whoever shows enmity towards a friend (wali) of Mine, I declare war against him. My slave does not draw close to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties that I have enjoined on him, and My slave continues to draw close to Me with supererogatory (naafil) acts, so that I will love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.
And Allaah is the Source of Strength and the Guide to the Straight Path."

    become Muslim but she cannot accept some of the rulings such as hijaab and doing the
    prayers on time.","Question

                I was born in a French catholic family. My
      parents are strong and sincere believers, and I respect that a lot.Now I'm very interested in Islam, but there are a couple of reasons that
      ""prevent"" me from converting. For instance, as a woman, I cannot accept
      polygamy, the fact of stoning people who had an affair, of always depend on a
      ""mahram""...Furthermore, it's not ""easy"" to be and live as a Muslim in a
      western country : in my job, I wouldn't be able to wear a veil, not to shake men's hands
      anymore, pray 5 times a day... And my parents (especially my mother who is sick) would be
      very sad seeing me leaving Christianity.So my question is to know how I can convert in such conditions. Is there a
      kind of ""minimum"" required ? I mean, considering that there are still things
      which I don't accept, wouldn't it be better for me to wait ?Thanks for your help.",,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-Uthaymeen:
A non-Muslim woman is saying, I want to become Muslim but on the
    condition that I do not have to do the five prayers until the end of the day, because I
    cannot do them at work. And also I cannot accept the idea of polygamy.
He answered as follows:
I think that she should adhere to the rulings of
    Islam if she wants to become Muslim and be saved from the Fire. But as for her choosing
    what she wants and saying I cannot accept the idea of polygamy  as if she is saying
    that she cannot accept it as a ruling from Allaah  or saying I cannot pray until I
    finish my work, this is not acceptable.
    Question:
In the book Muntaqa al-Akhbaar, the author says,
    Chapter on the soundness of a persons Islam when he lays down invalid
    conditions, and he mentions the hadeeth of Waheeb, who said:
I asked Jaabir about the tribe of Thaqeef, when they gave their
    Bayah (oath of allegiance) to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allâh be upon
    him), with the condition that they would not have to pay Sadaqah (charity) or engage in
    Jihaad. After that he heard the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allâh be upon him) say,
    They will give sadaqah and they will engage in jihaad.
Can we understand from this that if a non-Muslim comes and says I
    want to become Muslim on the condition that I can do all the prayers together at the end
    of the day this is OK, or is this an entirely different case?
Shaykh:
This is an entirely different case, because when that was said to the
    Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he said, If they become
    Muslim, they will pray. This has to do with matters of the Unseen, which we cannot
    know. (in other words, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted
    that from them because he knew, from what Allaah taught him of the Unseen, that these
    people would become good Muslims and would give charity and engage in jihaad, whereas we
    cannot know the Unseen and how this non-Muslim will be in the future). If we accepted the
    conditions laid down by the kuffaar, Islam would disintegrate. One may stipulate the
    condition that we let him engage in zinaa (unlawful sexual activity), another may demand
    that we let him drink wine, and so on and so forth. The Messenger 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allâh be upon him) told Ali, when he sent him to the people of
    Khaybar: Tell them what their duties are towards Allaah in Islam. The
    condition of Islam is that it must be accepted in totality, as it is. The Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allâh be upon him) told Muaadh, Teach them that Allaah has
    enjoined five prayers upon them, and if they accept that, then tell them about
    Zakaah. So the obligations of Islam have to be accepted.
Question:
Can we not say that this persons entering Islam serves a great
    interest, and that their stipulating that they should be excused a few acts of worship is
    less harmful?
Shaykh: Not at all! Whose interests are being served here? The
    interests of the person himself? But this is damaging to Islam, because then lazy Muslims
    will say, We will only pray when we have finished work, like this person does.
    So the harm this would do to Islam is serious. If he really wants to save himself, let him
    accept Islam in totality. And whomsoever Allaah leads astray, no-one can
    guide.
So what we say to you is this: become Muslim and accept Islam in
    totality. Submit to Allaah in all that He has prescribed, and Allaah will help you and
    give you the strength to follow His laws, if you are sincere in your intention towards
    Him. Then if you are faced with something that you cannot do for a genuine reason, or are
    forced to do something, then if you are sincere, Allaah will not punish you for that. May
    Allaah help us and you to accept the truth and adhere to it. May Allaah bless our Prophet
    Muhammad."

                Before I get to my question, I would
      like to introduce myself a little. I am a muslim girl in Sweden, who got a question from a
      christian person. I've asked everyone around me and tried to find the answer by looking
      in books, internet, but unfortunately whithout any results.The question was about huriyat
      (several women), according to what I've heard it is several women that the muslim men will
      be ""awarded"" with,in janna(heaven).I don't know if this information is right,
      but if you could give me a little bit more information about this, I would be thankful.
      The main question is: -Why does Islam encourage something in janna(heaven), which is
      forbidden here on earth?. Whith that he means, that a relationship outside marriage is according to Islam- haram (forbidden), if they(muslim
      men)avoid this on earth, they will be awarded with huriyat in janna. Isn't that very
      strange? Unfortunately a know very little about this subject, I don't know where he got
      this question, but I am sure there is a logical explanation for this question, which I
      hope to find answer to.I would be very grateful, if you could help me with this question,
      thank you for your time!",,"Praise be to Allah.In His Holy Book, Allaah has mentioned Paradise and what
    He has prepared therein. He has mentioned the attributes of Paradise and of its people in
    numerous places in the Quraan, such as the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):
Therein will be a running spring.
Therein will be thrones raised high.
And cups set at hand.
And cushions set in rows.
And rich carpets (all) spread out
[al-Ghaashiyah 88:12-16]
But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will
    be two Gardens (i.e. in Paradise). 
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men)

With spreading branches.

In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free).
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men)

In them (both) will be every kind of fruit in pairs.
[al-Rahmaan 55:46-52]
Wherein both will be Qaasiraat ut-Tarf [chaste females
    (wives) restraining their glances, desiring none except - their husbands], with whom no
    man or jinni has had Tamth [sexual intercourse] before them. 
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men)
    deny?
(In beauty) they are like rubies and coral.
[al-Rahmaan 55:56-58]
Hoor (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions
[al-Rahmaan 55:72]
And (there will be) Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes
    (as wives for Al-Muttaqoon  the pious). 
Like unto preserved pearls.
A reward for what they used to do.
[al-Waaqiah 56:22-24]
There are many saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) which describe the women of Paradise and state that they will be
    prepared on the Day of Resurrection for the muttaqoon (pious). Among these
    ahaadeeth is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said, the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
The first group to enter Paradise will look like the moon on the
    night when it is full, then those who follow them will look like the brightest star in the
    sky; they will not urinate or defecate or spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of
    gold and their sweat will be musk and their incense-burners will be pearls. Their wives
    will be al-hoor al-iyn. Their appearance will be the same and they will look
    like their father Adam who was sixty cubits tall.
(Saheeh al-Jaami, 2015).
It was also reported that he 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: A tent will be a pearl sixty miles high, in each corner of
    which will be a wife for the believer whom no one else will see. (Saheeh
    al-Jaami, 3357). 
    In these ahaadeeth the women of Paradise are mentioned
    who have been prepared for the men. In His Book, Allaah called them al-Hoor. Al-Hoor
    is the plural of Hooraa . Al-Qurtubi said in al-Ahkaam (17/12):
    (This means) a woman in whose eyes the white is intensely white and the black is
    intensely black. We believe in that with absolute faith uncontaminated with any
    doubts. It is part of the essentials of our belief. For more information see Saheeh
    al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Bad al-Khalq, Baab Sifat al-Jannah; and Saheeh
    Muslim, Abwaab Sifat al-Jannah; and Sifat al-Jannah by
    Abul-Naeem al-Isfahaani, which describes the women of the people of Paradise
    and their beauty.
With regard to the question about why Islam encourages and gives glad
    tidings of things in Paradise which are forbidden in this world, such as men having
    intimate relationships with women outside of the framework of marriage  before we
    answer this question, we must make a serious point, which is that Allaah forbids whatever
    He wills in this world to its people, for He is the Creator and Sovereign of these things,
    so it is not permissible for anyone to object to the ruling of Allaah on the basis of his
    foolish thinking and imperfect understanding. The ruling and the decision of the matter,
    before and after, is only with Allaah, and there is none who can overturn His ruling, may
    He be glorified and exalted.
With regard to the question of why Allaah forbids some things in this
    world, then in the Hereafter will permit them as a reward to those who abstained from them
    (such as wine, zinaa, wearing silk for men, etc.), this is what Allaah wills to give as a
    reward to those who obey Him and patiently strive in this world. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
Is there any reward for good other than good?
    [al-Rahmaan 55:60]
With regard to the reason why these things are forbidden, there follow
    a few important points:
Firstly:
We do not necessarily know all the reasons why things are forbidden.
    There are some reasons which we do not know. The basic principle is to accept and submit
    to the texts even if we do not know the reason, because submission is the point of Islam
    which is based on complete obedience to Allaah, may He be exalted.
Secondly:
Some of the reasons for the prohibitions may be clear to us, such as
    the corruptions that result from zinaa, e.g., the mixing of lineages, the spread of fatal
    diseases and so on. When Islam forbids unlawful relationships, the intention is to protect
    peoples lineage and honour, which may not mean anything to the kaafirs and immoral
    people, who jump on one another like donkeys, with a boyfriend having intercourse with his
    girlfriend and people having intercourse with their own relatives and so on, as if they
    are in the jungle. Indeed, they are worse than animals, for some animals refuse to do such
    a thing, but these people do not refuse and do not care. As a result of this promiscuity,
    the ties that bind society disintegrate and it becomes filled with fatal sexual diseases
    which are an indication of the wrath of Allaah towards those who violate His sacred limits
    and make permissible that which is forbidden.
This is unlike the relationship of a man with the Hooris in
    Paradise  which is what has been asked about here  for we may note that in the
    case of a promiscuous woman in this world, her honour is readily available to all and she
    has no religious commitment or shame. She is not bound by a lawful relationship to one
    person. So men and women have intercourse with whomever they want, with no restrictions of
    religion or morality. But the hooris in Paradise are restrained and restricted to
    their husbands to whom Allaah has given them as a reward for their patience in abstaining
    from haraam things in this world. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
Hoor (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions
[al-Rahmaan 55:72]
with whom no man or jinni has had Tamth [sexual intercourse]
    before them. [al-Rahmaan 55:56]
The hoori is a wife for the man, as Allaah says (interpretation
    of the meaning):
 and We shall marry them to Hooris [female fair ones]
    with wide, lovely eyes [al-Dukhaan 44:54].
And they will be confined to their husbands, and no one else will have
    a share in them.
Thirdly:
Allaah  who has declared that in this world a man is not
    permitted to have more than four wives at one time  is the One Who will bless the
    people of Paradise with whatever He wills of al-hoor al-iyn. So there is no
    contradiction between what is forbidden in this world and in the Hereafter, because the
    rulings of each are different, in accordance with what the Lord wills. Undoubtedly the
    Hereafter is far better and more lasting than this world. Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning):
Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women,
    children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and
    well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present worlds life; but Allaah has
    the excellent return (Paradise with flowing rivers) with Him.
Say: Shall I inform you of things far better than those? For
    Al-Muttaqoon (the pious) there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which
    rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azwaajun Mutahharatun (purified mates
    or wives). And Allaah will be pleased with them. And Allaah is All-Seer of the (His)
    slaves.
[Aal Imraan 3:14-15]
Fourthly:
This prohibition may be a kind of test from Allaah to His slaves, to
    see whether they will obey these commands and avoid that which He has forbidden. The test
    could not be with regard to something for which people have no inclination and which they
    do not like; it has to be with regard to something to which they are inclined and
    attracted. This testing may include wealth  will a person take from that which is
    permitted and dispose of it in manners which are permitted, and will he fulfil the rights
    which Allaah has over it? The test with regard to women is: will he restrict himself to
    that which Allaah has permitted him of women, and will he lower his gaze and avoid seeking
    pleasure in that which Allaah has forbidden. It is an aspect of Allaahs mercy 
    may He be exalted and glorified  that He does not forbid something to which people
    are inclined without allowing something of that nature and there is much which is
    permitted.
Fifthly:
The rulings (ahkaam) of this world are not like the rulings of
    the Hereafter. The wine of this world causes people to lose their minds, unlike the good
    wine of the Hereafter which does not make people lose their minds or cause headaches or
    stomachaches. What Allaah has prepared for the believers of women on the Day of
    Resurrection as a reward for their obedience is not like zinaa which violates
    peoples honour, confuses lineages, spreads diseases and leads to regret. The women
    of Paradise are pure and good; they will never die or get old, unlike the women of this
    world. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, We have created them (maidens) of special creation.
And made them virgins.
Loving (their husbands only), (and) of equal age
[al-Waaqiah 56:35]
We ask Allaah to bless us with the best of this world and the next, and
    to help us to be obedient to His commands and to have certain faith in His reward and to
    keep us safe from His punishment. And Allaah knows best."

well i want to make a little inquiry plz kindly inform with the correct info I have heard that you are not supposed to have sex on tuesdays....and there is some thing that comes that night which then curses all those who are doing it...and they suffer some how later...then plz reply me and inform me with the correct info...from hadiths or Quran..",,"Praise be to Allah.I know, may Allaah teach us and you, that this is one of the myths and innovations that have no basis on the Qur’aan or Sunnah. It is like the things said by the people who follow innovations and are misguided, so that they say that it is makrooh to get married when the moon is in Scorpio or when it is under the rays [???], or when it is waning or in any of its other stages.
(See Mu’jam al-Bida’ by Raa’id Sabri, 656).
Allaah has permitted intercourse at all times and in all places, with the following exceptions:


During the day in Ramadaan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of al-siyaam (the fasts). They are libaas (body cover, screen, etc.) for you and you are the same for them. Allaah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring)…” [al-Baqarah 2:187]


During the woman’s period [hayd] and when she is still bleeding after childbirth [nifaas]. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them until they have purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allaah has ordained for you…” [al-Baqarah 2:222]


In the mosques. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I’tikaaf (i.e., confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not…” [al-Baqarah 2:187]




And in other situations, such as when one is muhrim (in a state of ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah). You will not find anything in the Qur’aan or Sunnah to confirm this lie. It is a kind of evil falsehood that has cheated a lot of people, so that now they hold it as some kind of inflexible belief. Many people have had intercourse with their wives on a Tuesday and have conceived healthy children. No harm has befallen either them or their children because of that. May Allaah protect us and you from bid’ah and evil. And Allaah knows best."
